Bought a new weight distribution hitch that came equipped with a 2&#34; ball ... I needed a 2-5/16&#34; ball for my larger travel trailer but wanted one with the larger big beefy 1-1/4&#34; shank ... my WD hitch had a hole for that size and NO WAY would I go buy a 2-5/16&#34; ball with a smaller diameter shank and use a spacer in it!I want to best thickest built ball and shank and I could not find a ball this size with this larger shank here locally.Price was great and I love having a big bad boy ball and shank to pull the 5-6K load of my trailer.Very nice sturdy chock with a convenient synthetic leash.  Looks just like the one pictured.  I purchased two.  The price is for one each.  The size is just right for compact vehicles such as a Ford Ranger or other small Truck or Car with Stock Tires.I purchased these to replace a wheel on my Craftsman portable generator.  Appear identical to the OEM wheel and the fit was perfect.  For light use they're perfect and the price is unbeatable.
It's sta-bil how can it be wrong and this is the best price I could find. I am very happy.Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.It is exactly as it is advertised. It seems well built. If this is what you need just buy it.
These are basically a good product. I would say they are better than the OE catches on my RV. But make sure you keep the screws from the existing catches, or better yet, buy a pack of stainless screws. These do not come with mounting screws. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.Caps do the job, noting special, but if you have lost one of your valeve caps these are good replacement for factoryput them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease.

I really like this charger. You can select the settings for normal, deep cycle, and AMG batteries. You can select small or large batteries. You can set the reading to watch between volt reading or % of charge. Great product for the money!This are sooooo useful. I can't tell you how many of those stupid hooks or fasteners i broke before discovering these in a car forum. I hate those plastic fasteners. This solved my problem, they are perfect and has several different shapes and sizes. Thank god i found these.  I don't understand how people can give these bad ratings.If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Fantastic price for a very handy tool in the garage!  When working on automotive and motorcycle accessories one needs to &#34;power them up&#34; to test them or their function and this power source provides the juice required.

Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.

Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.this product does what it is supposed to do, but, I am not real happy with the quality of construction.It is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy again
the old one croaked after 5 years so the product description said this was a direct replacement for the model we had.  It's close, the mounting hole is &#34;off&#34; about 1/8&#34; so be prepared to deal with this discrepancy.Well, This was a tough decision for me.  The reviews are mostly either &#34;Love it or Hate it&#34;... so I took a chance and purchased one. I had a &#34;bargain&#34; brand battery installed in my Suzuki SX4 and it was leaking acid all over everything.  Well, I have been using this for about a month now with anywhere from 40 degrees above to 20 degrees below zero temperatures... and it hasn't failed me once.  It seems to be a good battery... so far.  I do notice that it doesn't like to sit for a couple of weeks before starting your vehicle though... it loses some of it's &#34;umph&#34;.  I am considering the battery tender to make sure it is charged up (my vehicle isn't used every day).  Only time will tell whether this battery is worth the price tag.  I have another quality brand in a different vehicle that is awesome and doesn't ever lose any of its charge... ever.Summarily... I think this battery is a decent choice of high end batteries.  Is it the best?  Only time will tell.  Is it the worst?  I don't think so.  I think the Optima battery line is a viable choice when you are in the market for a battery.As for the shipping:  The battery arrived in perfect condition and was well protected by the packaging.  The battery was fully charged upon receipt (read 14V DC on my Fluke meter).Product arrived on-time from amazon. Purchased this for an old motorcycle that I was tired of swapping chargers with.  I opted to give this one a try because of all the positive reviews.  This charger is just a poorly made product.  Even though is was $20, and less than other brands I have purchased, I think it is a waste of money. First, it says it is for agm batteries, but only charges a battery at 14.3v.  Agm's need a higher voltage than this (in fact all batteries need a higher voltage than this). Second, it would not bring my battery up to a full charge. Lastly, the charger runs really hot, so I was afraid to leave this connected for a long period of time. Frustrated, I decided to open up the charger, and to my surprise, all there is is a transformer and a diode.  For a transformer in a box, I should have paid a lot less.
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet.Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat.this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter.
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!this stuff cleaned my intake filter like a charm! next time i will buy an aerosol version though as this one is kind of dirty to use :)I am happy with this purchase. I already knew these magnetic part pans are excellent. If you will use it a lot, get one.
If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.These are a whole lot better than my stock nozzle. Will spray a fan of fluid, it is adjustable and comes with the adjuster key, silver thing in the picture.The only thing I wish was different was being able to adjust the spray higher than what the limit is at now. It is just barely clearing the whipper blade, but the stock one had been so clogged that is wasn't getting above it at all.It is on a ball type adjustment, so all angles and such, just the angle of my hood is the issue, overall, way better and even spread.As high beams are on only when its really dark I liked the increased field of vision how it increased the sides and the length of what I can see.  Yes I would buy them again.
arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.
bought this to charge / maintain spare batteries not in my truck, worked perfectly.great product,would buy again.good service.fits battery tender.This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youDon't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!
I have a 2013 SUV which has problems maintaining a battery charge for more than a few days. Lexus supplied a non-waterproof, but more powerful Battery Tender. Problem is that I park the vehicle outside, so I bought this model. It charges and maintains the battery, but to reach full charge takes about 1 1/2 times longer than the one with the Lexus label. By the way, the Lexus model is just a re-labeled Battery Tender, as is the re-labeled BMW model I also have.I can confirm this oil filter fits the 2013 Sears/Craftsman GT6000 garden tractor.  The price was right., quite a bit better than the OEM Kohler junk filter Sears sells.  Walmart carries a Purolator L10241 for a buck less, but it's not the same quality/rating as this Purolator PL10241, 99.9% PureOne filter.I replaced air filters in two Toyotas: 2003 4 cylinder Camry and 2006 4 cylinder Highlander. It fits perfectly, the installation is easy, and it was much cheaper on Amazon than at the dealer.  The only difference from the original Denso filters I purchased at a Toyota dealer is that Amazon's version's color is pink.

For a transformer in a box, I should have paid a lot less.I use this to monitor my RV battery.  Even though I have a solar system charge controller which displays voltage too, I use this sometimes to double check before I plug additional items in one of several 12 volt sockets I had installed.  I like it so much for its simplicity, that I'm buying a 2nd one for my truck.  This gadget is so simple to use and so accurate, that if you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.  More than worth the price!  Gives me a peace of mind at a glance.I used this video to quiet a steel enclosure for a CNC mill. The product works perfectly. The amount I bought was overkill, but I saved on shipping and actual product price. My plan is to contact local stereo installers to see if they want to buy my surplus. If not, there are a myriad of items in my home that need some damping :) Used a wallpaper seam roller which worked fine.
I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged.Well worth the price.  Was able to charge my cell phone on a long motorcycle trip.  Also used it to charge my mp3 players while riding.Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.
For 30 years, I have been fighting with dead batteries on seasonal vehicles like ATVs, mowers, tractors and emergency generators.  In spite of my best efforts, I always managed to miss at least one battery when making my charging rounds every month or so.Batteries can be stubborn.  They only turn up dead when you need them the most.A life span of 12 months for a 12V lawn and garden battery was acceptable. After all, the warranty is only 3 months.Some motorcycle and ATV batteries cost as much as a car battery and 12 months was about the best I could hope for.About 4 years ago, I began using the Battery Tenders on all of my seasonal and special use batteries.  My 12V lawn and garden and ATV batteries are lasting between 3 and 4 years now.The big 12V, 72-month generator battery might last forever.  It went out of warranty in 2010.Lawn & garden batteries cost about the same as the Battery Tender Junior which means that I'm saving about $48.00 every 3 years on each piece of equipment that uses such a battery.If I'd been using Battery Tenders on my ATVs for the past 30 years, I could have retired much earlier.I drive a BMW 530i. I ordered and installed these plugs myself a couple of weeks ago. This will probably be the ONLY spark plug change my car will receive from me as these are 100,000 mile plugs. At 95,000 miles my old plugs were still in decent condition and could have had another 20,000 miles put on them as far as I could tell. My number 1 cylinder plug had a couple of small pits in two of the four prongs. Regular plugs would have burned out long before 95,000 miles.If your car specs support these plugs BUY THEM as they will probably be your last spark plug change for that vehicle.I have several Classic cars, a motorcycle battery, and two boat batteries that I need to keep charged, so I purchased the Battery Tender 4-Bank Battery Management System to help me keep the batteries at the optimum charge level over long periods of non-use.I have had several batteries go bad from overcharging on regular battery chargers, and from sulphating when not using or charging them for extended periods.  I decided to get the Deltran 4-Bank system to extend the useful life of my batteries  and hopefully, it will pay for itself in prolonged battery life for all of my different battery applications.
One question i have now that i read the bottom of the filter box saying "Made in Mexico"We all know "Made in China" means it was made good but with bad materials, so results can be OK or horrible depending on what it is, but how about filters ?Doing research i found that mexico's advantage could be the shipping price, but not much talk about quality of the assembly or material quality.Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road.  Sand = Nope. Mud = Nope.  Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly. (I know from experience - ugh)While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.
Torin T43002A 3 ton double locking jack stands.  I know of other individuals that have use these and I decided that I needed them tooI have six of these JR's attached to all my toys,boat batteries,RV batteries, tractor batteries, side by side batteries...you get the point! No issue and will pay for themselves extending the life of those $100-200 batteries trust me!got 3 of these and use them all - work great. I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat.What can we say about this thermostat? It is a Stant. Arguably, the best thermostat available for cars. It was priced right and processed/delivered promptly.Second one I have bought... That should tell You this is the best Jeep hitch for the money... Extended is the greatest for trailering with outside spare...  Giddy-Up.
Our Battery Tender Plus is on a shelf in the garage, and the RV with its battery is parked outside.  This cable runs from the charger to the wall of the garage, down to and thru a vent hole in the wall, then across the driveway, under the RV, then up front to the battery box.  It turned out to be just long enough.  When we leave on a trip, I turn off the charger, then coil the cable beside the garage till we return.  We no longer worry about fast-charging the battery every month or so during the winter to keep it from freezing.I use this to equalize the grey tanks when camping for 4 days or more. In cold weather we take showers in the camper so the grey tank in the bedroom fills up in 4 days.  This lets us divide the grey water from the kitchen with the one in the bedroom.  It also ads a little capacity because it stores water in the pipes down to the valve.  When dumping just take the cap off of this valve, install hose, close both grey valves, open this valve to drain pipes, drain black tank, open both grey tanks again, rinse and done.With this 25 ft extension I can leave the Battery Tender inside the garageand close the door so it's not out in the weather ~nor any concern about the BT coming up missing,and reach my truck battery in the driveway to be sure it starts in the winter.We also keep a car in our one car garage, that is hardy ever driven,so periodically I connect the Batter Tender to the car to maintain that battery too.And the Battery Tender works equally well, with or with-out the 25 ft ex.The total potential lenght combining this cable, with the BT cords are about 38 ft.if continued in a straight line.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord  74" long ~Cable that clips to a battery 84" long ~ totaling over 13 ft.For me the BT extension cable is perfect.I leave my car hooked up for several days ~then add the 25 ft ex and clip to the truck.This extension cable is of good qualityand adds to the versatility of the BT Plus.
I'm not sure how accurate this thing is.  I have a new battery but this will show less than 12V after a few hours with the engine off.  It will, however, show over 14V after the engine is started.  I would assume if it stays consistent that you can tell if there is a problem at some point in the future.  I think this is more useful than the factory gauge.  I would recommend getting this type of voltage meter if your battery is getting old.Bought this charger to replace the rediculous charger that comes with power wheel cars and trucks. Had to do some minor wiring connector swaps, but this charger is soooo much faster and actually let's me know when the battery is done! Terrific charger, I would buy another!!! Can't beat the price and functionality......I think the marine battery to use as a backup for something and I need to keep it fully charged all the time I selected this item to do that for me. It does an excellent job. There is not a whole lot to say about it you just connected to the battery and plug it in and it works. There are no settings buttons or other things to worry about there are just two LEDs that let you know if it is charging or if it is fully charged. I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this item to anybody who wants a good quality battery charger.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.

I have a Yuasa lead acid wet cell battery in my bike, this looks to be a good match for it. The included hook up wiring is good quality, and the unit has a simple to read interface: power on, charging, maintenance mode/trickle charge.Glad that we can purchase a good quality charger for so little money...my BT cost $60.One tip: match the charger to the battery type. Lead acid, AGM, gel, lithium ion, lithium iron phosphate batteries all need specific chargers.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.The best battery disconnect switch I have used. Very positive switch positions. Easy to install. You need a good electric drill - drilling into the steel frame on an RV can be a daunting task.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!
I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose, so I returned it and got this.  A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge "back in the day" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a "dual chuck" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.
Makes seal very slick and shiney should do a great job protecting the rubber seals, dont know how long it will last untill it has to be reapplied, but will let you knowIf you're trying to sleep and it's warm this device will blow a breeze over you and the sound is so smooth it will put you to sleep. High quality construction, totally waterproof when closed.Careful you don't drop the adapters when prying the package open (don't ask).  Product seems to fit well but time will tell.
Loaded with features, including discrete settings for Optima style AGM batteries, and an automatic de-sulfating charge step, a great value for the money.Amazon provides a hard to find cleaning kit for the K&N auto air filters. Directions that come with the kit are a helpful reminder. There is enough Cleaner solvent and Oil for more than one cleaning. so it is an effective way to have clean filter for better fuel mileage w/o having to go out and find an OEM replacementBest price for the money I would get stronger if you have a F250 or F350 made for more of F150 or lower such as Jeeps and Explorers.
Both the stock photo, and the J.Koster JPG you see of this product are no longer valid, and whatyou get is what my JPG shows.The product has been cheapened by shortening the wires by half (now 1 foot)by the time you spread the wires apart enough for the clamps to reach bothterminals on a standard sized 12 volt car battery, you have just taken up halfthe wire length which leaves you 6 inches left over.I have not stripped the insulation of the wires to check gauge, but it can't be anymorethan 18; 16 at the most.While the product does work, you would have to use it right on top of the battery, which isOK for me, as I only use it for test purposes.As far as the whole "Front panel illumination" line, I can't figure out why that is in theproduct blurb!The product comes in a cheap clear plastic bag, NOT A THERMAL FORMED PACK! as is shown, sothe product you see is not the product you get.Again, see my JPG of what you ACTUALLY GET.Due to the low price, it is not worth returning, but you should be aware of these changes.From the moment you touch the package, you'll begin to wonder if this came from a dollar store. It has that knockoff look and feel that you just don't see in mainstream stores.And once you have the "flare" out of the packaging, you'll probably notice how it's about ready to crack before you even screw on the battery cap. You may even notice (or be disturbed by) the similar look this has to a more adult-oriented item.But hey, the box says it's a super-bright LED that's as good as a flare, right? Well, that's not so true. The dopey LED isn't very bright at all. If this is as bright as a flare, then a MagLite is as bright as the sun. I wrote it off to the crazy no-name AAA batteries and tried some fresh Duracells. Same result.But... but... it says it has a map light, too! Indeed, it does. Hopefully, there's nothing red on your map, because the "map light" is that same dopey red LED -- but not blinking. And really, that's something to give some serious thought to. If it was really that bright, would they suggest you use it as a map light? I think not.If anything, I'd think that using this as a road flare is more likely to confuse drivers than warn them. In fact, the only useful application this has that I can think of, is using the loophole to tie it to your kid on Halloween. That is, if you're angry with your kid and want to shame them with something that's not even as bright as a Glow Stick.Paying more than the cost of a candy bar for this is pure insanity.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.
Bought this to fill gear oil for Manual transmission in my Hyundai Elantra. The fill port on the elantra trans is on the fron of the housing and there actually is about 3-4 inches of clearence. The fill tube fit nicely in the hole for the transmission and filling was pretty effortless. My only gripes is as I was filling there was a constant drip from the fill hole and the hose bends easily. So not only is filling slowed down but I lost probably about 1/4 quart of oil down the front of the transmission.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.
I agonized over buying this cover as I wasn't sure it fit. When I recieved it I was relieved that it worked just fine. It took some fiddling to install it, but eventually I got it on. Not we will see if it is unbreakable or not. The original vent cover was literally shredded by hail.I've put this on and axle upside down, it stays where I put it, and so do the bolts, washers, and nutesI love this tire shine, I use it every time I clean the cars. Spray it on, let it set and wipe off the excess. I do not use this as a spray and go or else it will leave a greasy film down the side of the car.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!
this stuff really helps prevent rust on nuts and bolts. i lubed up my brake studs with the permatex anti seize and it lasted through out the whole winter without needing to be re-applied again. i actually apply this on every bolt i have to take out on my car like the struc bolts, tie-rod, axle nut, brake caliper bolts, etc. i dont know how well this would work against exhaust bolts however. the permatex anti seize does say it can tolerate 500 degree F of heat but never had the chance to test that out.I have my daylighters mounted near the side pillars of my pickup and these guards clean up the look nicely. It also cuts down on the glare that shines onto the hood from my mounting location. I cant tell a huge difference on light output, so that is a plus. They lock on so secure that I have actually cut my hand on them trying to get them off. Wont lose them on the trail and its a nice deterrent to anyone looking to walk by and just pull it off to walk off with it.Good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room. I use this on my ATV for the batt charger since I put a basket on it. Don't have to crawl under to hook it up.
No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.
Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended.Want peace of mind?  Use this fluid.  In my cars, I installed after-market transmission pans with extra capacity, cooling fins, and drain plugs.  Look into Mag Hytec pans.  Plan on doing heavy duty work?  Hauling?  Towing?  Imagine sitting at idle in stop & go traffic.  I've also installed aftermarket transmission coolers with their own built-in electric fans.  Amazon carries B&M;, Derale, & Flex-A-Lite.  Keep an eye on that ATF dipstick, and change the fluid as needed.  For those of us that believe you can't do too much maintenance or "over change" your fluids, then draining the pan once a year and topping off with 5-8 quarts is perfect.  Royal Purple is a great product.  It ranks right up there with Red Line, Mobil 1, and Lucas Oil.Differential CoverB&M; 70297 Hi-Tek Cooling System For Engine Oil Or Automatic Transmission FluidFlex-a-lite 4190 Remote 6-Pass Transmission Oil Cooler - 16,000 GVWDerale 13750 Atomic-Cool Remote Oil Coolera must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied.
I always have about 3 packs of JB weld different places in my house because i have found it can be a very good problem fixer. Be sure to use it in applications where your safety will not be compromised. I have recently used it to fix my MTD lawn mower blade adapter. The adapter has a little notch a 1/4" thick that keeps the adapter and blade spinning on the engines crankshaft. after several years of use the notch sheared off, i used JB weld to put it back on with a small amount on the sheared part and a small long bead lengthwise on the sides. The mower is now back in action and saved me from buying a new adapter.I purchased this for a small RV modification. My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.  I have used these before for water hoses, and though it says &#34;electric cable hatch&#34; it will work fine for a standard RV freshwater hose too.I use this battery tender for my Harley Davidson. With the OEM security system, the Harley can drain a battery quickly, making it a hard start on those cool fall mornings. When we are up north at our lake home, the HD does not have a garage to be placed in, so I will use this  battery tender outside and did not trust using the normal battery tender out side with not protection, so I was using a pail to place over the tender. Now I can use this one without worry.Would purchase again.
Bought for my new Corvette.  Chevy sells a similar (if not the same0 product for a much higher price.  The CTEK web site shows this unit brand labeled for BMW, Audi, Maserati and Lamborghini so it may well be the unit Chevy buys brand labeled.It has a 4 mode charging system.  The last is a pulsed maintenance mode so it can be kept on all the time for when the car will not be used for several weeks.  Well-made and comes with a bag to hold it and the accessories, that I put on a pegboard hook in the garage.Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug.This product has been around for over sixty years and is still recommended as a fuel additive. It is more for older models however due to MUCH higher sulfur content. I use it my 1999 Malibu 3.1L V6 all the time as a gas additive. I would not use this as an oil additive though. It is not nearly as effective as more modern ones like Lucas. Use Marvel in your 1999 or earlier vehicle as a fuel additive for happy motoring!
I have a 2001 Silverado with a 5.3 engine. On the 2001, 5.3 engine the Knock sensors sit in deep pockets. Water tends to get down in there sooner or later and that causes the knock sensors to fail. Replace the harness while you are at, as the harness is the seal.Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool!I have a 2005 Suzuki C50 Cruiser (700lbs 93") and this cover does cover the bike without its hard bags attached. It does have multi-bars on it, which to are covered.  The bottom half of both tires are exposed.  I am able to connect the front bungee, but the middle one has to attach to the bike frame, as it will not reach to the hole on the opposite side of the bike.It has been raining for the last couple of days, so I plan to go check it out in a few more days, as it is expected to rain through tomorrow.I will adjust my review if there was any issue with wind and/or upper portion of bike getting wet or dusty despite the cover being in place.For now, I do suggest picking this up, as the price-is-right.
I saw a review on Mojo channel where the reviewer used the MPG display to increase mileage.Based on this I bought one and I'm not disappointed.I can see this easily paying for itself in less than a year.The real time MPG display allows you to tame that lead foot and get awesome mileage on a long run.I did an 8 hour drive last week and must have got conservatively 5MPG better fuel economy. You do have to work at viewing the display and feeding it back to that right foot. Very easy to install - under 5 minutes.If you're not a gadget fan then don't buy it.After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to pick one up as a Christmas present for my elderly parents so they had something on hand to jump start their Honda Accord if it was ever needed.  As of yet, of course, I have not had the opportunity to try it out.  However, I did do a bench test using the 12V adapter plug.I used a 120V converter outlet to plug into where the flashlight is. This enabled me to plug in a lamp.  I was amazed to find that it kept a 40 watt CFL bulb powered for 7 hours!  This unit is perfect for the unexpected power outage.  I wish I had found this unit much earlier on before I bought the Duracell 450 and 300 units.  It is so much lighter, less cumbersome and bulky.  It is also at the fraction of the price than the Duracell Powerpack units.Some side notes:  This unit does not have any indication as to when it is fully charged, other than to look and see that all 3 green lights are lit.  It states in the manual it should be fully charged within 3 hours, but should not be kept plugged in for more than 24 hours.  So, the owner must remain vigilant during the charging process or damage to the battery may occur.The final 3rd remaining green light WILL blink when the unit is low on power.  This is a nice feature so you can prevent depleting the battery to the point of damage.  I am unsure if it has an internal cut off to prevent this from happening, but I do not want to take that risk.There is another variation of this model at a lower price.  It is yellow and I believe it has thicker jumper cables.  I am going to buy one of them next for my own home purposes after Christmas.  If anyone has any feedback on that one, I welcome anyone to leave a comment.  It is appreciated.Be confident, buy this unit!I am not a good mechanic, I don't even pretend to play one on TV. Mostly I am somebody who is sick of paying $80 to the local mechanic to find out the gas cap is cracked or some $10 part needs to be replaced. I finally decided to buy a code scanner to facilitate my repair efforts.---THE GOOD STUFF---* The unit worked right out of the box on both my 2006 Subaru Outback and my 2002 Jeep GC. The hardest part of the whole deal was finding the port on the Subaru. (Tip-look under the hood release).* There seems to be a whole INNOVA website that they want you to go to for help translating the numeric codes into English. So far typing every code I have seen into Google has brought back more information than I know how to use. Not sure how this works for more serious mechanics who might need access to technical bulletins, but for us Saturday morning driveway hackers, it is fine.* The unit seems reasonably well made, although not sure it would stand up to the day-to-day use of a professional. For us "couple times a year" mechanics, it seems fine.---THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF---* There are no directions included, only a CDROM. The CD doesn't even have the directions, but points you to a website. Actually it doesn't even do that, instead it loads an application onto your computer and the app has a link built into it to get you to the website. Kind of convoluted and time wasting.* Plugging the scanner into your USB port kicks off the loading of a driver. No warning, and no idea what it loaded. I hate that.* The box could really do with a quick-start guide. Really all you need to know is how to plug it in, when to power (not start) the vehicle, and what the little buttons do. Would fit on an index card. Instead it is a 15 minute software deal.---SUMMARY---It seems fine for what I want it to do, namely just scan codes quickly. The whole PC/CDROM could have just as soon been skipped. For my use, no reason at all to plug it into the computer, and the installed app just looks like trouble.Ideally a quick-start guide, or better yet, some abbreviated instructions printed on the back, would have made this so much easier for a first time scanner user. That is the reason for the 4 stars and not 5.No idea how robust the unit is, or how long it will last, but I will probably lose it or drop it before it "wears out".
This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it.I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.Very handy to toss in the trunk.  Using this will protect your ciggy lighter socket that could get overloaded.  Every car should have one. I use it for an air pump and a very powerful camp light.Note, most lighter plugs are limited to around 10 amps by fuse or circuit breaker in addition they have long run of small (higher resistance) wire to the jack which 'may' cause a voltage drop to your equipment.Short of 'hard wiring directly' this is the next best thing.This has none of that and of course it's the same as hooking directly to the battery so know what you are doing (sparks, load, polarity, fingers)...You might also want to pick up a heavy duty male to female ciggy plug extension cord...
Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.
I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night. I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights. They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground.We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered.Good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room. I use this on my ATV for the batt charger since I put a basket on it. Don't have to crawl under to hook it up.
Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.This item works very well. It has a really bright L.E.D light and setup is super easy. I think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even UPC number before ordering anywere online. Make sure it says MAXSA on the package and you have the correct one.It is very easy to setup,I measured our car first. Our Infiniti from dash center {were I wanted laser} to the front bumper was about 6ft. I then measured in my garage were I wanted the cars dash to be when I parked witch came out to be approx 9-10 ft from front wall. Thats 6 FT + 3 to 4FT for mower and walking space in front of car.Mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about 3-4 feet in my garage door when it detects it. That way it will light up just before I get to parking location I chose and laser wont stop shining before I park like some reported.My door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser. Its a good sensor IMO. I aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way I have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward,centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine.Since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area, it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error. It seems to work well like this. It took about 15 min total to setup.CAUTION: Wives/husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money. Even when they choose to drive your truck to work everyday because they dont want to pull thier car in/out of the garage before this was installed. This will pass soon as long as you "never" mention it was for them again. NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN!!!!I ordered this for a 2002 mercedes e320. This unit has to be connected to the swi-can to allow the steering wheel functions to work with an aftermarket head unit. The swi-can connects to the can harness and the swi-jack connects to the radio. It was fairly easy to install and the controls of my alpine head unit work from the wheel. I was told by crutchfield that there was no way to utilize the steering wheel controls on the e320 with the alpine radio. I am glad I found out about the swi-can and the swi-jack.The swi-jack was somewhat difficult to program at first. The thing to keep in mind is that the unit has preset functions so you have to either use each one with a button on the wheel, or skip it as the instructions say. There are some YouTube videos showing how to program it, that are helpful.
These wipers do what they are supposed to do... Clear the window of liquid debris.  I would give the wipers about 4 stars cause I have noticed from time to time not the best performance but overall very good.This review actually comes in mostly due to the amazing customer service I received from Valeo.  When I was picking up one of my wiper blades, the plastic piece fell apart rendering the wiper blade utterly useless. I decided to search reviews on amazon to see if anyone else had the problem.  I found another review like mine and that reviewer said that they e-mailed the company and got replacement plastic clips.So I decided to e-mail the company and Watkins Devane replied back with in about 20 minutes.  After supplying my car information and model number of the wiper blade I had issues with, I was sent replacement parts that arrived in about 2 days.  Installed new clip and wiper works great again.Just a tip, if you plan on e-mailing the company with an issue like this, provide your car make, model, and year along with the wiper blade model number to expedite the process.I shopped around on the internet, and Amazon clearly had the lowest price on this battery (50 dollars cheaper than buying in town - even with a coupon).  I was worried, though, after reading about so many issues with the batteries being delivered damaged or smashed.  Not mine.  Mine was in the original Optima box with HUGE styrofoam protectors surrounding the battery.  The box was extra thick cardboard.  Not only that, but UPS delivered the battery and the box was perfect - really - no dents, no signs of being dropped or mishandled.  And, even better yet is the battery was fresh stock - manufactured in the same month and year that I placed the order.  I am a very happy customer on this purchase.  BTW, when the battery arrived I checked it with my DVM and the voltage was about 12.8 VDC.  I installed it and the car cranked right up!  You can check out my video on how to change this battery on a Suzuki Grand Vitara on YouTube at watch?v=ppqJdzyMZxM&list;=UUSZgIbvZItJr78kHY3Y9wnA&index;=5Update:  after just a bit over a year since installation, the negative terminal started leaking acid.  I wrote to Optima and included my Amazon receipt.  Optima notified Amazon directly to issue me a full refund.  I have used and loved Optima batteries for many years, but feel their quality may have suffered when they moved assembly to Mexico.  I have switched to Odyssey.I have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced.  I was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered, but I examined the wiper and it looked ok.  I contacted Valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that I had to deal with the seller (Amazon) for warranty.  Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up.  I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon.  I think Amazon agrees.
I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them)..Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be.Needed something to plug into my 25&#34; camping travel trailer to monitor my 2, 6-volt (connected in series to make one large long lasting 12v battery) batteries .... This thing worked PERFECT! When you turn anything on it register the drop in voltage and just seems to show the correct battery level perfectly at all times. It drops down to yellow when you kick on the heater and what not but that just means it is showing you where the levels are at with that kind of load. Makes monitoring my batteries Simple As Can Be!

How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself.

I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well. I always feel like the trailer is leaning when I walk around in it.With this bullseye level, I can place it on the trailer tongue or on the trailer floor as I do my leveling. I can quickly do the leveling with confidence. When I am done, I slip the bullseye in a drawer where it will be safe for my next trek.I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chocked
This filter fits perfectly and provides much needed outside air filtration. It remains to be seen how well it holds during allergy season.This dries my car very well and stops water spots from forming.It's an oil change pan.Pro: It holds a lot and it bigCon:  Where is the plug for the spout?
Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.it does take a little skill to make sure you dont let it land on any other surface (besides the one your trying to remove 3m from) but honestly it works great. i would recommend this glue remover to anyone who wants to remove decals from there car or remove the glue left over when removed.Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows.
Last thing you want to do is pay for Dynamat and not install good.Leaving air pockets can impact sound / rattles etc.Buy this once and be happy.  Don't get the cheaper one...hear it is worthless.No complain, is working right and perfect. 4 stars cause it should bring a switch to turn on and off and the clam to connect to battery is week it should be stronger .I will update . let's see how long last, I never have one.I was in need of an Air Compressor but I did not want to get one that was huge.  This little guy is pretty small and does the job!  You set your PSI, plug it in and hook up to whatever needs air.  The Air Compressor will stop automatically once it reaches the preset PSI.  It is awesom if it ever breaks down I will be picking up another!
I use it every day and not just for calipers. I use it on battery chargers when I have to charge a battery and have to work underneath the car so it supports the charger on the liftI use this through the season on a couple pieces of power equipment that doesn't get used often and also during winter when I store my batteries indoors (cold climate). Works good and only draws 12 watts while plugged in.If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.
I have been looking for a battery filler for my RV, as it is almost impossible to add water to the batteries any other way.  This baby does the trick in an instant, without over- or under-filling each cell AND no spillage.  Fill it with distilled water, screw on the cap, and the water inside does not evaporate, so it's always ready when your batteries need it.Exactly what it does. Designed to be light weight, affordable, and reliable. Except that it should only be used in emergency situations. Situations where you walk out of a store to realize your car wont start. This will have enough power to jump start these kind of scenarios. It WILL NOT jump start a car thats been sitting for a month and the battery has been drained to nothing. Its not designed to do that. The light in the front is useless and isnt even LED, BUT it doubles as a cigarette lighter type 12v socket to charge up a phone or whatever. Dont lose the charger, it costs half the price of the actual jump box and is a very non standard voltage.Would give it 5 stars, if it had a more standard 2 prong or 3 prong standard wall outlet plug for charging. but overall. its good to have in the trunk for those just in case moments.I purchased this to charge a pair of very large AGM deep cell batteries I have hooked in series.  It took them from near zero to full charge in a bit over 4 hours, topping them off slowly and then automatically shut down... perfect. It's light, easy to use, the cables, clamps and case are robust and should take a lot of use without failure.One other thing of note, if you plug it into a small gas generator, on 4 amp charge it won't even bring the generator off idle. This allows you to charge batteries, and also run household items off the generator at the same time. Perfect for cabin or RV solar systems on rainy cloudy days when the solar panels won't provide enough and no "plug" is available.

Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.After observing that my Radio Shack test leads don't conduct electricity very well, I decided to upgrade to this set. Generally I have been happy with my purchase but the large number of small parts is a concern. Extech provides tiny dust caps for many of the conductive surfaces, which should improve their longevity. While these are a nice touch, they are likely to get lost.  Additionally, the base cables are separate from the probes and clips, creating 12 separate parts.  Adding the slim reach test probes, which would be purchased separately, there will be a total of 14 items in the case.It would take a longer time period to truly evaluate this product as the corrosion resistance of the surfaces along with the durability of the PVC cables will be the key indicators of value. Meanwhile, the cables and probes appear to be well made.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the flared design of the main probes can be less than ideal in tight spaces.  So, you might want to consider purchasing the Extech TL743 Slim Reach Test Probe Set at the same time.  Note the term "set" in the case of the slim reach test probe set is a bit misleading because there are only two probes without case or cables.  They will fit nicely in the existing case.The Extech TL809 Electronic Test Lead Kit is a solid value.  There is some room for improvement, such as integrated caps, but this would most likely come with an increase in expense and some additional limitations.  For no additional expense, Extech should include the slim leads in the base kit and make the flared probes optional.  At this price point, this lead set is highly recommended.ProsNice carrying caseComes with probes, alligator clips and plunger mini-hooksDust caps on conductor surfacesConsToo many small partsFlared test probes too wide for some applicationswhile amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.
I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting. Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70% which is nice and after full charge at 100% the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that's where it stops working like others have reported...came back to the battery after two days and the battery isn't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52%. The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked. It only seems to charge and not maintain so It's being returned to Amazon.Don't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update. Amazon replace charger and was quick about it...but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund. Done with this brand.The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility.I have one permanently connected on my mini-motorhome.  It works great while connected to AC power AND the engine is running.  Whenever I'm hooked up to AC power, the battery is maintained when powered up and not damaged when the engine is running.  I'd surely call this a must have for RV's.
I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.This is perfect to keep my battery charged in my dual battery truck that is used seldomit took over 8 hours to load the batteries as I expected not bad for a 1.25a chargerI have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months.
When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine.Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
One of the best oil filter on the market.Exceed manufacturer's spec.Expensive, but is your car worth it ?This is my 2nd battery tender. I needed another one as I have multiple motorcycles. Best thing you can buy to maintain your battery and the best brand by far. I highly recommend any battery tenderSecond one I have bought... That should tell You this is the best Jeep hitch for the money... Extended is the greatest for trailering with outside spare...  Giddy-Up.
Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youDon't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!
Can not imagine camping in a hook up camping area without this product. Keeps the sewer hose at the proper angle so that tanks drain completely with ease and no sags that would trap waste. Have been using for some time now and have had no problems at all!Light-weight, easy-to-read meter with adjustable head. You can leave it in the electrical socket for constant monitoring or keep it in the tool box or glove compartment for occasional check ups. Highly recommendedI have used this brand/type thread sealer in many applications from intake bolts, head bolts, and even under the water line on hulls. I`ve never had any issues with removing any hardware using this product! recommend it hands down!
I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.This is a great product!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have purchased similar items in the past that did not  perform nearly as well and were not as accurate reading and stable!!You just plug it in to any of your vehicles auxilary power outlets and it lets you know the battery condition with the engine off.  Start the engine and it  lets you know how you alternator is doing by the charging voltage.  It  also has 3 light emitting diodes red, yellow, and green.  Red  (for very low battery or bad battery cell or poor alternator output)  Yellow (for marginal battery charge or low alternator output)and green (for full battery charge and proper alternator output)'It will also give a red if the alternator output voltage is too high or when a battery charger is connected to the battery. It is much more accurate than your gauge on your car unless you have a digital voltmeter in your instrument panel. I use it on all of my vehicles, especially the ones with idiot lights or connect it with an auxilary socked with  alligator clips to the battery of vehicles with no  charge indicator.  It diagnoses problems  relatively quick and  lets you see a problem before you battery goes dead.
this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter.I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too.
I used this on a car put in storage for many months. It started up with no problem. Now I use it in my lawn mower gas year round. I put it in the 2.5 gallon gas can and don't have to worry during the winter.Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.This replaces my previous one of these that just failed after 8 years of good service keeping my summer only vehicles' batteries charged over winter storage. You will likely need to get one or more accessories such as the 12 volt extension cords so you can reach all your vehicles, cigarette lighter plug-in instead of standard battery clips that come with the unit, etc. Highly recommended. Also have the two bank unit that was causing am radio interference on the house circuit, returned it under warranty and they repaired it on a timely basis. I am able to get very long battery life using Battery Tender products.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.
If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.First, this is a great unit and rock solid at brake control.  I upgraded from a Tekonsha Prodigy.  It's Simple!  Just removed the older unit (Prodigy) from it's existing bracket, unplugged the existing wiring plug, plugged in the P-3.  I slid the P-3 into the old bracket and inserted the 2 screws.  It's installed.Then I just adjusted the P-3 per the included operating instructions. It could not have been simpler.Starting from scratch?  About an hours work and the instructions are all there.  Most newer trucks come with a trailer harness for a controller.  My 06 Chev 2500HD did.  However there are instructions for installing it without a dealer supplied harness as well.Highly recommend this unit vs. others if mounted at eye level.  (see "Update Aiain).Update:  This is a great unit.  BUT, other than an LCD screen to provide additional info for the user, the ability to control the braking action is no better/ no worse than the Prodigy I replaced.Update again:  The LCD screen is impossible to read if the unit is mounted low on the dashboard area and/or if you wearing polarized sun glasses.  I switched back to the LED unit which is far easier to see and read.DOWNGRADED TO 4 Stars!
ok, if you read the reviews, you will see lots of "oh the cord is so long, it has to run by the brake pedals, its not 100% accurate" blah blah wah wah. This device simply reads and displays what the vehicles computer is showing. is anything 100% accurate? hardly. but it does a good job. for the people who say its not helping my mpg, are u kidding? this device does not have anything to do with CONTROLLING your mpgs, your FOOT does! the only way this helps is as a reminder that if you drive like an idiot, u use more gas. if u need a computer to tell u that, dont drive! yes the cord routes by the pedals, thats where OBD ports are. not everything in the world can be bluetooth, deal with it. use a little common sense and route the cord. this thing is handy, and works as advertised. only reason im taking a star away, is that it is a little expensive for what it is, however, with my luck, now that ive bought it, the price will drop. overall a great gadget, that can be saved and used on any future vehicles i may buy.EDIT/UPDATE:  after using the gauge a few different ways now, ive found the average mpg very helpful. it really makes you realize the best way to increase mpg. i thought before if i grandma the pedal always it wud help, takes more than that.From the moment you touch the package, you'll begin to wonder if this came from a dollar store. It has that knockoff look and feel that you just don't see in mainstream stores.And once you have the "flare" out of the packaging, you'll probably notice how it's about ready to crack before you even screw on the battery cap. You may even notice (or be disturbed by) the similar look this has to a more adult-oriented item.But hey, the box says it's a super-bright LED that's as good as a flare, right? Well, that's not so true. The dopey LED isn't very bright at all. If this is as bright as a flare, then a MagLite is as bright as the sun. I wrote it off to the crazy no-name AAA batteries and tried some fresh Duracells. Same result.But... but... it says it has a map light, too! Indeed, it does. Hopefully, there's nothing red on your map, because the "map light" is that same dopey red LED -- but not blinking. And really, that's something to give some serious thought to. If it was really that bright, would they suggest you use it as a map light? I think not.If anything, I'd think that using this as a road flare is more likely to confuse drivers than warn them. In fact, the only useful application this has that I can think of, is using the loophole to tie it to your kid on Halloween. That is, if you're angry with your kid and want to shame them with something that's not even as bright as a Glow Stick.Paying more than the cost of a candy bar for this is pure insanity.I was extremely disappointed in this item. Most of the Camco stuff I have is pretty good, but the problem with this meter is the clear plastic face is not static proof.When comparing with my Fluke multimeter, this meter reads about 2VAC high at 120VAC; or about 1.6% off.When you get the meter, it has a piece of protective plastic over the bezel, and just removing it will induce enough static electricity to cause the pointer to change.  And if you brush across the bezel with your finger, you can make it read anywhere from 110V to 130V, because the static electricity affects the needle.Most meters use a plastic bezel that is immune to static, and does not do this. I don't know if the problem is the plastic the manufacturer used or perhaps they failed to treat it with some chemical.Sadly there are not a lot of options for other brands. I like an analog meter in this case as you can see voltage fluctuations a whole lot better than you can with a digital meter.Hopefully over time this meter will lose it's sensitivity to static electricity.
If you have a clear coat scratch, meaning that the clear coat is scratched off and the paint is exposed, then this product is fantastic. It really does work on these types of scratches. If you have a scratch deeper than that, do not bother using this product. Go to the Auto parts store, or the dealer, or on-line and get the exact touch up paint for your vehicle and follow the directions. Good luck - it may never look the same again.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare?  No way.
If you need an air compressor to carry in your car then this may be what you are looking for. I have a 19 year old truck that needed an emergency unit like this. In my opinion this compressor is not good enough for normal home use. It fills tires very slowly, it's noisy and the light is weak. I like that the hose and lighter cable fits into a compartment for storage, along with the nozzle attachments. Because other reviewers had problems with the built-in digital pressure gauge I ignored it and used my own. The housing is cheap plastic so I don't expect this to last too long but yet again it's not very expensive either.Recommended for emergency use.I have used this a couple of time with my Hi-Lift Extreme jack.  Fortunately i have not need to use it for anything important but it is build to last.  it is a great compliment to a wonderful product.A few years ago I purchased a cheaper air compressor here, and it is a very heavy little unit and works well. This unit also works well but is very lightweight for what it is. I'm not sure that the construction will hold up over an extended period of use and hauling.If you were just going to put this in the car trunk in case of emergency, then it would probably work fine, and I'm sure that is the target demographic....casual users and individuals who need to inflate balls, air mattresses, etc. For these buyers, the digital display and light is also a perk for easy use and emergency kits.If you regularly use an air compressor or are a bit rough with your "tools," you might want to take a pass and opt for a unit with meatier construction.
If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.For long term accuracy you will have to screw these to your RV. Or you can buy a carpenters level on Amazon and place it on the Floor of your RV to check it for level.
This is the kind of spark plug gapper / gap tool you should use when gapping Iridium spark plugs. Simply wonderful.What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.
I got this because my battery kept dying on me.  I think I found the source of the problem after I ordered it but this thing will make sure my battery is kept at full charge.  It comes with 0-ring terminals and alligator clips.  The alligator clips are very easy to put on the terminals.  I read somewhere that the 0-rings are for motorcycles and lawn mowers and stuff so I will just keep them for that.  Anyways, I used regular jumper cables to give my battery enough juice to start my car.  No where in the instructions does it say if the vehicle should be on or off while charging.  My best guess was off since it takes almost 2 days for a complete charge and who leaves their car on for that long, and plus you can charge it with the battery out of the car.  So anyways, I made that little charge for my battery to get up and running and disconnected the jumper cables.  This next part is very important.  First you should connect the alligator cables to the quick connect ends on the battery charger.  Then put the alligator clips on the car positive/negetive leads.  Then if you used an extension cord like I did, plug that into a socket.  Now line up the charger end with the extension cord end.  Make sure all your connections are well on, and then connect the extension cord to the battery charger.  If all goes well, like it did with mine, the red light should come on and say Charging.  I read somewhere that if both the green/red lights STAY on, that your battery is completely dead and that you should disconnect the battery right away or it could lead to bad damage.  The red/green lights flash at startup but then it turned to red.  So anyways, now I am waiting for the complete charge to fill up my battery.  It is 3pm now on a Thursday and I will fill in this space with when it completed.  Keep in mind the instructions say to keep this charger as far away from the battery as possible while charging.  I have mine on the ground right in front of the car so that should work just fine.  I wouldn't recommend putting it inside the engine anywhere like the instructions say.  All in all, for the money of this thing, it is definately worth having around.  I wish I knew about this when I had my motorcycle, because that thing died on me every other day and the quick connect on this would have made charging that thing a breeze.  Also with a riding mower that won't start.  I might get a socket end for the cord so it can charge while in the car.  Other people have said this in their reviews and I will see what it's all about.  Good luck charging!Edit:  So the cigarette adapter just makes hooking it up easier, but it still needs to be connected to a DC outlet so I will pass on that.  Also, I found out that the unit gets very very hot.  I had it on for like 4 hours and touched it and it almost burned me.  Being close to 90 degrees outside couldn't have helped much either, but just be careful.Edit:  So my battery is fully charged now.  It took about a day to charge the whole thing.  Not bad for a device of this size to charge a full battery that was dead at once.  Very good item, I highly recommend it.I planned on using this unit to charge my auto batteries and then leave it on trickle charge. However, it has a FAN which constantly runs and will wear out, just like the fans in the PC's do. I don't know, but I also bet that if the fan bearings fail and the blades won't spin, the charger microprocessor will not operate for safety reasons. Really poor product design to use up fan life when you want to trickle charge a battery over the winter.Never lost a battery to winter low temperatures/forgetting to charge it since I got this.  I peer thru a garage door window occasionally to check that it's little LED light is green, and that's it.  I chose this brand because it doesn't drain your battery if the power goes off.  We have power outages here from time to time, and our old wiring has had some bad connections show up in our house's history, so I didn't want that worry.Chose the Plus model because I'm using it on a size 27 or 29 (can't recall which) deep cycle battery.  It took a long while charging when the battery was 50% discharged, but it does do it - no need to fast charge the battery first with another charger.
this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter.This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket.This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price.
I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle.  I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck (2 batteries).  It seems to work great so far.  I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you.  The Junior's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room.  The Plus' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable.  They apparently don't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way, the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours.  They are new batteries and the truck's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday.  However, there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite.  Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert, the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead.  It is not designed to.  Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need.  I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter.  By spec, the Battery Tender Plus cannot recharge these large batteries from dead.  Again, know what you need.  The tech folks at Deltran can help you with that.These are great units but if you are going to attach the quick disconnect to a modern automotive battery installed in an auto, think twice.  Newer battery cables do NOT allow these rings to attach to the battery at the battery posts.  You'll have to connect the 'Rings' to another positive and negative terminal location.If using on an auto, a better option is the cigarette lighter/power plug unit. (...)Quality of the unit is very good.  4 stars because they don't say, will not work on all battery's.  Also, the rings are not large enough to accomodate an automotive battery cable post attachment.  The holes must be enlarger unless you are attached to other than the atcual battery10/2/2011  Update:  Three years later and the unit has run 24/7 all that time and still going great.  Change to 5 stars +3/3/2013 Update:  The unit has been running constantly for 4 years plus.  Still working just fine.If you have vehicles that you only run half the year- a motorcycle, or a snowmobile, or a large outboard- it's important to keep the battery charged during the rest of the year, or it'll self-discharge and eventually self-destruct. The best way to keep that battery fresh is to bring it indoors and connect an intelligent trickle charger that'll keep it topped off without overcharging. I have a constantly changing collection of small motorcycles and scooters in my garage and a marine battery that gets used occasionally to run a trolling motor, and to go with them, a small collection of these battery tenders in both 6 and 12 volt models. They're not terribly expensive, and they work. You can also buy multi-charge models like theBattery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Chargerthat will handle from two to as many as ten batteries at once, and if you do have more than one battery to maintain, they'e a better deal, and the higher end models are also regulated and temperature controlled. If I was starting from zero that's the way I'd go, but I started with just one, and they're all still working, so I have no need to upgrade.
We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered.After I got my CV from the auction, I ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it. They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined "top," and a vague "bottom." Some bulbs have a kind of a "z" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an "industry rule of thumb," not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a "real" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO "NOT" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on "low beam," then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of "the rule." I have found on my car that aligning the "top" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the "driver's side" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to "play it by ear" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be "self-aiming" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly. Safe driving!These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***
I purchased this back in 1992 for my Oldsmobile and have used it on every car since: Accord, Civic, Integra, GTI, 240SX, 200SX, Maxima, Sentra and I could go on... You name it and it works. If you have a super wide filter or really tight space where the ratchet attaches, it may not be ideal. In my opinion, it's worked on 95% of the vehicles I've owned and this tool is awesome!I have a Battery Tender recharger, and with the extension cable I can leave the charger plugged in a one location and just switch the cable to charge my pickup and a couple of motorcycles ( I have a quick disconnect setup on the vehicle batteries).This isn't  really an essential item, since I have used an extension cord and battery clamps for years, but it is handier, more convenient, and makes the charging process simpler.I have a custom-built trailer with built-in battery to power emergency lights that I tow behind a motorcycle; it's been fitted with a harness so that, hooked to a 117VAC outlet, either the internal U1P-7 battery or the motorcycle battery can be charged. The trailer was originally fitted with a charger which I had very little confidence in; I've substituted the Battery Tender Junior which both frees up space (it's much smaller, about 40% the size of the original) and gives me some confidence that neither of the batteries will be "cooked" by overcharging. The Battery Tender Juniors have a deserved reputation for reliability and durability; battery-charge cycle tests over the past 24 hours have confirmed my opinion that the Junior is the right choice for this application. I do wish that the manufacturer had provided a way to anchor it to a wall or floor so that I need not concern myself with making sure that it's properly mated to the outlet before I begin the charging cycles, but I can live with that small shortcoming.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Headline says it all.  I use it to pump up a water well pressure tank from a 12 v battery using a small portable air compressor.This stuff works. Had a flat in the middle of no where and this got me back on the trail. Works simply. You will need a valve core removal tool and a air compressor. I purchased a &#34;KIT&#34; that has everything you need. Purchased this bottle of &#34;Slime&#34; so incase I get another flat, I will have some. Just a heads up, this is meant at a temporary fix to get you to a repair place. Will last a while.
I am sure this will work fine next fall when I put the bikes to sleep for the winter. I borrowed a can of fogger from a friend of mine for this winter.Had a gimmick NFL thing for the window in my car. Had to plug it in to the car 12v to use it. Dogs wanted to play with the cord. Ran across this on Amazon and bought it. Surprisingly enough the dogs don't play with this! This works very well for what I bought it for. I do recommend this!I used this item for filling the transmission on my 2008 WRX and on my Fiancee's 2007 cobalt.  People that say the hose is to short go to lowes or home depot and get a longer one.
Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard.I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer.  Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure.  That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex.  This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again.you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech.
This is the Cadillac of battery chargers.  I put my Miata on the charger each winter.  Doesn't overcharge the battery, doesn't dry out the cells, just works perfectly.  It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.  At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.  A new battery is about $100.  Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.  Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one.First of all, the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car's motor. Secondly, the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable.It is a battery in a box that will help you jump start vehicles.  Love the plug and leave it charging.  This unit, at least the one I got, has the built in self charger that will not allow over charging of the battery.  I also like the fact it does not have all the gadgets the other unit out there have.  They filled the space in this unit with a bigger battery!!
Be advised, this bit is 3 and 1/2 inches long. Description says 5.7 inches long which is NOT correct.  Did not work with my air hammer. Its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release. So will have to return and get a longer one.How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?
I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup.Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car!This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.
Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.
I don't think this would deter someone who really wanted to steal your trailer for too long, but they would have to make some noise to remove it.  This is just a personal opinion.  We store our trailer at a storage facility where you have to have a key card to get in the fence, so I feel this is adequate.  There are plenty of other trailers in there with no lock that look nice enough that I would think a thief would go for those.  I haven't tried to forcefully remove the lock, so I might be surprised at its actual security.I orig purchased this for use on my Honda cruiser, which didn't work well with the the Kuryakyn gripsKuryakyn 6340 Black Universal ISO-Grip for 1" Handlebarwhich didn't work due to the cramp buster tightening the rubber and making it over grip the throttle sleeve. It would not decelerate as soon as I would let off the throttle.I have recently added a sportbike to the stable and it is REALLY nice having it now.There is a comment about getting it in the right spot, and understanding that was is positioned correctly at 60mph may interfere with accessing the brake lever when you let off the throttle. This is something you should consider before using on a cruiser. On the sportbike I have no issues once so ever. It is nice as I can keep throttle applied without any fingers touching the throttle itself, using just my palm to keep pressure on the CrampbBuster.So it is REALLY nice to have, I still wish I had a throttle lock. But, it does help and is 4 star worthy. But at 8 bucks I'm going to give it 5 stars, I honestly can't expect an 8 dollar product to provide the same comfort as a 60 dollar one.Installed this yesterday. It is a great low tech solution to placing vehicle at exactly the same place every time. I looked at several other options using radio frequencies and lasers. Decided on this option, nothing to go wrong.Others complained of movement of the parking mat. I have not had this installed long enough to evaluate performance concerning slippage. I did carefully clean the area with a powerful solvent before installation as garage floors are likely to have an oily coating. I will update this posting later as necessary.2/17/14I have epoxy paint on my garage floor which could result in the sticky stuff not working. After carefully cleaning the area with a good solvent the mat has not moved. I even hit the rear stop hard to see if it would move. The wife loves it. Highly recommended if installed properly.3/16/14Still exactly where I put it without using any thing other than the supplied double stick tape. Cleaning the installation area carefully is critical. I used lacquer thinner.
Nice fit, need after market aluminum hood latch from rugged ridge to eliminate hood shimmer from wind at high speeds (highway)An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.Works good, installed on my 2012 Kaw Voyager 1700. I installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box. Use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work, sound awesome too.
Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
Looks exactly like OEM and fits exactly like OEM. The price is almost unbeatable. From what I hear FRAM is one of the OEM's for the 2010+ Mazda3, so I went off internet rumors and bought one of these.These bulbs are a nice improvement over the factory bulbs in my 2001 Chevy Silverado pickup.  Installation was easy.  The bright white light looks a lot better than the yellowish lights from the factory which adds a little pizzaz to my pickup.  I subsequently bought some for our 1998 Toyota Avalon and the wife was shocked at how much better she could see at night driving home.  Great bulbs!It has enhanced the night driving experience.  I replaced the 2007 Odyssey with this new set of bulbs.  It is bright and legal.  I tried the silver star but it wasn't brighter so I returned it.  Definitely buy it here on Amazon.  Autozone is selling at retail which is $49.99.  For the price there, you can buy 2 sets here with change left over.I also got the 9005 for the high beam for my 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid.  But I used installed HID kit for my Civic instead and not use the 9006.  But I actually think for budget minded people, this set of Ultra 9006 looks better than the Xentec HID I got.  For $22, you can't go wrong with this.  Buy it and you'll be glad you did.
This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Awesome. You could run a regular (probably orange) extension cord through your garage and then have your battery tender plugged into it on the floor and trip over it constantly or you could buy one of these extensions made for the tender and have it run along your ceiling inconspicuously or run along the baseboard of a wall out of sight and then have it come up right where you need it for your car, truck or motorcycle.handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer.

Worked perfectly.The door catches on a toy hauler will wear out over time, whether from sun damage or excessive use, etc. These are a great thing to have on hand for the times this happens. Easy, two screw install...should fit directly over the existing door catch holes on most RV's.
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back.This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove!I have used Stant locking caps for years on all my vehicles. This does fit a 2004 Ranger fine but the tether that keeps the gas cap attached to the truck will not work without modifications. There is no slot!........ I  removed the retaining ring on the bottom to see if I could modify it by trimming it down but if you trim it you will remove the ability to keep the ring attached.I ended up trimming the inside of my tether and slipping it over the top of the cap then super gluing a piece of electrical wire around the perimeter as a retainer. It's a lot of hassle to do but I didn't want to use it without the tether.One good thing, I was able to see just how they designed the locking mechanism in these. It is a engineering feat just short of genius, but it is not something that I really needed to know about.Anyways, it works as it should but only time will tell if it throws the check engine light due to a poor seal as some reviewers have stated on here. If it does then I will update my review.Some reviewers received 10510 caps with tether slots and some did not, which leads me to believe Stant must have made a new injection mold die but didn't provide any tether gap in it.Edit 11-12-2013: No problems with check engine light, it's a good seal.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.
All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change.This is a factory ScanGauge Cable. I bought it to more easily transfer my ScanGauge from different vehicles so I wouldn't have to take down my already routed cable in my primary vehicle. Great value. Cheapest price I could find online unless you want to make your own cable.Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be.
Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
Great replacement for a rearview mirror. Big for a large car perfect size. I dont know how night mode works or whatever but for sure its just a normal rearview mirrorsGood for filling in areas when doing custom work or doing body work to a damaged area. It's a &#34;pint can&#34; but only has 14oz in it so it was only enough for a smaller project.match my existing wheel chocks.  A little too big a radius on the curved side for my wheels, otherwise would be a 5-star.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.

This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.
I used this to shine up the plastic on my vehicle the past several years I had it.  When I traded it in, every dealer who looked at it said the nearly 10 y/o vehicle looked like new and asked me how I kept it looking so good.  This was in my bag of secrets.  Messy for tires.  Fantastic for plastic molding, bumper guard, mud flaps, etc.I used to take my car to the mechanics and they would hook it up to their diagnostic machine. If they diagnosed my car and I didn't use their services, the fee was $50. Otherwise, if I used their services it was a free diagnostic but I had to pay for the repair. Now I can self-diagnose my car and instantly know what is wrong with it before shopping around for the repair. I used the Actron CP9135 today when my air conditioner was not blowing at all. I had forgotten that I purchased this a month ago and I called my husband to ask him if I should take the car to our mechanic. He told me to go home and hook this up and see if it can tell me what is wrong with the air. After a dozen or so tries to get the air on, I went inside and got the Actron CP9135 and hooked it up. I then turned the car on and the air worked fine and no error codes were reported. I am not sure if this is true, but my husband said maybe it reset the cars computer? Who knows, but it did save me a trip to the mechanic and it gives me peace of mind to know what is going on with the car. I am going to keep it in the glove compartment for future problems.Update Dec 20, 2007: My car was shuddering a bit at low speeds and stops. I immediately plugged this in and found out that my 6th cylinder spark plus was not firing. Took it to the mechanic and had my spark plugs replaced. Saved $109 off the dealers "diagnosis fee"!POWERFULI have a full sized 4wd pickup truck 5.7 L V8 engine.  When the battery went dead over at my parents house their jumper cables from their car wouldn't give enough juice to start my truck.  My dad put his charger on my battery overnight but still the truck wouldn't start.All the technical diagnostic advice I got from everyone was wonderful but I know what a dead battery is and I was sure that was the problem.Since I left my JNC jump box in my other vehicle I came back the next day and said let's give it a try with my &#34;jump box&#34;.  Needless to say it fired right up.The battery was truly dead and would not take a charge whatsoever.Jumper cables from another &#34;smaller&#34; vehicle would not supply enough cranking amps to start my truck... but the JNC had power to spare.I have used it several times over the past year and a half since I made my purchase.  It has not failed me.  I have used it to start my lawn mower, my tractor, my neighbors car, and even some stranger in the parking lot.
Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.Good Meter, it does what it says it does. Good for small and large projects. For the price you can't beat what it does. It comes with a hand strap on back, instructions, the two tips and batteries. Has a battery indicator too. Can't go wrong with the price!! You could go buy something more fancy or brand name but money is stretched nowadays isn't.How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RVI use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.
Exact fit for a '98 Nissan Frontier.  I have used Purolator in the past and I have no doubts that the pureone will exceed the requirements of my car.  -1 star because I feel that the metal casing is a little thin, it flexed pretty easily when I gripped it to installI have had this cap wrench for 20 years, I first bought it for my 1993 Tercel. It worked on the metal canister oil filters of the Tercel and it also works on my 2012 Camry 4 cyl as well. I cannot understand the large number of reviews stating that this wrench broke - how tight are the oil filters they are removing??? I cannot imagine this one breaking if the oil filter is installed properly. The only complaint I have is it sticks to the filter housing (both the metal filter of the 1993 Tercel and plastic housing on the 2012 Camry) so you have to rock it back and forth with your ratchet to get it off.This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderCan't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.

The Battery Tender Ring Terminal Harness is very handy for charging a battery that is not easily accessible.  It allows you to install the ring terminal harness on the battery terminals once, and then just plug the extension cable into it when needing to charge or maintain the battery.The length of the harness cable to the quick-disconnect feature is adequate for easy access when needing to plug into the battery charger without having to disassemble anything on the vehicle once it is installed.  The dust cover provides protection to the quick-disconnect terminals and it keeps them from getting dirty, or wet when you are riding, driving, or boating.The Ring Terminal Harness is a very handy item for being able to quickly connect or disconnect the battery charger.This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.
I bought this hitch ball as recommended by Amazon's "buy it together". The draw bar I ordered has a 1" ball mount and the 72802 is a 3/4" ball mount. Now I need to buy a bushing to make it fit. So much on trying to save a buck.The interlock does not work well with the 72802 as the base is too small.It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper. Easy to use and sturdy. Is not a eyesore, and seems well made, i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest, it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire, but when the thief see's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel, it won't be so much a snatch and grab. Some piece of mind to myself. I run 31.10.50 x 15&#34; wheels (over $350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $1750), with a Smitybilt tire carrier, the 36&#34; cable was plenty long enough.i have a jeep XJ cherokee with about 6" of lift and 33" tires.  I have a 48" hi-lift jack.  I got the smaller one mainly b/c of space as i wanted it to fit under my rear seat in my jeep.  With the 48" i can use my front bumper or my rocker rails as jack points, however it would be pretty difficult to get a tire off the ground unless i maxed out the jack.  This item helps a lot to raise the wheel off the ground and be able to put something underneath the wheel for better traction like a log or rock.  My only small complaint is that there is a nut that holds this onto your hi-lift.  would be better if the nut was a bit longer and that it came with a wing nut instead of a lock nut.  Otherwise the build quality is very good, it has a rubber pad that goes up against the tire.  The hooks are extremely strong and the straps are stitched very very well.

I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.
I replaced a rear sensor in a 1999 camry 4 cyl with this sensor to eliminate a check engine light failure.  It was easier than using an identical replacement because the cable ran through the floor pan under the driver's seat.  By using this I just cut the wires underneath the car, spliced them with included splices and heat shrink and added a layer of self-sealing rubber tape to protect and waterproof the splices.  No more check engine light for about $30.Update: Replaced the rear sensor on my 1998 camry also with perfect success - they went bad on both cars at around 120000 miles.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.Used part of it on my 2012 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI.  Great design - the twist shut off valve is a very practical feature.  Took off the very tip of the funnel (and put the rest aside) and attached it to a plastic hose that I had attached to a 2-gallon Home Depot pump sprayer.  Tip fit perfectly over the hole in the transmission filter housing and into the plastic hose.  Was able to pump in 6 liters in MUCH less time (and no mess) and use the &#34;snorkel&#34; or standpipe to drain off the excess, after running the DSG through the gears and getting temp up to about 40c.  Pumping in 6 liters dilutes and flushes out the dirty fluid caught up in the fluid cooler, the transmission body and the shifting channels.  Result:  a much better DSG service than the dealer provides.
I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with 33&#34; tires that I just bought last year. I drive it around the 'burbs 99.999% of the time, so obviously I need a Hi-Lift X-Treme Jack and accessories to go with it the other 0.001% of the time.For my application, this works great. It's solid and looks cool.I've had this buddy with me in all my roadtrips and I need no other tire gauge with me. I use this on snow/sand trails with me even though my compressor has its own built in gauge, I still use this for a second reading. I wish they had 1 psi increments though.I drive a CLS 550 AMG Mercedes which is high maintenance.  Once a month I flush my tank out with this.  If I have any left over I put it in my brother's truck.  Both vehicles run like champs.  I notice a significant performance increase when the gas has the Techron in it.  Not just for high performance vehicles, but any vehicle can benefit from being cleaned and flushed with this product.  If you don't think so, buy a bottle and prove me wrong (unless your vehicle doesn't have an engine, then I'm wrong).  :)
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletI required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.does what its supposed to do. it carry's gas from the tank to the hose then on to the rv.
You only need a few things to get your home detailing kit started and the Grit Guard is at the top of the list. If you are doing a 2-bucket wash then Grit Guards are 100% necessary. No questions asked.For those that do not know what a Grit Guard is, this little device sits on the bottom of your wash/rinse buckets and allows dirt and sediment to drop into the bottom of your bucket. After you wash a panel you rinse your wash mitt in the RINSE bucket and rub the mitt along the Grit Guard on the bottom. This helps knock dirt out of the mitt so you can have a clean mitt to wash the next panel of the car. The little fins on the bottom of the Girt Guard help keep the water from swirling and disturbing the dirt that has settled on the bottom of the bucket.Necessary Items for Home Car Wash:1. 2 Buckets2. 2 Grit Guards3. Microfiber Wash Mitt (I recommend 2 - one for top panels, one for bottom)4. Car Wash SoapThese basic supplied can get you started. Once you get a basic wash kit then I guarantee you will want to expand and look into microfiber towels, waffle weave drying towels, clay bar kit, wax, etc.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.

Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.My husband installed these on his 97 Cherokee in just 10 minutes.  Remove 2 bolts on top of each lift support and place a screwdriver under the spring clip on bottom and the ball joint connection on the lower end slips right on.Trunk now stays up and doesn't hit him in his head! Worth the time and money for sure.Be sure to support the trunk with a 2x4 or long broom handle before removing old lifts. Save the bolts because there are no bolts provided with the new lifts.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it.32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus.This cover fits my bike well and is very durable.  The generous size makes it easy to cover and remove, yet it has a snug fit as necessary to handle the wind.  Good product!
Here's a little hint: EVERY SCION xA & xB can use a cabin filter, and it is a great upgrade to make. It doesn't matter if it came with the option from the factory: every HVAC unit comes with the filter tray. All you have to do is install it.There is only one thing I require for a cabin air filter, and that's the absence of cow dung particulate when traveling along the Central California section of I-5 when it's 110 degrees and hasn't rained in four months.From personal experience, this filter delivers the goods at a great price. It fits the carrier tray perfectly, just make sure you lock the filter's lip into all the tray's plastic snaps. It'll click, so it doesn't require much brain power.This does indeed store plastic bags - a few. It is small enough to fit on the inside of cabinet doors on my RV but it really doesn't hold many bags and leads to the obvious question - &#34;Why spend the money?&#34;. However it does work as advertised.Hi All.There is not a whole lot you can say about a "Plastic Bag Holder"  It does do as it says it does, and that is a place to stroe your Plastic Bags in your RV.  Its neat and orderly to use.  Only real issues, is look at the size of your RV's Cabinet Doors and measure before you do buy this Plastic Bag Holder.  It is made very well for what it is.  Its a very Heavy Duty Plastic made holder.  I was a little surprized at the size of it.  I too, should have measured.  But it did work out for us, as we have faily large Cabint Doors in our Motorhome.  You could also mount it inside of a Cabinet or on a Closet Wall, out of the way also.  And it does hold a fair amount of Plastic bags, for later use.  Happy Travels.
It's sta-bil how can it be wrong and this is the best price I could find. I am very happy.Although it should be included for free with the Jack this item is a must have and reasonably priced.  Careful it's also easily stolen.A must have item, but use care as this can break (and still be usable).I would not be without one.
I wish this had a swivel head and light. It is much lighter than the models that do, however, so this one rides in the saddlebag and the others are on the shop wall. I've compared accuracy with more expensive units and thus one reads the same every time.Theres not that much to say. I enjoy the high quality of the Mobil1 filter, and I use Mobil1 synthetic in my 2011 Jeep Wrangler JK. This filter fits perfectly because it is the same as the M1-102 (which I think is the number of the stock size) except this one is about 30% longer, which means it has more filter area so it can handle more dirt and grime. I would be okay changing the filter only every other oil change with a larger filter like this and high quality oil, but I do change it every time anyway. This price can't be beat.I personally think that there are better options available in this price range. I like the Griot's Garage MF Chenille wash mitts better than this Meguiar's Wash Mitt.This mitt feels much cheaper and I have demoted this to assisting on the wheels or very dirty bottom panels (where I do not want to use a higher quality mitt).
When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine.So easy to use and turn on and off. It dose not burn your hand like the others do when left out in the sun.Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.
This thing really cleans what you do not expect do get cleaned and even with ease. Try it and you'll know what I'm talking about.Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL
If you are searching for a good, high-quality wheel cleaner, look no further! Not only is it pH balanced to ensure that you don't damage the finish of various wheels you may clean, its cleaning power is second to none. If you have a vehicle that generates a lot of brake dust (BMW, namely, but other vehicles that have fade-resistant brakes), you can spray P21S on the wheel wipe around with the provided sponge let sit for a few minutes and spray off and they'll look good as new. I occasionally (~50k miles) take off the wheels and clean the caked on stuff on the inside of the rim, too. It takes a bit more scrubbing but cleans it to make it look new every time. If you can't get this stuff to take whatever you have on your wheel, you will likely need to refinish the wheel - this stuff is the very best!You only need a few things to get your home detailing kit started and the Grit Guard is at the top of the list.

Once you get a basic wash kit then I guarantee you will want to expand and look into microfiber towels, waffle weave drying towels, clay bar kit, wax, etc.This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.
There are two (2) 50 gram bars in the package but there is enough clays on each bar that I cut them in halves & used the halves without any problem.Water hardness makes a noticeable difference. If you have hard ground water like I do, my advice is to spend the few extra bucks to wash & clay your car in a self car wash where the water is softened or deionized.Other wise you will not reap the full benefit of claying a car as you are just grinding the paint with microscopic mineral deposits.Use water as lubricant, do not leave any soap on the paint & use the suds as lubricant as the chemical in soap will quickly break down the clay bar itself. You will find the clay "disintergrate" after 1-2 car washes if you rely on soap as lubricant.You only need a few things to get your home detailing kit started and the Grit Guard is at the top of the list.

It is super soft and will not leave any scratches on the car. You can also rinse out almost all the water in it by squeezing it so drying it after is pretty fast too (though I recommend machine washing it after you use it to keep it clean, you don't want to use a dirty mitt to wash your car).
If your interior is already cleaned, don't use it.  It will leave lots of lint on your dash.  I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free.  So I got this from Amazon with other car care products.  I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected.  After  a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash.  So I wanted to start using this duster.  After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel.  I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should "Pick UP" dust instead of leaving "LINT"?  Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again....I own a nearly 20 year old Ford Bronco and one thing that I have learned the hard way is, just about every other nut/bolt that I have tried to remove is seized up.  I have taken apart/repaired/put back together many parts on my truck as I am doing a partial restore and prior to putting anything back together I use this stuff religiously.Actually, last year I put some anti seize lube on a bolt that was previously seized for my headlight housing that required a thorough soaking of pb and a ratchet & vise grip combo to remove and just removed it again yesterday and it came off with so much ease I was scared that it was just doing a free spin again (which it wasn't).I have only been using this product for a year now and I only started because it got such rave reviews and I can safely say that I will never go without having this extremely valuable product in my garage.  It almost makes me want to take out every single bolt/screw, give it a coating, and replace it now before it's too late.  I've had to cut/torch so many bolts and have lost so many hours of my life on what should have been simple 20 minute jobs that I wish that these auto manufacturers treated all of the bolts/screws/nuts with this product upon assembly.Yeah, this stuff gets messy, get enough on your hands and you sort of start to look like tin man, but it gives my wife a reason to run away from me when I threaten to smudge her up.I'm not a professional and I haven't spent a lot of time detailing my car, but I did some research and wanted to get the best feel and look for my car and tried this product. I've heard everyone talk about the clay and I really don't know the difference, but that may be simply that I am new to detailing my car. Anyway, it took the contaminants off my car and make it as smooth as glass. I can tell from using it that it was smoothing out the surface of the car in seconds! And it was fun! I took the time and did my car in less than an hour and it's look great ever since.
What can I say it's an air filter for a car, it fit and came in a box.  Nuff saidFits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.I own a black car in the northwest, so let's just say I know a thing or two about cleaning a car. You'd be amazed at how much dirt and sand gets trapped below these in a bucket. These fit a standard 5-Gallon bucket perfectly; Lowes or Home Depot buckets work just fine. This is definitely a must have item for anyone who washes their own car and wants to keep the finish clean and swirl free.
Man, you want these if for nothing else they pack down in the RV very small. Quick to adjust up or down before twisting the wings.This was the lowest priced creeper seat w/ prime available.  After a while the cushion flattens out and ur butt gets a little sore.  But i cant complain. I could put an extra pad on there.  I really liket his because i have been sitting on milk crates and i leave tools everywhere.  Now when i use tools i just toss it under me and i can keep track of them better.They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Will it work? YesMaybe a squeeze bottle would be better as bottle is not always being stored upright.Area needs to be free of grease.Works well if you have the right application...makes sure you can &#34;use&#34; it based on where your filter is otherwise it may not be as handy...
You can't go wrong with these and should place them on all vehicle battery terminals after cleaning them. They are very easy to apply; red on positive, green on negative, between the battery and the terminal, on the post. Do this quickly as the car computer may require reprogramming if you do it too slow; if that happens it is easy to reprogram, just read your owners manual (it can alter window and door lock function). Before you start blow across the vents to dissipate and vapors that could explode with sparking, wear protective glasses and protective clothes (long sleeves) and wash your hands after.  The liquid in the cells is very acidic and will eat through clothes and skin. This is a good time to add distilled water to the vent holes. Do not top them off but bring the level to the bottom of the venting ring; leave space to vent the gases, there is a slot. Close the cell caps. Use a wire brush on dirty or corroded or fuzzy (usually a white or green powder) terminals and connectors.  Check your electrolyte, if you know how, to see if your battery is weak or has low/bad cells. If you have a lot of corrosion, cap the vents and mix about a tsp. of baking soda in a glass of water and brush it on with a toothbrush (if you get any in a cell it will kill the battery), it will foam up if there is acid, then rinse and dry before placing the washers and terminals. Remove the ground first, place the felt washer, replace the terminal, then place the positive. Reset your clock and anything with memory (GPS). Prepare for winter. If your battery is past the expiration date, replace it so you don't get stuck somewhere. Most good batteries do not live past their expiration date and can't be relied upon. Walmart and Costco batteries seem to be the most reliable according to reviews.This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard.
These are lightweight universal mats--nothing special.  I use them on top of the OEM mats in my car to protect the OEM mats.These are good wiper blade replacements.  They are all metal, fit, and work well. I've tried teflon coated blades in the past and found that the leave some smears on the windshield (probably due to the coating).these work like a charm; the claimed &#34;best&#34; by a consumer publication is correct, these are the best wipers i have ever owned, easy install and great on the highway in heavy rain
I've used Bosch wipers before after learning about them from a commercial during the Storm Chasers series on TV where they chase down storms. I figured they are good enough for people chasing tornadoes I would give them a shot. I've gone through a few pairs of these and never am disappointed. They do a phenomenal job of clearing the rain off of the window and are built well to last longer then typical blades I used to get from the big box stores that were cheaper. Now I will say you can buy a typical set of blades for about half the cost of a pair of these since these are sold in single packs, but the quality really makes a difference with these. I will add, I am also a member of the SKYWARN Storm Spotter community and also use these (different model) on my truck when I'm out hunting down storms.The people complaining about size on here I'm not sure if they choose the wrong model for their vehicle but in my experience as long as you choose the right vehicle it will tell you exactly what you need. In my case it went from year down to trim style and picked the exact blades I've bought before, so make sure you choose exactly the right details and you shouldn't have any issues getting the right size.Go ahead and price out some fuses at the local big box stores or auto parts.  For just a few you would pay $5 to $10.  You get 150 for that here.  For most people, you would never have to buy fuses again.  I'm a mechanic and electrical is my specialty.  I have equipment, knowledge and experience that keeps me from using a bunch of fuses.  However, unit come in all of the time missing and or have multiple blown fuses, so I do go through a lot of them.  These fuses work just fine.If you look around in Automotive stores you see these at $49 and some like Autozone give you a mail in rebate for $10 that takes two months to get back if you get a responseThese are the brightest and best light distribution from all the tens of selections of ugly blue, &#34;white&#34;, wobbling filaments and short-lived bulbs.I highly recommend these and at this price I bought 4 sets for the price of two sets and cannot be happier
I chose 5 stars because of the quality of the product. It is durable and the welds are clean. I do recommend buying these Hein-Werner jack stands because they are made in the USA. The price may be high but again, would you risk your life for cheaper stands? It may also be the type of steal and materials this company uses that makes this product expensive but worth the price.Threadlocker is pretty difficult to rate.  There are many different manufacturers of Threadlocker and each company produces a variety of different strengths.  This specific product I feels does the job admirably.  I used it on the bolts for my Harley.  Have not noticed and &#34;loose&#34; bolts after applying this product.  Harley's vibrate a lot so this product seems to work.I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.
I had mixed feeling about this stuff. I sprayed it on rubber seal as directed ( can says very little about product or direction) It foams on the turns to a liquid . Then it starts to run and drip on RV and eventually dries. It did not stain Rv but it was messy as foam turned to liquid.It works like any spray on tire shine on the market you spray on tires. In fact that's what I did with what was left over with 2/3 a can left used it on tires. It went on the turned to liquid and dried to a nice shinny, non sticky clear coating on the RV tires and my cars. I don't know if it will hold up as long or maybe longer then the tire spray I can buy for 4 .00 a can verse this stuff at 12.00 only time will tell. It claims that it has UV inhibitors so that's a good thing to keep tires on RV from cracking from sun. If it lasts a long time on tires then this will last even longer on  rubber seals on Rv and I will change it to  5 stars, But time will only tell!I am hopping it eliminates that annoying rubber squeaking on slide out  when the motorhome is driving down the road and is why I tried it anyway.This is a fantastic cleaner for all kinds of dirt. I used it on the painted sheetrock wall where the kids run their hands along it while going down the stairs. You know the kind of dirt that is? It got all that off and did not ruin the finish of the paint. Another example is the grease stain on our synthetic porch floorboards came right off and did not damage that material either.This is a cleaner wax that gets the job done. It leaves a great shine and als gets rid on small stuff that the car get on it while driving and it doesn't look like if effects the paint or scratches it.
Most products I've tried have left the nasty white streaks on my windshield when I turn on my wipers.  Not this stuff.  I actually added it to RainX Bug Wash the first time.  Then I added it to plain water when I ran the bug wash out.  Both times it left my windshield perfectly waterproof.  Best time to use it is when it's dry.  If you use it when it's raining it'll bounce off the water instead of going into the windshield.  I just spray a splash or two every time I start my car that way it's always ready in case it rains.  And when the thunderstorms come and people are pulling off the side of the road because their wipers can't keep up, you won't barely even need wipers since the rain beads up and runs off.  Perfect product!This works well so I can keep my unit inside the garage yet hook up my vehicle when there is no room to park it inside . I have to batteries in a camper van . I used to have to crawl under and hook it up in winter meaning it didn't always get done . With the proper disconnects attached it is no longer a difficult thing to do . Just make sure the leads can't rub on anything .on my car's windshield. I lost one piece while driving in the rain. I don't know why it came off completely without warning.
I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.
You certainly don't want your expensive rack to get stolen.  This is cheap insurance.  Fits well and works well.  I do not leave my rack on all the time so this lock/pin does not see harsh weather or repeated rains.  For me, it works exceptionally well.  I like the fact that after it is unlocked, to relock doesn't require the key, you can just insert it back on and it is locked.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.i've tried really cheap wheel cleaner and this brand as well as meguiars, they all work the same. mother wheels cleaner doesnt clean the tires well, does clean the rims if you use the appropriate brush. its ok.....
NICE PRODUCT DOES WHAT IS MEANT TO DO. THE TAPE SEEMS TO HOLD PRETTY GOOD ONLY TIME WILL TELL SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ALONG TIME AGO.THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE.BOUGTH THESE WITH THE THOUGHT OF REPLACING CLEANING CLOTHS OR RAGS AS THEY ARE BETTER KNOWNTHESE ACTUALLY DO THE JOB AND THE PRICE IS GREAT
This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far.It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
Hopkins 08525 Graduated Level A GOOD LEVEL FOR YOUR TRAILER. FOUND IT FOR LESS AT WALMART. THANKS =). Hopkins 08525 Graduated Level A GOOD LEVEL FOR YOUR TRAILER. FOUND IT FOR LESS AT WALMART. THANKS =)THIS IS THE PART NUMBER FOR MY TRUCK... TO REMOVE THE OLD ONE YOU NEED A PAIR OF NEEDLE PLIERS .....TYPICAL OF ALL OTHER MEGUIAR PRODUCTS......GREAT.....REALLY PUTS A SHINE TO MY BOAT...LOOKS LIKE NEW NOW...EASY TO APPLY AND EASY TO BUFF....GOES A LONG WAY AS WELL...ENOUGH TO DO MY 18' BOAT SEVERAL TIMES OVER....GOOD PROTECTION...
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same carI have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.This is the kind of spark plug gapper / gap tool you should use when gapping Iridium spark plugs. Simply wonderful.
This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket.Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my carsFits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.
Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust.  Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid.  Will update with results.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.i tested it with another gauge and it gave an accurate reading . Make sure you keep it secure to the valve or it will leak air out
What can I say, it's a funnel.  Does the job as expected. Has a nice large fill hole so the liquids go in quickly.What can I say? It does what it says and I like the weight of it...makes it feel solid. I also like the LED light they put in so you can take the pressure in the dark/dim light.What can I say it's an air filter for a car, it fit and came in a box.  Nuff said
This is a tough unit and critical to clean the windows of my RV and truck.  I am glad I bought the 'used' one -- couldn't tell it wasn't brand new!  The unit is a little heavy - but that's good for what it does.  I wish I could adjust the angle of the step plate though... right now when mounted it actually is ~10* dropped from level and I would not want to slip off this thing (but the louvers will preclude that from happening I suspect).While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.Neat little gadget.  Working as it should from out of the box.  It is a little large if you like checking tire depth from the top of the tire with a low profile vehicle.  Now I have to work at ground level!!
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.Bought this for my Honda vehicle as a replacement for the OEM Honda cabin filter.  Compared the number of pleats, same.  Fits the frame just the same.  Lower cost than an OEM filter.  Highly recommended.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.If you own a Hi-Lift, I may suggest to have this repair kit. You don't know when you will have to use it.
Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied.Very useful charger. I mounted it in the engine bay near the battery and it works as intended.Only downside to this charger is the length of the plug cord. It worked well for my application though because i mounted it in tandem with a flush-mount sealed power port on the side of the vehicle.It allowed my battery to remain topped up and warm enough to start at 35 below zero like it was no big deal.I will be ordering a second for an other vehicle.
The filter fits perfectly.  The instructions for replacing the used filter are incomplete as they do not address the touring model which has a slow release lever to open the lower glove box gently. It must be detached first. Then the stops on both side must actually be removed (they are designed that way) to lower the glove box and access the filter holder.  Because plastic parts must be detached and removed this process should not be done in cold weather conditionsWorks really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored.An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.
I bought this to help with when I wax the car. I like the micro fiber fabric alot better than anything else I have used in the past.I bought these as emergency First Aid kits for the cars in my family. I have not had a chance to try them yet. I hope I never have to. I added some more Triple antibiotic packs and more band aid sizes. I also added individually packed aspirins,I use a less expensive oil in most of my vehicles. But I use the Royal Purple in my race car and high performance vehicles when only the best will do. I have always had good results with this oil and I feel it is better than Amsoil or Mobil One.
I've always preferred the PureONE oil filter due to it's filtering ability. There are many reviews out there showing how good this filter is. BOITG forums also has many reviewsMany are dated reviews and I wish someone would have a thorough review of current filters on the market. Everything I have read has told me no major design changes have taken place and it is still as great as the original.Since I have been using them I haven't found any reviews that have made me stop. For my vehicle, a 2005 Hyundai Elantra, it is known that the bypass valve needs to be at a lower pressure and flow more free, like the OEM filter, to stop valvetrain chatter. I have not noticed this issue with my vehicle but have in others.Another concern people have is that it filters so much that the flow is lowered. I have not seen any of these issues with my current or past vehicles. So just due to the filtering ability of the filter I will continue to use it. it fits perfectly and the gold textured grip on the external filter allows me to not use an oil filter wrench for installation or removal.Purchased these for emergency use with our 2009 FIT.  I have not used them yet, but made sure they fit the wheels and did not hit anywhere in the wheel wells.  They were fine on both counts.  Also seem to be of high quality, given the price.  The only comment I might suggest to the next purchaser is regarding rubber tighteners which Amazon lists as an item frequently purchased together.  The chain manufacturer's instructions state that you should not use rubber tighteners with these cable chains as it might pull them off center and then cause damage to tires/vehicle from the chains.I only had a set of small metal chocks that came with the floor jack I have so I went with a chock with a little more size. I bought these and am very happy with them. A nice bright red/orange color for visibility, comes with a small rope loop to hang on the wall or pull out from tire placement and sturdy construction. It has rows of ridges to hold against the tire and on the bottom to prevent slipping. I'm sure the bottom ridges will work on soft surfaces but I'll have to wait until I use them to see if they slip or not on concrete / hard surfaces. I recommend this product.
2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.I bought this extension cable so I could reach my motorcycle. My garage only has one outlet in it and it's on the other side of the garage. I didn't want to move both cars just to be able to plug in my bike to charge. The extension cable has a great length and durable feel to it.
I purchased this wheel lock punch for my newly acquired OEM wheel locks i purchased from Amazon. The only thing i hate about this pouch is that it is not made of the material depicted in the picture. It is made out of Nylon.I think this is a decent replacement product compared to the much more expensive OEM brand.  It really does freshen the air in your car.  The only problem that I find is that the frame is made of cardboard instead of hard plastic like the OEM.Nice brush.  Does what it is made to do and cleanup is easy.  Which the handle was longer so I could get deeper into the drum.
Using a little Permatex Dielectric grease on the spark plug connectors will help remove them later as well as sealing out moisture.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.i used on rear brake shoe replacement.  It goes on easily without fuss or mess.  Hopefully it performs as expected.
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.While this is a high tech charger it has a few things that annoy. First it shuts down in a brief power outage and you must restart it. This applies to when you plug it in. You have to set it to the proper setting. Since it has two settings, one for small batteries and one for automobiles I don't see how the manufacturer could avoid this, so while annoying, it is necessary. Second, is the connectors. They are not the standard type trickle charger connectors so you have to purchase and adapter if you have other vehicles already hardwired. I bought one here for $12. I feel this should have been included with the charger. Other than that it has worked as advertised for the past 3 months and I do recommend it for it's advanced battery maintenance.The size is deceiving. I got this for my dad who was kind of used to those heavy metal-cased chargers that need special care not to destroy the battery. The nice thing about these CTEK chargers are that they are &#34;smart&#34; and require no special treatment. It really is idiot proof: just plug and play.And I can attest to the &#34;reconditioning&#34; feature. It will NOT resurrect a totally dead battery, but if you have an old battery that's marginal (meaning it is borderline: may or may not start your car/tractor/whatever), it will make it better! We tested this on a marginal tractor battery. It only started if it felt like it before, but after reconditioning it was significantly better.The only feature I wish it had was a &#34;boost&#34; feature. But any charger with a useful boost feature of any use has to be a really large one so it would be impossible to fit that feature in this form factor. A spare battery is better than any &#34;boost&#34; feature anyways. You'd be better off keeping a spare battery sitting around to jump start your vehicles. I kept my old car battery, reconditioned it and leave it charged in my garage for that purpose.
What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know.Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.If you own a Hi-Lift, I may suggest to have this repair kit. You don't know when you will have to use it.
Ordered this product for my 2010 HD limited and it already had the connector installed on the bike just plug it in and your bike will have a fully charged battery every time you are ready to ride. Hard to bet the price on this as HD get about 40.00 for the same item.This Scan reader has already saved me $$$.  I have an 06 Chev 2500 diesel I bought new.  I have had it into the dealers a number of times and they always say "you need a new turbo unit at $3000.  But the truck runs fine I just keep getting a `Check engine' light off and on.  Bought this "Pocketscan Code Reader" and it tells me the code and allows me to reset the `check engine light.Is there an engine problem?  Could be but since this check engine light issues started I've towed an 8000 lb travel trailer 2000 plus miles.  Truck continues to run just fine. I can reset the check engine light a lot of times before the issue is worth spending $3000 to eliminate that irritant.  Dealer charges $90 to reset the light.'Update:  New code arrived and since I was going to have the diesel filter replaced I asked the dealership to check it.  (it was a free chech since I was already in the shop.  They said need to replace the glow plugs since the truck has 80,000 miles on it.  $300.00 plus installation for the 8 plugs.  Checked at home using the scan reader and yes, one (1) glow plug was inop.  Cost $40 for plug and 20 Minutes to install.  Problem solved.Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again,
This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.DixitArmor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look!This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
because I ordered this device along with a backup camera for my RV.  However, when I went to install the backup camera, their instructions said not to install it if there is a back up alarm installed.  The only reason that I could think of was that the current draw of both the camera and the alarm my exceed the fuse capacity of the backup lights and cause it to fail.  Anyway, I am further researching this and hope to get this resolved soon.  So the product looks good and is well packaged.  But I have not tried it yet.After reading the reviews and what each had to say about this disconnect switch, I purchased two. One for the engine battery and the other for the coach batteries in my RV.  The mounting bracket is "hefty". With the mounting hardware, it was a breeze installing these two switches. It is well worth the price just for the mounting bracket alone. Sturdy is the word I use for the switch. The only negative comment would be that I wish the key can be removed after engaging the switch. Yea, I know some would say it will keep you from forgetting the disconnect and take the key with you. I just prefer to have the ability to remove the key after the switch has been engaged.  Just me.I have had this cap wrench for 20 years, I first bought it for my 1993 Tercel. It worked on the metal canister oil filters of the Tercel and it also works on my 2012 Camry 4 cyl as well. I cannot understand the large number of reviews stating that this wrench broke - how tight are the oil filters they are removing??? I cannot imagine this one breaking if the oil filter is installed properly. The only complaint I have is it sticks to the filter housing (both the metal filter of the 1993 Tercel and plastic housing on the 2012 Camry) so you have to rock it back and forth with your ratchet to get it off.
haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I used this on my 03 GSXR 600 to replace the factory beep, beep horn. This horn is a lot better than the weak factory horn. It has a loud low tone similar to a cargo van or F150 truck. This is great especially on a bike now people can hear me honking with their car windows up. It was easy to install. It comes with a bracket and bolt. Well worth the money.
A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.used this in my 2007 raptor 700 se,, installs the same as the originals that i used to get.. the quality on this looks a little better...Bought this for my 2005 325it Sportswagon.  It looks exactly like the one I bought from BMW for a third less.  The only thing missing on this filter is the BMW roundel.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.
This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System TesterI received it as a gift a few weeks ago, and am selling it again.There is no real benefit of having such a unit.First, the mounting is an issue as you have the cable running across your dashboard. Having a second plug on the right side is interfeering with gear shifting and whatever controls you have in your center console. It would be better to have a plug on the left side. Using the one in the back makes the cable run all across the dashboard, no thank you.Second, besides the tachometer (if you don't have one) what data readout do you really need? Really need? Nothing, exactly. Codes can be red out by any Auto place for free, and what are you doing if your converter speed is at a certain speed? Exactly, see what I mean? Okay, volts maybe, but just maybe.The unit, sent back to ScanGauge for testing, does hardly come on by itself, so you don't really know if any of the fuel/trip data is accurate. This makes it already questionable, and therefore I do not have any use for it.So, for us it is another item where we have to question its quality and reliability.Less than 1 month old, contact me if you want it. I take of 20% right away.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.
Purchased as a replacement for a 2004 Ford Taurus.  Lasted about 7 months before it burned out.  Replaced this item with NGK brand, OEM manufacturer.  I do not recommend this item if you plan on keeping the car.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it.

Install is pretty straight forward.Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as well
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower.in my 08 tahoe, i changed plug and wires recently, i used Tune up Grease both inside of the wire boots and on the porcelain section of the plugs.I installed a set of iridium plugs and a set of ferrite wires in my 08 tahoe, the wires came with a tiny packet of tune up grease but this never seems like enough to me (not that i apply a lot, keep it simple.)the &#34;average&#34; fuel economy on the dash instant read computed had been stalled at 13.9 MPG for a very long time, this is a composite of in town and highway driving. I changed the plugs and wires with the help of this tune up grease and reset the average MPG, within 10 days my average is up to 14.8.I did NOTHING to the vehicle other than install wires and the plugs.This grease helps ensure a good, insulated connection and is a must for a little job like this which can make a difference in your mileage.this is a big tube and will last you a lifetime.
Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.This has a lot of uses beyond car applications. I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound. I used a sheet of it inside a computer case, to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on. You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess. It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover, and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind. So, choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down!
MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5After I got my CV from the auction, I ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it. They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined "top," and a vague "bottom." Some bulbs have a kind of a "z" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an "industry rule of thumb," not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a "real" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO "NOT" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on "low beam," then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of "the rule." I have found on my car that aligning the "top" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the "driver's side" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to "play it by ear" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be "self-aiming" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly. Safe driving!This is the OEM cabin air filter for the 2006 Acura TL, and trust me: this thing does what it's supposed to do. I couldn't believe how much crud this thing had caught between the B12 service on my girlfriend's 2006 TL.One thing I will say is that this is a PITA to replace. After disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console, pull the console down. Directly down. That means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly... or you'll break a tab and your interior will never be the same. I've seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left. Don't be another.
I purchased this because it fits in the same bag that I keep my trailer ball mount in. This way I always have a lug wrench with me in case I get a flat tire on my trailer. It's a nice quality tool and one of the sockets fits my trailer lugs. Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it if you're looking for a space-saving way of carrying around a lug wrench.Bought this for a piece of yard equipment.  It fit and worked fine.  Not a lot to say, it's just a spark plug, but I have had no problems.  Don't expect to change this for another 10 years.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.
Valterra is known for quality RV products and accessories, this is no exception. Shipping was on time and product was exactly what I was expecting.Woody Allen would approve of this effective cleaner. Works we'll and the smell is good. Can't usually go wrong with this brand. This product is not available in most stores.This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?
Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLIt does what it is supposed to and suds up.
I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different.Like other reviewers, I found that the nozzle spins or not, as it chooses. I tested it three different times, and it only spun one of those times. Obviously, this is something you can't easily detect or fix once the unit is installed.Back to Amazon. I'll use the wand-down-the-toilet until I find a product that works properly.OEM from K&N... I have not used it yet but it is just the same as you can purchase anywhere else for the premium price. I am new to K&N air filters so I will provide additional feedback if I find it does not work as advertised later on...
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.I am sure this will work fine next fall when I put the bikes to sleep for the winter. I borrowed a can of fogger from a friend of mine for this winter.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same.

Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderbought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
Purchased 3. Good idea and worked for about 2-3 weeks then I opened up my RV one day to find them on the ground. Double sided tape is a major flaw. I only had 2 DVD's in one and other 2 empty so should of held up. I did everything like clean the wall prior to installing but still can't expect a thin piece of tape to hold it for to long. Another thing is you can see the white foam tape on the sides after attaching which looks poor. I didn't give up though...I mounted them with small brass L brackets and screws now and no more issues.Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good LuckArmor All tire shine does a great job.  I use it on two vehicles tires, a Malibu and Chev 2500 Pickup.  Lasts a couple of weeks, unless it rains of course.  I get 3 to 4 all tire shines per can.  Recommend!
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.I bought two sets of Braxton seat covers: A tan set, and this grey set.  They both fit well and look good.Installation was easier than I expected.  Not surprisingly, they were much easier to slide over the leather seats.  It wasn't hard getting them on my cloth seats, just a bit more difficult.  On the up side, they don't slip around as much on the cloth seats.The seat covers have a little flap that you have to wedge through the gap where the seat bottom meets the seat back.  That flap has holes in it.  The bottom of the seat cover, near the back, has an elastic band on each side, with a plastic hook on the end.  (Two extra hooks are also included with each cover, affixed in a little bag to the inside of the seat cover bottom.)  After sliding the seat cover into place and getting the flap through that gap, you attach the hooks to the holes in the flap.The hardest part of installation wasn't the fault of the seat covers, but because of how my Sonata's seats are designed.  The cloth on the seat back extends past the gap where the seat back meets the seat bottom.  There are a couple hidden straps that hook the cloth to the underside of the seat.  Once I figured out how to unhook that, I was able to access the flaps of the seat covers, and finish installation.I got two slightly different "versions" of the Braxton seat covers.  My grey set is, according to the date on the box, a few years older than the tan set.  The flap on the older seat covers is a simple flap with two holes in it.  The tan set I have has flaps with four holes in them, and the end of the flaps also have a spongy, cylindrical insert in them.  This insert is presumably intended to help keep the seat cover in place.  The additional holes must be to accommodate different seat designs.  I found both changes (the extra holes and the spongy insert) completely needless, but maybe on some vehicles they would be helpful.  The spongy insert did (of course) make it harder to get the flap through the gap in the seat.In short, these seat covers fit smoothly in both my cars.  They look quite good and they don't slide around enough to be a problem.  They make leather seats more comfortable year-round, and they help keep sweat and dirt off cloth seats.Be sure to check your owner's manual before installing seat covers. Some vehicles have air bags built into the seats, and any kind of covering could impede air bag function. (In fact, the aforementioned Sonata has air bags built into the seats, and I had to stop using these covers in that car.)Recommended!It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too).
I ordered these tire irons to change the tires on my Buell Blast, The fact that they include a pouch to keep the Tire irons in is a great addition. I used them to mount my rear tire (Pirelli Diablo) and it really held up to the job. I was think that with the way that I was cranking on these that it would bend, but not so. I would have to agree with other reviews that to have another pack so that I would have 3 Tire irons to use while mounting is a good idea. I know it ups the price a bit, but it's worth it. i did get my tire mounted with just two, but I did notice there was a point where I wouldn't have minded having a 3rd...Great Tire Iron, I would recommend these..I use these to cover my original Honda floor mats.  I had to trim an area in the left upper corner so it would fit, but after doing that, it does the trick.  Granted, these are not top quality, but I only wanted something to protect my good carpet floormats.  For $13.50, you can't beat it.  I would highly recommend.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.
I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon.As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.
can't have too many of these guys, a must if you do any electronics work, tinkering. seem to be of good quality and hold on well.I do not know if this is any better than any other but I have 4 of them and have given several as presents. This works on all types of batteries and even my 2009 BMW motorcycle when BMW says it will not.Good productI purchased two of these 20' ft heavy duty tow straps to leave in the back of my 2007 tahoe.  I have pulled multiple cars out of ditches with these straps. They are a life saver and not expensive.  I would have paid double for these.  These are a great emergency item to leave in the trunk of your car.  You never know when you will need them.
Theses are the best deal around for price and quality and simple to install when you remover the rollers holding your Honda glove compartment door and slide and open the box to replace the filters. These work as well as the more expensive name brand filters and can easily be used more than a few times by occasionally taking them out and cleaning them by slapping them face-down on the pavement. Amazing how much stuff these filters catch.Using a little Permatex Dielectric grease on the spark plug connectors will help remove them later as well as sealing out moisture.as described - they are very useful and come out of the wash nicely - when these wear out i will order again
This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.Try to find a cabin air filter of this quality  anywhere near the price that it is being sold on Amazon. Replacement is easy (it's in the glove compartment) and your Honda  owners manual will show you how to do it.Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.
good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.
This digital gauge is easy to use and to read, even in bright sun light. It has a wide range so you can use it on high pressure tires.Alot of gauges only go up to 60 psi which is too low for load range E tires.Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern.Tight fit that is snug. A bottom fist strike seats cap. We will see soon how it handles a road trip.
After living in Downtown Los Angeles for over 2 years, I have had about 5 bouts of tire leaks due to punctures.  Before I found out about this product, I used the traditional DIY method of repairing my tire--with a traditional kit (you know--the kind you can get at Pep Boys or Autozone).  It was always an exhausting, time consuming process.  I'm not a very strong person and most of the punctures were with small objects (pallet nails, staples). Imagine having to stuff a thick, dull rasp tool through extremely thick tire tread.. Not fun. Many times I felt like giving up.  Also, threading a thick rubber embedded cord through a very thin slot was always difficult too.  Always ended up having to use needle nose pliers to pull it through requiring several tries.Along comes this product. I used this on my latest repair and it was simply amazing.  WOW.  Slick it up, insert the little plug into the tool, slick up the tool and hole with some more spit, and push it in.  The tool is smooth and goes in with way less effort.  Pull it out and snip the remainder.  Done!  By a very large margin, the absolute EASIEST tire repair tool you will EVER use.For *extremely* small holes, it can still require a bit of effort, but no where near the unimaginable effort that would have been required of the typical rasp and thread-end tools.  Just be sure to use spit.  (Water doesn't work nearly as well).Summary:PROS:-Makes repairing the smallest leaks much easier.-Fast.  Can repair a tire in half the time.  Some have even repaired their tires without removing them.-Permanent. Dynaplugs have been approved in Europe for permanent tire repair.-Use way less strength.  Only a single tool, and it is very thin.-Convenient storage in handle for extra plugs, and the pipe cleaner. There is enough room to even store a couple of small alchohol swabs in it.-Can be used to repair previous traditional plugs that have failed.-Fool proof.  Awesome design allows you to push the tool in ALL THE WAY, and pull out.  Traditional plugging can be pushed in too far or not far enough.-Can repair other failed patches.-Versatile.  Dynaplug can be applied multiple times to the same hole to repair larger holes.CONS:-The tool may get dirty on the inside and be hard to insert additional plugs in the same session.  The tool comes with a felt pipe cleaner which can be dabbed in alcohol to clean the inside.  Best way to avoid this is to ensure the plug and tool is well lubricated.I am truly thankful to the inventor of this amazing little tool.  It has enabled weaksauces like me to fix a tire in a matter of seconds :)Verdict:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDUPDATE: 4/24/2013  (since January 11, 2012)This product is suitable for emergency patches but I have deemed them not good enough for permanent repairs for two reasons:1. The brass tips are not secured onto the plug strongly enough.  They can pop off just by tugging on the plug slightly. Because of this, I have had several brass tips fall into the tire and cause rattling from inside the wheel at high speed or when making turns.  It's very annoying.2. I read somewhere that these plugs were good enough for permanent repairs and assume it's for the reason that the brass tips keep the plug from coming back out.  That would be true only if the brass tips are secured tightly to the plug.  But for this reason they are functionally not any better than traditional plugs for holding in air. Their only benefit is their size, which makes it easy to plug smaller holes.  The downside is that for larger holes, you have to use many of them, and each time you insert a new plug, there is a high possibility that the insertion may push on an existing tip and cause it to come loose.The following photo was sent to me by my dealership when I complained of loud clicking noises coming from the rear wheels:https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/400750_10151554978947590_716723726_n.jpgFor this reason, I revise my recommendation to "RECOMMENDED--FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY.", however I have lowered the review to 3 stars.This tool is designed to get behind the lip of a dynamic oil seal, without having to remove the shaft, or disassemble an entire gearbox to be able to drive it out from behind.  It works, by having a thin 'hook' that you can work under the lip of the seal, and then you use the handle to 'lever' it out.As a labor saving device, it works pretty well.However, the hook has to be thin enough, to be able to wiggle between the seal lip, and the shaft, and being that thin, it isn't terribly strong.  There is a reason, a spare hook comes with the tool.I would not classify this, as my tool of choice for seal removal, so much as a special use tool, that you pull out to turn a 2 hour R&R; job, into a 15 minute one, and for that it works well.  The hook is just too delicate for continual use, and will break sooner or later.  I have not priced replacement hooks yet, I still have one good one.  Maybe if they were super cheap, I would rate it 4 stars.  As it is, I have trouble rating it over 3 stars, when I broke the hook on the 3rd or 4th seal I tried it on.  To be fair, I just tried 'levering' it out, and maybe if I was being a little more careful, it might not have happened.I needed this to remove the wiper arms on my 2003 VW Golf. The drivers side arm was particularly difficult to remove. It was so hard in fact, I had to modify this puller to get the arm off. This modification is the sole reason for dropping the rating to 4 stars.Overall the quality of this puller is 5 stars. As mentioned by others the cone that is shown in the picture as being metal is in fact plastic. To me this is absolutely no issue at all though and is likely a rolling design change, which explains why the picture still shows it being metal. The force on the cone is minimal so there really is nothing wrong with it being plastic.The puller arms themselves are made of very strong steel and held up very well when pulling my seemingly welded on wiper arm. All of the stressed parts are strong and well made so this puller is likely to be the only one you will ever need for both battery connections and wiper arms alike.There is one problem I had with this puller. Had my arm not been so stubborn to get off it likely wouldn't have been an issue. The problem is the handle for turning the screw. What ever they made it from it is very strong. I didn't bent it no matter how hard I cranked on it. Conversely though, I couldn't generate enough torque to get the arm to break free. Also, the hood of my car was in the way so I had a hard time getting at it at certain points in the rotation. The solution was pretty basic for me, but would be nearly impossible without a lathe and a welder, which most people of course do not have.I cut the tee handle from the puller and then I drilled a hole in the end of a bolt so I could put the bolt only the shaft of the tool. I then welded it to the tool shaft. This allowed me to use a wrench or socket to turn the puller shaft instead of the tee handle. Once I had a socket on there I was able to easily get the torque I needed to break the arm free. Had this puller been of low quality materials this additional torque would have destroyed it. It did not break though, it held up just fine. Which makes me wonder why Lisle doesn't have a hex on top instead of the tee handle. I'm guessing they are concerned that people would over torque it and as strong as this is, I'm sure it is not of unlimited strength.I do think that in 90% or more of all situations this puller would work perfectly just the way it is built. In my case, living where they salt the heck out of the roads, things can be pretty hard to get apart. As an example though the passenger side popped off with no issue at all.I'd recommend this to just about anyone.
can't have too many of these guys, a must if you do any electronics work, tinkering. seem to be of good quality and hold on well.How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...These are easy to use and comes with many sizes.  Take your time and the fuel line will disconnect just fine.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.
No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...
I have a 2001 Silverado with a 5.3 engine. On the 2001, 5.3 engine the Knock sensors sit in deep pockets. Water tends to get down in there sooner or later and that causes the knock sensors to fail. Replace the harness while you are at, as the harness is the seal.I was very optimist about this product to help avoiding the stabalizers to sink in the grass, this past weekend I used for the first time in the grass, it rained and it sank deep and when I pulled the stabilizers up, and removed the pads they were bent, they do not hold their flat struture in a "soft" grass, if you do grass camping with motorhome that will not work, I am thinking I will still need a piece of 2x6 under the pad.I have a Jeep Rubicon. Off road or on the beach there are times I need to air down the tires. After a day of fun I need to air the tires back up. Enter the Viair.This is as rugged, fast and dependable cigaret lighter powered air compressor as I've used or seen. I have large tires and this will air up a 17&#34;  P265 tire in a couple of minutes.I do notice some heat around the pump's housing after the second tire. A short rest (just to be nice to the compressor) and the other two tires go up without a hitch.I can heartily recommend this compressor.
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellI use this item. I use alot of Meguiar's products for my detailing. You don't need alot to make it happen,  SWI use this on all my auto bulbs. Helps when you need to remove bulbs especially on my trailers an vintage vehicles. This is a, Must Have Item. I recommend this Dielectric Grease.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.
Summer heat car cool get for car it be good make A/C work better no more sad hot dash or hot wheel yay.
I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.I think this Hitchmate Hand Signal Cover is such a cute idea.  My dad loves it, which surprised me.  He doesn't strike me as someone who likes cute.  I tried it out on his Jeep Wrangler, which has the larger receiver.  It fit just fine. Once the hardware is installed (takes four screws), it's easy on easy off.  What the hitch cover is missing is the locking pin.  If you buy this, you need to provide your own locking pin.The fingers bend to make whatever hand gestures I want.  Some fingers don't bend completely when the hand is on the car in certain directions because the car gets in the way.  I'm sure this is more or less of a problem depending on the type of car.  If I want to turn the hand from upright to horizontal, I need to unscrew the hardware and reposition it.Everyone instinctively knows what hand gesture they'd like this hitch cover to make.  It's capable of that, also.  Some jokesters can have a field day with it.  Depending on where you park, just be careful.I don't know what the water is like in all the campgrounds we go to, and don't want to have to check the water! Having this attached to the water supply is just plain common sense!
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI'm hoping the quality holds up as they appear plastic and my trailer weighs  over 5000lbs and sits on a small incline.  I will correct my review if they don't work but they were a good price.Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.
This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct.I just purchased a black 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (that I love) and this steering wheel cover looks sharp!!!If you are considering this cover and are looking at the negative reviews keep these things in mind:-Steering wheel covers are hard to get on in general.  This is so the cover does not slip and cause you to loose your grip on the steering wheel while driving.  Yes, it took a little muscle but I'm 5'3", 125lbs and after getting the top part of the cover on the wheel, with a little help from one of my (girl) friends, we were able to slide the bottom on together.-All leather/plastic/rubber steering wheel covers stink at first and it can rub off on to your hands.  The smell does go away though!-This cover looks sharp and is well made.  If you like the way it looks, I would highly recommend it to all Jeep lovers!!!I beleave I can really feel the difference in the power in the car can't tell the difference in mileage yet . The engine is quieter and smother running . Yes I would recommend this oil to all my friends.Paul
Tried once and loved it straight away. Apply and wipe of directly on cars which are light dust on it. Used it in interiors as well. Loved the fragrance. Adds hydrophobic coat as well.Had planned to drop these behind the wheels on the truck when we put the boat over.But they want to slip on the concrete ramp as soon as the tire tread starts to push.Doesn't seem to matter whether I plant them before easing the tires back, or hard-place them at the tires, because as soon as enough drift happens, the tire and chock move together.I kind of like the strong on the beck of these wheel chocks. Theya re portable and travel well. I use these to chock minivans and suvs when I help my family to preventative maintenance on their vehicles for oil changes, brake pad changes, etc. They dont feel as flimsy as those cheap black ones youd get from wal Mart. These feel more durable and well built, yet lightweight.
Works good, installed on my 2012 Kaw Voyager 1700. I installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box. Use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work, sound awesome too.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push down
These are solid jacks for trailers that sit high. I use two of these jacks on a small off-road box trailer that's pulled by a Jeep so it sits high. The trailer has a rough top tent mounted on top of it, and with these the trailer is stable with jacks underneath. They're easy to adjust and level the trailer out.I did however find one of the chains was broken for a pin. It's a minor issue but I can't give it a perfect rating for that reason.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.I have this cover on a Harley Road Glide and it fits well with the tour pak on or off.So far it has protected the bike well in medium rain showers, which is the most rain I have used it in.  I also use it to cover the bike when stored in a garage.It has a nice small bag and fits easily in my saddle bag taking up a small amount of space.
Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car!I have one of these in each of my vehicles, either in the door pocket, center console or glove box.  I didn't mount them because having them loose in a covered compartment seemed a better idea.  I also have the key chain versions (ResQme)as a back-up in case the trapped person cannot reach the one in the door, etc.I have only had to use this device once when a Blazer flipped over on the Interstate in front of me.  The first person on the scene tried several times to break the rear window with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful.  My life-hammer did the job effortlessly with the first swing, and the seat-belt cutter quickly ripped through the belt to release the trapped driver!These should seriously be standard equipment in ALL vehicles!Need a 90 degree to make life easier on one of my bikes,  one has a 90 degree on the tires already but this fit the bill on my GL1200. only problem I can see is the pin in the center is  plastic so dont know the longevity on it.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.
I was a touch skeptical. But I can afford to throw it out if I don't like it.  Well I can say, I will NOT be throwing this out!  I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self. Why didn't I buy this sooner. And it is true. A little goes a long way.I love the way it did spread evenly. I thought that I was going to have to use the whole tube of wax. But I don't think I used 1/4 of it. And I have a SUV. I was able to only use one of the applicator. But with this one I am glad I got it. I approve this review. HahahahahahahahahI bought this unit to check the cooking oil of my deep fryer.  I have actually used it to confirm that a deep fryer I had bought was not cooking to 375F as advertised.  I use it every time my other machine says target temp is reach so I can confirm it.  Can't wait to use it for other things.
Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.  I typically prefer to go up a size on wipers since it gives a larger clean area.  You can typically go up 2 inches which translates to one inch per side from where the blade attached to the arm.  When the car is dirty, you should be able to see where that extra inch goes - if it hits the top of the trim or other part, you're out of luckWe're using a 28" blade on the drivers side of my wife's Mazda5, and this clears very nicely - no skips or squeaking.  Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...
Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size.What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.Precise sizes since they weren't listed in any description: .045 .080 .050 .040 .060 .044I used to gap 4 NGK Iridium IX spark plugs. The tool's metal didn't bend. Would buy again.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2
I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.II have had these on my 2003 Tahoe for over 1yr & they work great.will put them on my 1986 cutlass when they need to be changed.
II have had these on my 2003 Tahoe for over 1yr & they work great.will put them on my 1986 cutlass when they need to be changed.strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.probably the 5th of these &#34;strong arms&#34; that ive purchased.  ive had them for up to 5 years and ive never had a single issue.  they hold their pressure very well.  winter, summer, you name it.  even on my liftgate from hell on my 1999 grand cherokee.
I ordered this to remove the filter housing on my 2011 Prius.  It is a solid and quality socket. You will not regret buying this Oil Filter Socket. I am very satisfied with it.I put this on a 2008 Ford Escape at the last oil change.  I am comforted to use the factory OEM for unmatched quality.  I will purchase this again in 7500 miles.  the price on Amazon was great although sometimes Rockauto is very competitive.I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.
they are light and smaller than you would expect, but they work fine and store easy as they fit into one another (stackable)I got them for my Camry and they are perfect fit for front or rear seat head rests.Convenient to carry shirts from laundry, hang umbrella, wife's purse and grocery bags.Careful you don't drop the adapters when prying the package open (don't ask).  Product seems to fit well but time will tell.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price.This tube is probably large enough for 5-10 brake jobs. I used this product when replacing the front rotors and pads on my 1999 Toyota Corolla about 2 weeks ago without any problems.
Love this product. I am wheelchair bound and use this to charge my chair when I'm in the van. Great productI ordered this to remove the filter housing on my 2011 Prius.  It is a solid and quality socket. You will not regret buying this Oil Filter Socket. I am very satisfied with it.I purchased this fluid to use in a GM manual gearbox. Overall al I would say I am pretty happy with it.
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.I used this for an oil change on a 2007 Saturn Vue Hybrid. I find it odd how the GM ecotec have the oil filter canister right below the exhaust manifold. This socket fits under it without a problem allowing it to have room to unscrew the filter out of the canister. Worth the buy if you ever plan on changing the oil in your GM Ecotec vehicle! Or just to have in general in case you ever get a friend to change your oil for you!I could give you a long review full of performance enhancement claims, but I'll just be blunt. Ever since I switched to K&N, my used oil seems less dirty when I drain it and having the 1" nut welded to the top of the filter makes changing it a breeze. If you own a car with a hard to reach filter, that nut alone will make it worth every penny of the filter's cost. I have a Toyota Camry where I can barely even get my hand back to the filter through the tiny opening, let alone get enough leverage to loosen it by hand or use a conventional filter wrench. Not an issue with this filter. 1" socket on a ratchet with an extension shaft and it comes right off in just a few seconds.
What can you say except that it holds a lot and has a big opening. The lid doesn't have a gasket so don't tilt or turn over. the only other small gripe is the hinge on the lid hits the handle and will probably help the fatigue factorExtremely nice heavy duty comes with a debris cover for the lock mechanism as well, the utube videos showing  bic pen is a load of crap as well, unless you have the key it isn't coming off.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
Bought this in May 2012.I usually carry jumper cables in my car, but not anymore. Jumper cables: you should get a set longer than your vehicle, so you don't have to back it out of a parking spot first. Then with the longer cables, you should get the heaviest gauge wire you can or you lose power through the cables. Then of course you'll need someone with a car or truck to help you!!Solution: Booster PacI really like this battery pack compared to others.1) no unnecessary gadgets like a flashlight, air compressor or 110V AC inverter. While these are handy to have they usually are of poor quality when combined in a package like this.2) Size is great and easier to carry. While all these jumper battery packs are heavy, this one is relatively narrow in width making it easier to carry at your side with arm extended.3) Takes up little room in your trunk and can be locked up with a bicycle cable lock.4) Can be charged by your auto's 12V adapter. You have to monitor the battery's green "Charge complete" LED  because there is no automatic shutoff when the charged through the 12V outlet. This means you can overcharge it and reduce it's life and capacity.5) Use it as a power source to recharge your phone or iPad etc.Maintenance notes:Be careful using this as a power supply. The BATTERY is designed to deliver peak power to start your car. It is not designed to deliver continuous power like a car battery or battery back up.For longest battery life recharge as soon as possible after each use and at least once a month.Avoid discharging it to 50% or less as this will eventually decrease power output. Recharge as soon as possible after each use to extend it's useful lifeCons:Only 1: I don't like the AC charger. The brick gets hot and stays hot even when the charge is complete. Must be an old style transformer electric vampire.CHARGING OPTION:I recently bought a modern battery charger/maintainer for the car to top off my car battery and maintain the charge when the car sits. These chargers are not expensive for the lower current models.(about $20 on up)Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerModern chargers are designed to gently charge your battery especially from 80% to full. This charge method will extend the life of your battery and give you maximum amps when you need it. When your battery is full, they go into a Float/monitor mode.I used my new battery charger on this Booster Pac and had great results. I tested the battery Pac with a professional 100Amp battery and alternator tester. The Booster Pac tested  well within the good range which was better than charge with the supplied AC adapter.NOTE: you can use a motorcycle/car battery charger through the Booster Pac jump cables or 12V accessory plug. Both work.Fortunately I have not needed to jump a car since I bought this unit in May 2012.Would definitely buy this again.Took off 1 star for the AC charger that gets hot during and stays hot after the battery is charged. It is a potential fire hazard and wastes energy.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.I'm prepared to jump a car when the battery is dead whenever it occurs, in any weather conditions and for any size engine.  This battery weighs almost 29 pounds.  We keep it fastened to 300 pound capacity multipurpose 2-wheel dolly.  I keep the heavy jumper cables that came with the unit on that dolly.  That's been doing the trick.  I don't use it for anything else.  We've kept the DC charging cable in the accessory bag.Because of our insurance, we keep our instructions attached to the dolly with a laminated sheet.  This includes warnings about making sure the area around the battery is well-ventilated, not to allow flame near it, not to touch a metal tool simultaneously to the positive and negative cables ends, remover personal items such as rings, watches and any metal from your hand or wrist, remove positive terminal first and avoid touching eyes when working with it.  The instructions give the whole sequence for jumping a vehicle engine and also instructions for recharging with the AC charger.This battery has protection against overheating or a surge.  It comes with a replaceable fuse that protects against reverse polarity and short circuits.  You can read the battery's charge status on the digital display as well as output information in green.  You have the battery's charge percentage light.  And the charging status light is on when it's plugged in, flickering when it's charging and remaining green once fully charged.  When the battery is fully charged, you get a very useful incandescent light that lasts a very long time too.  It has 3 AC Outlets for supplying the 120 V of AC power, but it still takes hours to power up.  The instructions say it can take up to 35 hours if it's fully discharged.One thing I didn't need is the radio or alarm clock.  This will be important if you take the battery into the wilderness with you, not as I use it.
I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.Until you use it you can not comment on it.Others have told me it works great for getting a flat fixed until you can make it to a repair shop.I have never had a flat or needed to use anything like this before.But wanted it for my Harley Sportster.  Better to have it than call a tow truck.This is a nice alternative to welding a tab on a hitch for a sway control. While I don't plan on having to move it to another hitch it is nice to know that if I had to I could. Which is something that can't be done with a weld on tab.
You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road.It's a quick and easy way to have a battery hook up on your boat, motorcycle, four wheeler, golf cart, just about anything with a battery in it where you might could use a charger, or 12 volt outlet...WMI installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing.

good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!

This product really works; but you need to put some elbow grease into getting good results.  You can watch a video at the manufactures website with the instructions.Basically what you do is1) Clean the head lights with provided solution2) Sand (yep) with two grits of sandpaper in a back and forth motion using water.3) Polish with a gritty solution4)  Wipe on a solution that fills in any small scratches leftWhat this does is clear up all the little scratches and dings in the plastic that make the light diffract (bounce) around instead of going out through the headlight.  The last solution is some sort of acrylic that must have the same index of refraction (how much it bends light) as the plastic used in the headlights.You really need to put some time and effort into each standing and polishing step.  I found it easier to work with the car lights on in the dark, it made the scratches and dings easier to see.  It took me about an hour and a half to do two cars.  How long probably depends on how bad your headlights are to begin with, the older car took much longer.I was able to clear up the headlights on two cars just barely (I ran out of the last solution) .  One weas a 2003 Mazda Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and the second was a 2005 Hyundai Elantra.  Interestingly the sealing solution worked noticeably better on the Elantra.You will need more paper towels than are provided.  It would be nice if the solutions had different colored labels, you have to be careful to read them each time with each headlight.  If you do not use the gloves you will end up with slightly shiny fingers.BE SURE TO READ THE DIRECTIONS!  You do not want to polish with the sandpaper in circles, for example.A great product that performs as promised.Addition:  I had some of the polishing fluid leftover and decided to try it on the solar panels on the top of some of my decorative solar lights which were no longer charging.  After using the polish on the lights, 4 of the 6 nonworking lights will now charge the batteries again!Well, to start, the only thing that I will complain about is the reservoir jar.It's not well made (may leak air), and doesn't hold that much liquid.I ended up building my own with a mason jar and two nozzles from a local hardware store.Other than the jar, I'm very happy with the kit, especially the the pump.The pump is well made, solid construction with all metal.  The gauge is movable.It has two settings, pump or suction.I used the kit on the following projects the past year:1.. Oil change on mower.Experience: Worked great.2.. Oil Change on Generator.Experience: Worked great.3.. Brake fluid change.Experience: not so great.  No fault to the pump or the kit setup.When using suction with brake fluid change, the fluid doesn't come out in a nice uniform motion where I can examine the bubbles, for example.  The fluid comes out in the tube with a roller coaster fashion (can't see anything.)I think next time I'll go back to the 2-man setup.If anyone has a recommendation on this please let me know.Overall, a great kit (great pump), and would recommend to others.This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlandera regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
Nice lightweight solution.Reduces endless cranking of the front trailer jack.My trailer only weighs a thousand pounds.What more words!Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.My experience with Slime has been limited to bicycle tires, where the product does a good job sealing up pinhole and other small punctures in the tire tube.  I have never used Slime in an automobile tire, but since the materials are basically the same, I would assume that the product would work in a similar way.For an automobile, where the flat occurs makes a big difference.  If your car is parked and notice your tire is flat, this kit would probably be quite useful.  You can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is.  If it is a fast leak, you can try using the Slime and see if it takes care of the problem.  The car does not need to be jacked up to use the product.If the puncture happens when the car is being driven, the problem is more serious.  When you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat, most times you will do heavy duty damage, or tear the tire.  If that happens, Slime won't help.  The tire will need to be replaced.  The instructions state that Slime will not work on punctures greater than 1/4 inch.  So basically, Slime is intended to address only minor tire damage.The Smart Spair kit is a pretty good deal.  It consists of a 16 ounce bottle of slime, and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet.  According to the label, a 16 ounce bottle, should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire.  The 16 ounce bottle is available at Amazon for about nine dollars.  Subtract this cost from the price of the kit, and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars, which is not a bad deal.  The compressor has a pressure valve, ten foot cord, and on/off switch.  It is pretty noisy, and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate.  It is rated for use on a minimum 15 amp circuit.  Some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only 8 amps, so you may want to check this before you buy.Hopefully I will not have to use the Smart Spair.  Based on the good (though limited) experience I have with Slime, I thought it would be good to have around, just in case.  There are many situations, where changing a tire at the side of the road, can be hazardous.  A kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of, jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire.  It does not take a mechanical genius to follow the directions.Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function.
Sprayed some very toxic paint. I did not smell anything. When I took the mask off you could see every thing caught in the filters.This mask is designed so you can make an air tight fix with little or no effort. Once you put it on it stays and does not slip or move. 'Really protects your health. A must for using some spray paints even from a can Please read the labels. Some of this stuff is really dangerous.You certainly don't want your expensive rack to get stolen.  This is cheap insurance.  Fits well and works well.  I do not leave my rack on all the time so this lock/pin does not see harsh weather or repeated rains.  For me, it works exceptionally well.  I like the fact that after it is unlocked, to relock doesn't require the key, you can just insert it back on and it is locked.ok, if you read the reviews, you will see lots of "oh the cord is so long, it has to run by the brake pedals, its not 100% accurate" blah blah wah wah. This device simply reads and displays what the vehicles computer is showing. is anything 100% accurate? hardly. but it does a good job. for the people who say its not helping my mpg, are u kidding? this device does not have anything to do with CONTROLLING your mpgs, your FOOT does! the only way this helps is as a reminder that if you drive like an idiot, u use more gas. if u need a computer to tell u that, dont drive! yes the cord routes by the pedals, thats where OBD ports are. not everything in the world can be bluetooth, deal with it. use a little common sense and route the cord. this thing is handy, and works as advertised. only reason im taking a star away, is that it is a little expensive for what it is, however, with my luck, now that ive bought it, the price will drop. overall a great gadget, that can be saved and used on any future vehicles i may buy.EDIT/UPDATE:  after using the gauge a few different ways now, ive found the average mpg very helpful. it really makes you realize the best way to increase mpg. i thought before if i grandma the pedal always it wud help, takes more than that.
The Milton S506 product was great, was just what I was looking for. I would recommend this to any one!Valterra is known for quality RV products and accessories, this is no exception. Shipping was on time and product was exactly what I was expecting.Old one was crimped under propane cover and I was worried it may develop a leak.  This was an exact replacement.
No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door.I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.The first time I used it to inflate the tires on my garden cart to 35PSI it blew the 15A fuse for my car's cigarette lighter circuit. This also comes with its own 15A fuse as extra protection, but my car's fuse went first.I'm upgrading to model 90P instead which comes with alligator clips that go straight onto the car battery terminals. It starts to slow down when it gets beyond 35PSI so I would NOT consider this "heavy duty" at all, but for most light weight purposes it does the job. This is a cute and small pump.Tip: if you do decide to go with the 70P there are a couple things you can do to decrease the chance of blowing the fuse. 1. turn on the pump before connecting to the tire, and 2. run the engine since the alternator will increase the voltage thereby reducing the amp draw.
Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.
I bought these cause the price seemed good.They chatter unless its pouring out I wont get them again for sure. If you want good wipers get the Rainx lattitudes or Trico Neoform they are both superior to Bosch crap..You cant find these oil  filters any were, Not Autozone, not Pepboys. not Napa,  I found them here on Amazon for $3.00 a piece so I bought 8 of them. Now I dont have to waist my time looking all over town for them, I have my own supply of them!!!Again, these guys are hard to do without.  They are doing the job!  I don't buy the 3-pack, I prefer to buy the individuals in quantities of 3 because, for some reason, I get free shipping on the individual ones, but not on the multi pack one.  So, it came out cheaper to buy them a la carte.  Go Figure!
The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.Why didn't I think of this years ago? I have been using McGard wheel locks exclusively for 30+ years and I usually wrap the lock key in either a shop paper towel or a rag and put in the center console or with the spare. Either way I have doing the 'cheap' version of this and this just makes SO much sense for keeping the wheel lock key in an identifiable location. Bought two (2), one for each vehicle.Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.
Before purchasing this item I called the manufacturer to be sure it did what I wanted.  They said it would but it did not.  i called them back and they said it was capable of what I wanted but I would have to program it for it to work.  Not what you read on the package, not what the manufacturer said, and directions so poor I could not beging to program it and I'm a geek.I had a small divit-like chip in my windshield. I didn't think it warranted the hassle of getting it repaired professionally, so I decided to try this. It really didn't do anything, but it did make the chip flush with the windshield. I'm sure it is now less likely that it will crack, but it is still just as visible if not more. My only guess is that I could have cleaned out the chip a little better, but it seemed I got all of the crushed glass out.I needed a replacement for my 10 year old digital tire gauge, so I thought I'd find something that would really meet my needs.  Since I ride a motorcycle most of the time, and on long distant rides, tire pressure is something that if not done right will ruin your trip.I was going to get a backlit version, but saw this one.  Accessing my R1200RT rear tire's valve is a bit difficult with the panniers and double brake discs.  This looked like a good buy.Highlights1.  Seems accurate.  I tried several analog and digital gauges on my car, and this was spot on.  I tried it on my bike, and apparently, I need some air!2.  Battery appears to be replaceable, which was the issue with my trusty old one.3.  Handle grip is nice.4.  Huge numerals for those who have poor near vision.The not so highlights1.  It's plastic.  Sure, that makes it light and probably cheap to make, but I suspect that 90 bend is going to be a problem.  You might torque it a bit getting it off the valve stem, which might break it.  But it hasn't broken yet, but I'm concerned.2.  It's hard to read in the dark.  Make that next to impossible.  OK, I could have purchased another version, but I'm just mentioning it.3.  There is no audible beep when it captures the pressure.  But, it's something I'll just have to accept.Overall, for the price, it appears to be a very well designed gauge for a motorcyclist.  Interestingly, I tried it on my car, and the angle precluded me from using it with the numbers facing me.This gauge isn't perfect, but it's pretty nice.  I wish it were all metal, but we'll see if I mess it up.  It's now in my tank bag, always available for use.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.does what its supposed to do. it carry's gas from the tank to the hose then on to the rv.This adapter works, but the clips do not open wide enough to clamp on my battery posts. I was able to attach to the cables coming off the posts, albeit barely adhering.
I spent 4 months in Tucson, Arizona recently and have an 18' A&E awning, the older style you pull out by hand. Had one of these De-Flapper on each end in the middle and it helped keep the awning material from flapping so hard in the wind. Tucson can get some hard winds, and when I was working 55 miles away during the day, I was worried that I'd come back to the park to find my awning flying in the wind. No dice. These work well, but I wouldn't keep them on if the winds get more than gusts of 15 mph. You can see them in person at Wally World first, but order here to avoid taxes!We bought and installed extras of these on our RV, just because the manufacturer never seems to put them in convenient places.  I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them.After purchasing my new Tundra Crewmax and putting a lift on it I found that I could no longer fit in my garage. My driveway is just long enough to fit the truck, so the closer I could get to the garage door I can get the better. After looking around I found this AccuPark. Ordered and received in about two days. Now there is no guess work when parking, and no chance of hitting my garage door. Awesome adhesive, I planned on replacing that right away as most are the cheap 3M crap you can get at Wal-Mart. This is the industrial strength stuff, I would need a hammer and chisel to get it off my driveway.
I don't have the time to write down all of the uses that this product can handle.  I know that it works for what I want it to do.  The down side is that it take 24 hours to fully cure.  Get some!  You will love it.  This price was cheaper than I could buy it locally at the Ace Hwr storeThis is a tough unit and critical to clean the windows of my RV and truck.  I am glad I bought the 'used' one -- couldn't tell it wasn't brand new!  The unit is a little heavy - but that's good for what it does.  I wish I could adjust the angle of the step plate though... right now when mounted it actually is ~10* dropped from level and I would not want to slip off this thing (but the louvers will preclude that from happening I suspect).I am sure this will work fine next fall when I put the bikes to sleep for the winter. I borrowed a can of fogger from a friend of mine for this winter.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech.
I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless.I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
Really cool thing, it is digital so it doesn't matter where you put it, my electric recommended to put it in the middle under console so if someone will try to lift your car it will sense it instantly, because if you put it on one side and the car will be lifted from the other side it might not sense it. But then another electric came and said that it is digital sensor so it doesn't matter where to put it, finally they put it where it was easier for them :) even though I was asking them to put it in a middle as first one recommended in the beginning.And don't worry about parking your car on the hill - it will remember it is position once it is armed and won't trigger alarm, may be old gyroscope based ones were making triggering the alarm.We tested it then, lifted car from the other side and you had to lift your car about 3&#34; before alarm got triggered by this tilt sensor. I was joking that tires are already stolen because for me 3&#34; were to high and expectations were that it will trigger instantly once car lifted more than 1&#34;. But hey, not always you can force your electrics to do what you want them to do.As others have said the pin is a bit long for a 2" receiver but this is easily remedied. To prevent the side-to-side play just get some small O-rings from the dollar store and stack enough on the fixed end. When you slide the pin in you compress the rings slightly to put the lock on. When you let go the O-rings expand and put pressure on the pin and also keep it from rattling.This air deflector makes the air go to the side.  That's all it does.1. There are 2 pieces and no printed instructions - just the box where you can see how to assemble.2.  The 2 pieces fit together by grooves.  Slide and you can adjust by pulling/pushing to get it to fit on vent.3.  Magnets to hold this on vent.  The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later.

These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.While BMW claims the differential oil is a &#34;lifetime&#34; fill, replacing the oil periodically (30 to 50,000 mile intervals) will prolong the life of the drivetrain.  And the Red Line product is the best there is.
this product is great for parking a car in the garage.  Easy to install and see.  i would recommend using additional heavy duty double sided tape to ensure it stays in place.  Be sure to wipe down the concrete with alcohol to eliminate any oil residue on the concrete.I have 2012 expedition,  I recommend everyone to buy this tool. Buy it, get it to the guys replacing your spark plugs to use it. It is great tool to avoid breaking the plug and install it successfully. Great product.If you have never used a clay bar to remove contaminents, this is the one to try. It works exactly as advertised.
Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks.I put a set of these on my Alfa 164 and have been extremely pleased with the performance.  Other standard blades tend to judder and make a lot of noise on the Alfa.  I tried bracketless blades which, besides being ugly, did not work well and left a huge streak of water down the middle.The Valeo's clear my windshield exceptionally well and, just as important, glide like silk with no noise or chatter.  Will see how well they hold up over time but for now they get two thumbs up.used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area. I had 2 little spots approx. 1x2&#34; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top. let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat. It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products. I used &#34;Rost-Egal&#34; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far. You use it once and just know it works. With this very liquid product I am not so sure... It did not even seem to &#34;stick&#34; very well to vertical surfaces. For the next job I will look for a &#34;thicker&#34; product that will cling more to the treated area.
Who would have ever thought to make a clip and trim panel remover like this? There isn't a panel in my car I've failed to remove with this set on my side. I'm afraid that the plastic trim panels in my car would break due to it being a 14 year old car. These are very sturdy and the leverage on this is perfect. It basically fits anywhere.Let me preface by saying if you have deep scratches (catch w/your finger nail) this will help but not do magic.My wonderful mechanic stepped on the bumper of my truck when getting into the engine and it left horrible scratchesfrom his muddy boots. I was sick over it but this cleared it up about 90%.I had another patch on my hood (got truck used so this was already on it) and it looks like someone took a Brillo pad and scrubbed back and forth about 10 times. It was pretty bad and I could almost feel them with my finger nail. The clear coat also appeared to have been removed because in addition to the scratches, the area was very dull (vehicle is dark blue).Well scratch X took about 80% of the damage away and I followed up with meguiars high gloss polish and their carnauba wax. It now looks 95% better and I have to look to see any traces of the scratches and the gloss is back.I did all of this in less than 30 minutes. I also noticed this removed the swirl marks as well.Anyone who rates this stuff poorly is either not doing something right in the application process or is expecting it to do miracles with very deep scratches.ps, I did use a mothers powerball attached to a drill with a combination of hand polishing etcEffective and safe on leather surfaces.  I've tried this product on Honda, BMW and lexus interiors, this stuff cleans without discoloring or damaging surfaces.The best use for this that most people haven't realized is for cleaning leather steering wheels.  After several years you would be surprised the amount of buildup is on a steering wheel.  I had a steering wheel that I thought the leather had fallen apart.  I sprayed the "damaged" area with Zymol Leather Cleaner and let it sit for a minute.  I then went at it with a soft bristled toothbrush and wiped it dry with a microfiber towel.  Lo and behold, what I thought was damaged leather was actually dirt!  Caked on dirt.  After doing the entire wheel and treating with Zymol z509 leather conditioner, the steering wheel looked like new!My only disappointment is that 8oz is not very much.  I used 1/4 of the bottle just cleaning my steering wheel.
Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.Works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower!It even has a lip on the top so the oil won't go out of the funnel.The only problem with funnels is, you never know how full the chamber is,and always need to remove the funnel to look. Someone should invent a meter on the funnel, that helps in overflowing,and an end valve in case the chamber is full, to prevent it from overflowing.But until then, this funnel will do just fine!If you have a high lift jack this is a must have.  You know you will need this in the worst of situations and this will provide better floatation in soft soil and sand.
PROS:Indicator light while charging. Shows when charging is complete.AC power cable.Easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary.Helps digest solids like paper and eliminate odors.Driving tends to send all the stuff flying around and can lead to a stinky travel experience, so be sure to USE PLENTY - more than you think you will need, especially if you will be driving.  And put lots of water in with them so they work correctly.Can never go wrong with slime stuff.Don't put too much in a tire or you will be able to feel it moving around when you ride...a dirt bike...for instance.
This is the only oil I've used in my Harley's for many many years.  It does what it's designed to do and it does it very well.  Great stuff.Very strong and ergonomically pleasing product! I have already used this numerous times this winter and it's excellent. The brush is high quality and the scraper work great. I bet this brush lasts many, many winters.good strong brass bristles, well made, how many words do i need to say it's a good tool!...oh, 1 more lol
This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.Whether you are looking to patch up a hole, or even recreate an entire metal part without casting, JB Weld does it. I use this stuff for computers when I am modding and want a permanent bond. Just equal parts of each tube and a whole world of possibilities opens up!!
Does a fine job. Only had to do it once last season.  We'll see how it works on a full seasonEasy to install!  Does not slip or slide around once installed.  I used this to cover up a worn steering wheel on my Cherokee.  I've been using it for the last 10,000 miles without any complaints.I saw this product recommended on another forum.  Having used Meguiars products over the years I figured I would give this one a shot.  It works well in between full polish / waxings or cleaning up the paint with a clay bar.  Recommend.
I have a 2005 Suzuki C50 Cruiser (700lbs 93") and this cover does cover the bike without its hard bags attached. It does have multi-bars on it, which to are covered.  The bottom half of both tires are exposed.  I am able to connect the front bungee, but the middle one has to attach to the bike frame, as it will not reach to the hole on the opposite side of the bike.It has been raining for the last couple of days, so I plan to go check it out in a few more days, as it is expected to rain through tomorrow.I will adjust my review if there was any issue with wind and/or upper portion of bike getting wet or dusty despite the cover being in place.For now, I do suggest picking this up, as the price-is-right.After years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port, I bought this. Works exactly like it should... by being a barrier between my door and the wall. The thickness is perfect. It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs... but very good nonetheless. Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note: The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured (stucco) wall.Product definitely works as described.  Have used this in the past on all of my vehicles (3 over the last 16 years) and it does a great job of clearing your windshield/windows of rain and misting.During light rains or when the roads are wet and mist is kicked up from the tires on the vehicle in front of you, this does a great job of keeping the beading moving up and off of the windows to the point that you don't really even need your wipers.  In moderate or heavy rains, it does a great job of keeping the water beaded up so vision isn't as reduced as it is on untreated windows.I docked one star though because i've found (thru multiple vehicles and uses) that my wiper blades doesn't seem to last as long after it has been applied.  I've also spoken with multiple friends who reported the same issue.  I haven't used this in conjunction with the RainX wiper blades so maybe that isn't an issue if you use them, but it is def noticeable with other commons brands... From the cheapest ones to the premium ones, it seems to affect the life of them all.That being said, i now only apply to the side windows, moonroof and mirrors of my vehicles. The beading the product causes helps keep the rain off which minimizes water spots as well.  Another plus especially in the spring when pollen is rampant and not washed away with constant &#34;April Showers&#34;.
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.We use K&N filters in our Jet Ski. Having the nut welded on the end really helps removal in the tight confines of the engine compartment.This past summer i took on the project of rebuilding the rear suspension on my daughters Honda so ahead of time i ordered this so I'd have plenty of anti-seize on hand during the reassembly. The brush attached to the lid came in handy for the hub surface that attaches to the brake disc, as I found them rusted together during dissassembly.
The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
I had mixed feeling about this stuff. I sprayed it on rubber seal as directed ( can says very little about product or direction) It foams on the turns to a liquid . Then it starts to run and drip on RV and eventually dries. It did not stain Rv but it was messy as foam turned to liquid.It works like any spray on tire shine on the market you spray on tires. In fact that's what I did with what was left over with 2/3 a can left used it on tires. It went on the turned to liquid and dried to a nice shinny, non sticky clear coating on the RV tires and my cars. I don't know if it will hold up as long or maybe longer then the tire spray I can buy for 4 .00 a can verse this stuff at 12.00 only time will tell. It claims that it has UV inhibitors so that's a good thing to keep tires on RV from cracking from sun. If it lasts a long time on tires then this will last even longer on  rubber seals on Rv and I will change it to  5 stars, But time will only tell!I am hopping it eliminates that annoying rubber squeaking on slide out  when the motorhome is driving down the road and is why I tried it anyway.This polish went on smoothly and evenly and brightened the car's finish.  It does not leave a white residue on the moldings or other rubber parts on the windows, bumpers, and doors.  That makes it highly desirable to me.  As it was used for the first time and just recently, I have no idea how long it will last.  I hope the finish remains as it is for awhile.So far...EXCELLENT~I have been using this product for years.  It's a liquid cream stays emulsified and spreads very easy.  After it dries to a haze it wipes off even easier.  As a cleaner wax it's fantastic.  Removes everything that has accumulated on your paint and leaves it shiny, sealed and smooth.  I use it on our Murano, F150 and camper trailer.  I'll never use anything else.
I used to take my car to the mechanics and they would hook it up to their diagnostic machine. If they diagnosed my car and I didn't use their services, the fee was $50. Otherwise, if I used their services it was a free diagnostic but I had to pay for the repair. Now I can self-diagnose my car and instantly know what is wrong with it before shopping around for the repair. I used the Actron CP9135 today when my air conditioner was not blowing at all. I had forgotten that I purchased this a month ago and I called my husband to ask him if I should take the car to our mechanic. He told me to go home and hook this up and see if it can tell me what is wrong with the air. After a dozen or so tries to get the air on, I went inside and got the Actron CP9135 and hooked it up. I then turned the car on and the air worked fine and no error codes were reported. I am not sure if this is true, but my husband said maybe it reset the cars computer? Who knows, but it did save me a trip to the mechanic and it gives me peace of mind to know what is going on with the car. I am going to keep it in the glove compartment for future problems.Update Dec 20, 2007: My car was shuddering a bit at low speeds and stops. I immediately plugged this in and found out that my 6th cylinder spark plus was not firing. Took it to the mechanic and had my spark plugs replaced. Saved $109 off the dealers "diagnosis fee"!I recently rec'd this unit, charged for a full 20hrs.Just used it to jump start my 2005 G35 coupe, it worked perfectly as I used it twice, checked the status light, appeared to be be able to jump a few more V6 engines before I need to recharge unit.Also, my battery was totally dead, I mean when I turned the key...no lights on the dash, no clicking sounds from the engine...totally drained battery.I might consider buying another unit for my other carEdit: March 26 2013I tried to help my friend who had a 2008 Subaru Legacy 4 cylinder turbo, it failed to start it as he drained his battery when he forgot to turn off the interior map light. I was surprised it failed since it started my V6 G35 which also had a near dead battery. I hope my unit was not good for just one jump??Also, note that I recharge my jump starter after every single use.Reducing rating from 5 STARS to just 3 starsThe battery is brand new and barely used.  I bought a battery tender to keep the battery charged, because of the lack of use.  The Battery Tender Jr topped off the charge within 15 to 30 minutes the first 4 times I used the tender.  Then the fifth time, the tender charge light stayed red.  I phoned Deltran to discuss.  The first person interrupted my first sentence to tell me it takes up to 72 hours to charge.  I tried to tell her how I don't use the battery, and about the 4 previous charges taking only minutes, and suddenly #5 was different, but she kept innterrupting me to lecture me that I had to let her finish talking.  No clue how she could provide usable information, since she didn't let me explain what has happened.  After she went on lecturing excessively about letting her talk, I finally asked for another technician, who was excellent.  I did a couple tests with her on the phone, and, while the indicator light passed the functionality test, it stayed red when connected to the battery.  One thing I learned was that, after two hours, the charger should have been hot, and it was only warm to the touch.--Later:  My brother tested the charger, and it is not giving power.  Battery is fine.  Amz's return policy expired two months after the purchase, so I emailed Deltran to see about getting it replaced.  Haven't heard back yet.
Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust.  Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid.  Will update with results.It is great. I just add it to the reservoir along with the regular washer fluid.  It does work very close to the original spray, so i won't say no to it.  The repellent effects stay on and does the job well. Buy it.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.
What is not to love about a cheap genuine K&N; product?  It fit in my car with zero issues and its K&N; so you know its quality.On a nice side note for the men out there,  K&N; includes a sticker to put on the air box that says the filter is a K&N; product and does not need to be replaced.  I only say this because my wife has had people who change her oil try to sell her a new one.  This was a nice thing to see in the package.  They even include a card to put in the glove box with a 1 800 number for a service station to call if they don&#8217;t believe it!I have always put a K&N; air filter in my car and as long as they are around I always will.  Plus Amazon had them for about 30-50% than other places I looked.I have no issues!I actually have the Sears Craftsman version of this wrench, but down to a detail they are the same wrench. Many of Sears' Craftsman tools are just re-branded tools made by someone else.After reading other reviews, I had high hopes for this wrench. What I found was that after putting it on my ratchet, I barely had room to get it over the end of the filter. I ended up having to use a long-handled non-ratcheting socket wrench with it, which probably resulted in my putting a lot of side-torque on the filter threads.If I were purchasing now, I would look for a wrench that uses the rubber straps. I had a mechanic that I've gone to tell me that over the years, those have been the best and hold up well even when oil gets on them. They are also fairly inexpensive. While I will be able to use this wrench, it was not the "dream" I had hoped for.I received one of these years ago as a gift to clean the spokes on my bike.  It worked great and lasted over a decade.  I also used it on the wheels of my cars.  It really makes quick work of the dirt you can't reach or would spend a lot of time trying to get to.  I just replaced that old one and the new one is identical; very good quality.  Be aware that the core of the brush is a heavy twisted wire that terminates in a loop at the very end of the brush.  Be careful that you don't scratch your wheels with this exposed wire loop.  I personally never had a problem with it but am careful, being aware of the potential for scratches.  If I was designing this I would have coated the end of the wire in rubber. (thus the 4-stars)  I definitely recommend this to those who really like their vehicles clean.
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Got this to replace the stock Thermostat on my 99 Jeep XJ. Stock one is 195 degree, but I like my engine to run a little cooler. Worked great.
Once again, I failed to check Amazon before purchasing this...it was over $20 at Advanced Auto. It is $11 n here as I write this.I have a 2012 FJ Cruiser and it was running a little roughish...and I am super sensitive to any changes in my vehicle. I've put 30k miles on in one year...so it isn't really new anymore. One bottle of this has cleared up whatever was ailing my truck. The dealer couldn't find any issues. I think it was dirty fuel or injectors...this works.I wanted to explain how I decided to purchase this Jump-n-Pack so my review is long Sorry!I have used many Jump Packs & all have worked OK in the past until I purchased a Larger Diesel Truck that is. This truck is a Mitsubishi FE140 with a 4Cyl Turbo Diesel engine. It has two Batteries & we have two inverters, a fridge etc that run of the truck.One day we was shopping but when we returned to the truck no start because we left lights on OOPs. Now the store we were at had a normal Name Brand Jump Pack like you see in most stores. Unfortunately it didn't work at all.So we called roadside Assistance which was to say the least an adventure.1. After over two hours of waiting & mis-communications a nice guy in a Honda that was barely running showed up. I was literally laughing as he pulled up with his little yellow light on the roof. His car was barely running. All he had was a smaller Clore Jump-n-Carry which didn't do any better than the other one we tried earlier. He gave up eventually2. Roadside Assistance Apologized & said they would send a more appropriate vendor to jump our truck.3. Next a truck larger than ours showed up so now Im thinking we are in good hands. Well he had a direct connection plug to use his truck to jump us which did work but not before trying for 30 minutes.So after all this my BoyScout side said I would never be left in this situation again so I researched many Jump Packs on the web. Finally finding the Clore JNC660 which had a few reviews about it jumping even Larger Tractors which have multiple batteries. I decided I had nothing to loose so I purchased it during a Xmas Lightning deal thinking how is this Jump Pack going to work on our truck being this inexpensive. I purchased knowing Amazon would back it up & also thinking I could use it on our boat if nothing else.I also made sure I was getting the newer model based on some reviews saying they didn't receive the updated model. At first all seemed well so I didn't get to test it out since I wasn't going to run batteries down purposely. Finally there was a day it happened the truck didn't start because something ran the batteries down. So I pulled the Jump-n-Pack out thinking I hope this works.First of all it had nice long reach cables which was awesome since all others I have owned or tried had very short cables that required holding the jump pack up over batteries. Next I hooked it up went to cab tried to start & it fired up almost instantly to my amazement.I have now had to use the Jump-n-Pack multiple times on this truck because the Fridge was running batteries down very fast due to defect. The Jump-n-Pack has not failed one time & has had to jump this truck not only once on a charge but 4 times in same day.I know it is It is just a simple Jump Pack but it does the job so well all my vehicles will have one soon.Update 08/19/2013:I have been using this for quite awhile now & it has never let me down yet. I have used it to boost my Fuso Turbo Diesel truck multiple times, Our Land Rover, Lawn Mower as well as our Boat. I will purchase a backup second one when Amazon puts it on sale again.Now there is one negative to mention. After using it quite a few times I have noticed the cables getting skinned from the way it winds them up. I have found you must take extra care to wind it up just right to prevent this from happening.Update 09/12/2013Today Amazon put this on sale again so true to my word I have purchased a second one.I also wanted to add to my review I recently had to replace both batteries on my Truck because they both had dead cells. This is even more testament to this Jumper because it was still able to get my truck running even with two bad batteries that were low on water also.I used this stuff for years in my motorcycle tires and never had a flat in a Slime equipped tire.  I did have two flats (one front, one rear) on a couple of secondary m/c's I had, that did not have Slime in the tires.  That was when I used to change my own tires on the garage floor.  But I have a recent story.  Nowadays . . .Being older and less inclined to wrestle with tire changes myself, I now use a dealer shop to mount my replacement tires. I recently took my Yamaha in for the first rear tire change at 8000 miles.  I had Slime in the tube and the mechanic complained that he couldn't get it to balance and had to install a new clean tube.  OK.  Then . . .2 months and 600 miles later I walked out of a restaurant and there sat my bike on a flat rear tire.  It was a small rusty nail.  And I had not installed Slime in this new tire due to the mechanic caution about balancing.  I got it fixed, but here's my situation nowadays. . .I still am not using Slime pre-installed inside of my tubes. BUT - in my underseat storage compartment, I keep a new 8oz bottle of Slime and a compact 12v air compressor.  I'm going to try from ever again being stranded helpless with a flat.A final comment about running Slime full time, pre-installed.  The manufacturer does not seem to recommend that on highway speed vehicles, and describes Slime as a temporary repair method only.  OK, so that's what I'm doing now, plus preserving my proper tire balance.  However, in my younger more worry-free years I ran tens of thousands of motorcycle miles with Slime pre-installed in my motorcycle tires, and never noticed a balance problem.  I never had a flat either.I'd keep one in the tool kit.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckThis fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket.Easy install on my 2002 Ford F350. I have not had a chance to use them much, but they worked well the few times I have needed to.
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderDid not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car
I bought these for my truck, and my house. We have a window on the sun side. I put these behind our Mini-blinds to stop the Sun. It fit my window well, and blacked out the Sun. Good deal.  SWI put this on my hitch attached to my camper to get room past my spare tire when hauling bikes.  Highly reconned!!It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.I have used this on my dirty nasty greasy jeans and my driveway work Great. It really eats the grease out of the clothing, I dont know if it will eventually eat away at material or weaken the material. I like it for my Driveway it works great at cleaning up those nasty oil spot son asphalt. I would suggest this to anyone especially if you work in a factory and get Hydraulic oil and grease on your personal clothing almost everyday.The product does have a dilution chart on the back I would highly suggest this gets used, its a very strong product.
Bought this to use with an air compressor. I didn't want to risk shorting out a fuse using the compressor in the cigarette lighter in the car.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I used this on my 97 Miata during a complete engine rebuild;The Good;Excellent product, from reports (although not mine personally) one of the best synthetic oils out thereFully SyntheticBottle is easy to use and avoid spills. (I also used a screw-in pump. I recommend you do too)Ships PrimeThe Bad;It can be pricey for what it is.I would use this in any performance car. I do not use it in my Daily Driver (Chevy Suburban with 150k miles)
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.If you want a good shine that will last because you hate waxing your car, then this is for you. I used it and it really did almost last for a year. I would say maybe 6-8 months or so. That is pretty good and close to a year. Be sure that your car is as clean as possible, you may want to use a polish before using this, but you are probably lazy since you hate waxing your car, so you can use this right after your car is washed. If you want to do the once over on your paint, once a year, I would recommend the following: Wash your car using Meguiars Gold Class; it is an excellent shampoo and conditioner for your car. Clay bar your car. The clay bar is probably the easiest product to use. It is almost effortless. You mist a section 18&#34; x 18&#34; with a quick detailer (yes Meguiars has an excellent quick detailer), then you use the clay bar with medium pressure. Make about 10 passes. Then you lightly wipe dry. Your paint will be very slick and you should not feel any grit after using it. Do NOT drop the clay or you may scratch the heck out of your paint.You have to throw it out and use a fresh clay bar. After you have completed the entire car with the clay bar, you can then use a polish. Yes I know Nu finish states that it is a polish, but we will pretend it is a protectant. Use a polish (similar to Meguiars polish - yes I love Meguiars products and no I do not have stock in the company). Then you can apply the Nu finish. One reviewer said to dampen the applicator; that is probably a good idea. Do one section at a time. As with any &#34;protectant products&#34; if you use too much it will be difficult to remove. Since you are going to be doing this once every 6-8 months, take the extra time and effort to do it correctly. After the Nu finish, may I suggest that you use Meguiars NXT 2.0. It is a polymer sealant that works very well. In summary:  Wash, Clay Bar, Polish, Nu Finish, and the optional poly sealant. If you are very lazy you can do your car in 2 steps. Drive it through the expensive car wash, and then use the Nu Finish. Good luck.This blade works great however you need to know a few things.  The ice will destroy it over time if you try and run this + windshield washer fluid in the winter on an uncleared windshield.  If you at using this in the rain/show though it will work great.  Another thing is that you can't use rain-x with this it will cause smearing.
Great tool for measuring your tires, makes it easier to determine if you have uneven wear!  Would recommend this for anyone with a trailer.Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.This product works great as advertised.  Be sure to constantly change or use a clean cloth.I would recommend it without a doubt.
I use this battery tender for my Harley Davidson. With the OEM security system, the Harley can drain a battery quickly, making it a hard start on those cool fall mornings. When we are up north at our lake home, the HD does not have a garage to be placed in, so I will use this  battery tender outside and did not trust using the normal battery tender out side with not protection, so I was using a pail to place over the tender. Now I can use this one without worry.Would purchase again.I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses.As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!  The AC power supply works as advertised but the inverter cooling fan is rather noisy.  You can hear it from one room of the house to the other.  The LED light is smart as LEDs use very little energy.  There are consistent complaints about the air compressor taking forever to inflate a tire.  The problem is not in the air compressor but the little black nipple at the end of the house.  One must, with the lever first up, push the inflation fitting all the way onto the tire valve stem by twisting the fitting and gently pushing until  you can see none of the brass fittings and then push down the lever to connect the hose and open the valve on the valve stem.  If you do this correctly, you will see the actual tire pressure currently in the tire on the air pressure gauge.  If the air hose fitting is not on the valve stem properly, when you turn on the inflator, the air pressure will initially say 0 psi until you turn on the pump and then the pressure will jump up to 100psi.  What is happening in this situation, is that the air compressor is trying to push against a closed valve.  It will VERY SLOWLY push air into the tire.  Make sure you have the fitting right and it will work very quickly.  Black and Decker should put a better air hose fitting on the end of the hose to eliminate this issue.As stated, everything works.  Ultimately, I will use the dc receptacles to charge the device via solar panels through a charge controller.Update as of 9/19/2009I have had this unit for some time now and have been charging it via the 12 volt cigarette lighter with a small 30 watt array using two Sunforce 15watt panels in parallel.  I use a Sunforce 7 amp charge controller to protect the battery in the device. I can easily charge this unit in about 6 hours from a depleted point at which the inverter auto shut off to protect the battery the night before.  I get 5 to 6 hours of light from a standard torche lamp in my living room with a 23 watt cfl installed.  I recently started charging it in parallel with a old jump starter pack I had been given as an anniversary gift at a job. If I am only using 6 hours of the sun, I am not storing all the energy I can.I now run the Electromate in the living room for about 5 hours to power the lamp and the Jump start pack gets a 75 watt inverter plugged into it and I run an identical setup upstairs in my computer room.I want backup power in an emergency and a very good way to get the bugs out is to use it continually so the problems will pop up at I time when I don't really need emergency power, instead of at the most inopportune time.
Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast (received next day) and just got done hooking it up. I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals). I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged. It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling. Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs. The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase.We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews, I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies (even with new battery). Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night, and unplug in the morning before the commute. No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car...  The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger, or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from.I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them)..
Our Battery Tender Plus is on a shelf in the garage, and the RV with its battery is parked outside.  This cable runs from the charger to the wall of the garage, down to and thru a vent hole in the wall, then across the driveway, under the RV, then up front to the battery box.  It turned out to be just long enough.  When we leave on a trip, I turn off the charger, then coil the cable beside the garage till we return.  We no longer worry about fast-charging the battery every month or so during the winter to keep it from freezing.As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!

It took them from near zero to full charge in a bit over 4 hours, topping them off slowly and then automatically shut down... perfect. It's light, easy to use, the cables, clamps and case are robust and should take a lot of use without failure.One other thing of note, if you plug it into a small gas generator, on 4 amp charge it won't even bring the generator off idle. This allows you to charge batteries, and also run household items off the generator at the same time. Perfect for cabin or RV solar systems on rainy cloudy days when the solar panels won't provide enough and no "plug" is available.
I purchased this to store an emergency key in the hitch of my truck when I'm kayaking, hiking, or doing another activity where I can lose my truck key. The device attached within the standard 2" hitch in less than a minute using an ingenious sliding latch system and two steel pins. EXTREMELY secure (somebody would have to cut through the steel hitch and then cut through the steel hitch-safe to get into the contents). Keep in mind, that the "safe" area is very small...not much area to stopre more than a key and some money, but it does what it is supposed to do.After using a star lug wrench for many years, I decided to try the Gorilla telescoping power wrench and I am impressed by the additional power that this wrench seems to have.  There is absolutely more torque with this wrench and I am able to remove lug nuts with less effort than the star wrench that I have used for years.The Gorilla wrench can expand to provide additional leverage needed to remove even the most difficult lug nuts attached to your wheels. The telescoping feature snaps into place and I found that in order to reduce it back to it's normal storing size you must depress the recessed spring button and slightly turn the wrench.  You then just simply push the wrench against a hard surface such as the ground in order to collapse the wrench back to it's compact size. Two additional sockets are included as well as a protective plastic case to store your wrench.  The Gorilla wrench is heavy and is of sound construction and I am very pleased with this purchase.I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.does what its supposed to do. it carry's gas from the tank to the hose then on to the rv.It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet
I will be using this  a lot this winter since I live in a cold climate (Minnesota). I do spend my time ice fishing and snowmobiling in the winter. This will help protect my face from the cold wind. Good buy!I use Sta-Bil for my truck that sits dormant for months at a time.  I also use it on my mother's car that is dormant during the winter months.  I also use it to treat the fuel in my storage containers for my generator and leaf blowers.  I have always had good experiences when I go to start those engines after being dormant for some time, when the fuel is treated with Sta-Bil!I used this on a car put in storage for many months. It started up with no problem. Now I use it in my lawn mower gas year round. I put it in the 2.5 gallon gas can and don't have to worry during the winter.
My 2003 Silverado 1500 5.3 V* owners manual called for a GF626.....This is the EXACT same fit and goes on  easy. Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid...Bought this to replace my old Battery Tender Plus. I have a Yuasa lead acid wet cell battery in my bike, this looks to be a good match for it. The included hook up wiring is good quality, and the unit has a simple to read interface: power on, charging, maintenance mode/trickle charge.Glad that we can purchase a good quality charger for so little money...my BT cost $60.One tip: match the charger to the battery type. Lead acid, AGM, gel, lithium ion, lithium iron phosphate batteries all need specific chargers.First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I have a 2012 BWM f650gs 800cc twin motorcycle.  These Rotax engines make a very annoying fuel injector tick - TICK,TICK,TICK ... sounds like something is horribly wrong.  But, it is normal.  So, I have found that adding a tablespoon of ashless, smokeless 2-stroke oil each tankful, along with about a cup of Techron - that annoying tick is almost gone.  I run this bike hard and it runs great with this formula.  I also use ASL CamGuard in the oil (5% mixture - also on Amazon).I have used this to power a compressor I used to change my break fluid and to put air in my tires. I love this little gadget. I lost a sleeve on one of the negative (black) clips. Still works great but I deducted a star due to the sleeve sliding off. Not a deal breaker by any means.Buy this product. It is very handy.
Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.Honesty look like a toy, really is a toy.This pump is too weak and it doesn't hold almost nothing .If you plan to buy, check another bigger.This is a very heavy duty cord. Probably more than I need, as I only use it to power my porable Fantastic 12v fan, in my motor home, when I dry camp. But, bigger IS better, right ?
My bike came with a Yuasa battery and I"ve heard good things about Yuasa.  So why not buy a charger from the same company that makes your batter??Its nice to have the two types of batter connectors.  I mount the hard-wire kit to my motorcycle and whenever it will sit for a while, i can charge the battery without needing to take off the seat, etc to get to the batter.  Then you also have the alligator clips to use when you need to charge other batteries like lawn equipment.Two things I really like about this controller.First it has storable settings for different trailers. One of the most time consuming things you can do is adjust trailer brakes. With my old controller, ever time I changed trailers, I had to re-adjust the settings. Big Pain! With this one, just adjust and store the settings for each trailer. So much easier! Just hook up the trailer, select it from memory and go! Also works great if you have multiple drivers who prefer different brake settings.Secondly, I really like the different colors you can chose for the display. You can change it for different lighting and eyes. This is handy also because this controller has built in on screen diagnostics! It makes troubleshooting a brake problem while your in Timbuktu so much easier.Oh and I guess I have a third one too... I like the multiple buttons that let me select the main functions without going into some sub-menu maze.It also can be mounted at any front to rear dash angle unlike many others. It comes with two mounting brackets, one for permanent mount and one for quick disconnect so it can be easily moved from one vehicle to another and back again.Oh yes, and their patented brake boost function is just amazing! Stops the trailer much quicker with a great feel.Guess I really like it. I'll never go back to the others...Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.
Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).This is the OEM cabin air filter for the 2006 Acura TL, and trust me: this thing does what it's supposed to do. I couldn't believe how much crud this thing had caught between the B12 service on my girlfriend's 2006 TL.One thing I will say is that this is a PITA to replace. After disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console, pull the console down. Directly down. That means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly... or you'll break a tab and your interior will never be the same. I've seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left. Don't be another.
Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento.does the job.Based upon condition of your wheels, the cleaner does require some elbow scrubbing but does a descent job. Hope this helps.
Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be.This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch.No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM!If you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is, always non-functional.  this conncetor works and holds the flat 4 wire firmly.

In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance.This is very accurate and works well. The battery will last a long time and it fits easily in the glove box. They need to add a pin to the back side to let air out of the tire in case you over fill.3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!

I have an army 6x6, 6 wheel nuts per wheel...each two piece wheel bolted together with 15 nuts at 400 ft/lbs.  A couple wheels had some air leaks, and they need to be disassembled.  It would have been a bear to remove these nuts without the ant-seize.  I use this on every bolt in every application.  Big bolts, little bolts and it does a great job of protecting threads that are exposed to weather.I can save a few cents at WalMart, but then I have to drive 20 miles and fight the crowds to get it.  Not only that, they may not have it.  They usually only stock about 4 of them at a time.  I'm running a small mower/ATV repair shop and this filter fits 75% of everything I work on.  I usually buy 10 or more at a time.Yes, the filter does have paper end caps.  But in a low RPM and low compression engine with small volume oil pumps, I have never seen one fail.  I had four different makes of this same filter several weeks ago and cut them all open.  Every filter was made a bit different.  What I liked about the Fram was that it had larger intake holes and it had twice the number of threads as the other three, Wix, Puralator & John Deere.The filter is just a safety device to catch any errant foreign debris.  If you have metal or dirt in your oil/filter, you have bigger issues.  The key is good oil and regular oil changes.  The filter for the most part just sits there waiting for something bad to happen, the key is the oil, which actually does all of the work.First off, assembly was a breeze.  Had this shipped overnight for a weekend trip.  Amazon Prime membership has it's privileges.  It only cost a few extra dollars.  Still cheaper than any retail store on the planet.Secondly, when I tried to employ this, it was quickly apparent that 60" wa'nt tall enough.  Since I used up all of my leveling blocks to level the 5th wheel, I couldn't use any to raise this up to be tall enough to support my king pin.If this would have had just a couple more inches... every man's dream!Guess I just have to get another stack of leveling blocks.  So 4 Stars for falling short.of my needs first time out.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.
cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grimestellar product for polishing, cleaning and keeping the bike looking great. She works on the engine, paint, fiberglass, plastic, chrome and anything else on the bike. DO BE CAREFUL SPRAYING ON THE SEAT OR TIRES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND. This product doesnt come off too easily and will spread with heat. If you spray on the tires or seat it will look great but your butt and the bike will slide everywhere.This is on wife's truck to keep it charged while on we are vacationfit perfectworks perfectI put dielectric grease on the contacts to keep them corrosion free
I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.I stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by. It stuck to the fabric lining and works very well.The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing.
While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.
Bought this for a spare ... but think I like it for permanent one and keep the other for a spare ... I like the fact you can just use a water hose it you want to drain the grey water ... much easier than the 3&#34; hose when and get it away from where your  waking and don't really need a 3&#34; hose ...I love this funnel, it has so many uses. For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. Let's see a hammer do either of those things. My hammer never stays put. You can reason with this funnel, it has an open mind so to speak. Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel.I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank.  Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon.  But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work.UPDATE:  I was able to actually use this in my generator afterall.  I had to insert the hose at an angle to reach a certain part of the gas tank and it worked like a charm. But, you need to use the up/down motion really really fast to start it off and then it will siphon. I guess it takes a little practice and a little patience. Once you get it right you'll have no problem doing the next time. I keep this in my truck now in case I ever need it.
I have had no problems with the functional use of this connector.  I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.  If you can't find Safari Charlie, I'd recommend trying an electrical contact cleaner or conductive contact grease like what is used on trailer harness connectors.  Any auto parts store should have those.Installed this yesterday. It is a great low tech solution to placing vehicle at exactly the same place every time. I looked at several other options using radio frequencies and lasers. Decided on this option, nothing to go wrong.Others complained of movement of the parking mat. I have not had this installed long enough to evaluate performance concerning slippage. I did carefully clean the area with a powerful solvent before installation as garage floors are likely to have an oily coating. I will update this posting later as necessary.2/17/14I have epoxy paint on my garage floor which could result in the sticky stuff not working. After carefully cleaning the area with a good solvent the mat has not moved. I even hit the rear stop hard to see if it would move. The wife loves it. Highly recommended if installed properly.3/16/14Still exactly where I put it without using any thing other than the supplied double stick tape. Cleaning the installation area carefully is critical. I used lacquer thinner.This was the coolest engine color ever used by a manufacturer. Pontiac used this color from 1966-1970 for both their V8's and straight 6's. Pontiac used other shades of blue through the years, though this blue stands out with the metallic flake. As the previous review notes, apply in thin coats, it goes on a lot easier if you do. You can apply normal coats anywhere there is casting but on flat surfaces you really need to apply light coats.If you're cleaning up or rebuilding a Pontiac motor, there's no law that says you have to paint it the correct blue for the engine/car's year. I'm using this color on a 77' 400, and the motor is going into a 1981 Trans Am!Don't forget to useDupli-Color DE1612 Engine primerfirst! This is especially important on non-course surfaces.Heads Up: Pontiac heads will eventually burn off the paint applied along the exhaust ports. From the past 2 years of car shows I've been to, I haven't seen a single Pontiac where the paint isn't burned off over those ports. The only thing I have seen that did work is someone used a cast iron exhaust manifold higher temp paint along the exhaust runners, which looked as if it was part of the exhaust manifolds. As far as I am concerned, these burned off spots are your tiger's stripes and they belong there if your a serious Pontiac owner!
I would not buy this product again. It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.Decent coverage, easy to install.  Should be a factory installed item to help reduce interior wear.  Easy to install with double sided tape, hopefully this will withstand moisture and other conditions and remain in place.  Being Mopar, I would expect it to do so.
Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.i tested it with another gauge and it gave an accurate reading . Make sure you keep it secure to the valve or it will leak air outAs title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do.
Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletWhat's to say?  It's a container to put your waste oil into.  Has a large Opening to put the oil in/out and a carry handle.  Enough room for me to do 2 oil changes on my Chevy truck since it takes 6 quarts, and this thing can handle 12 quarts.  I don't really see any Negatives to it.  Does what it's suppose to do.
ive gotten one for my car and i didnt feel the difference.i put this one in my 2008 sportsman 500 HO and it digs off the line noticeably faster.i got it so i dont have to buy a new filter every so often, now i have the one and only one ill ever need for the lifetime of the bike and you should tooI bought this in September 2011 on Amazon, and it's still performing flawlessly after more than two years of moderate use.There's already lot's of reviews of this charger, so I'll be brief and to the point.What I like:It's never failed to start a car with a dead battery. Just set it for 200 amps, let it sit for a couple minutes and crank the car up. The cables are generally long enough to accomplish whatever job needs done.What I don't like:Chintzy wheels could be better.Battery tester is basically a joke... it doesn't give an exact voltage and maxes out at 12.7 volts. I'd like to have had an option for timed charge and a sensor that would charge to full capacity and then go to &#34;trickle&#34; mode.I'm giving this charger four stars in spite of its shortcomings because it has worked flawlessly for over two years, and it was reasonably priced when I bought it. I feel comfortable recommending this charger to anyone who need a good battery charger, but would make sure I told them of the weaknesses of this charger.I bought this item because my hydraulic jack was leaking and I always had to top it up everytime I wanted to use it, which alone can take me 15 to 20mins to do.  With this, I just drive up and in a matter of about 2 mins I'm ready to work on my car.  It makes my DIY fluid changes and inspections MUCH easier and quicker.I have a 2005 Mazda 3, and I have absolutely no problems with it sliding, moving, or touching when I drive up on it.Although my car is not even half the weight of the 8000lb capacity model, I bought the 12000lb version just to be on the safe side.I've had this product for just under a year, and I use it every 4 - 5 weeks.  I highly recommend it if you like to save money and do your own oil changes.
My 2003 Silverado 1500 5.3 V* owners manual called for a GF626.....This is the EXACT same fit and goes on  easy. Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid...This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderbought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.
Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.  I typically prefer to go up a size on wipers since it gives a larger clean area.  You can typically go up 2 inches which translates to one inch per side from where the blade attached to the arm.  When the car is dirty, you should be able to see where that extra inch goes - if it hits the top of the trim or other part, you're out of luckWe're using a 28" blade on the drivers side of my wife's Mazda5, and this clears very nicely - no skips or squeaking.  Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier.At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet.This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag.
this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going.The overall length is 16 inches. About 4 inches for the handle. So yes there are plenty of bristles to clean the wheel. Finally, I can clean my Dodge Charger 5 spokes wheels perfectly. It reaches everywhere. And that seller sells it for less than another one on Amazon sold as a "16 inch" brush. Well this one is also 16 inches and it is Prime eligible. I wish I had that brush years ago. Give it a try.This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.
The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
Second one I have bought... That should tell You this is the best Jeep hitch for the money... Extended is the greatest for trailering with outside spare...  Giddy-Up.The K&N HP oil filters are the model of K&N with the 1&#34; nut on the end so that you don't need an oil filter wrench. If you're a DIY person you will appreciate being able to tighten/loosen this in a small space  where it is very hard to get a standard oil filter wrench of any kind. All you need is a 1&#34; wrench. This particular size fits my Miata and the filter is squeezed into a tiny engine cavity where access is very limited. This filter is a breeze to install or remove from above the car. The K&N brand is made by the same company that makes Mobil1 oil filters and that is as good as it gets. I highly recommend this filter for Miata owners and I recommend K&N HP (with the nut) and PS (without the nut) for all vehicles. The quality is excellent and Amazon has the best prices.Although it doesn't look like the real car alarm blinking lights that I have or have seen, it is certainly better than nothing. I purchased one for my nephew along with an inexpensive motion alarm. I highly recommend that you get both for a vechicle that has no alarm. It'd probably be more realistic not to place this device in absolute plain sight. While you want the flashing to be visible, you don't want the would be theives to see that the unit is NOT built into your vehicle. My advice is to get one of these to ward off potential theives, but first you should at least get a wireless motion detector. If you can only afford one or the other, get the real alarm first. The "Wireless Motion Sensor Detector Alarm With 2 REMOTE" by MacTop for $14 + $7 shipping is pretty good. One nice thing is that it also has a red LED light that is always on, even when the alarm is not enabled. That is good for letting people know there is some type of electronic security in the vehicle. Best of luck avoiding the theives.
this product does what it is supposed to do, but, I am not real happy with the quality of construction.Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.This is not the exact same cable that comes with the ScanGauge from LinearLogic, but it does the job. I would buy it again.
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself.3M knows how to make sandpaper. When you get to 2000 grit you're really polishing. I use this prior to polishing something.You'll never go back to conventional wipers after these.  Smooth, no chattering, wipes clean without streaking, and very easy to install.  Note: no snow where I live, so I don't know how they perform in cold climates
This dog bone seems to be well built, the grips are solid and the cable doesn't seem to get hot even when running the a/c.Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed.It's red, it works, and it is hard not to see it when preparing to leave the campsite.  Have used the yellow ones for decades, but the red ones are definately much more eye catching and hard to forget to pull them.
Works as advertised, glass turns out very cleaned, almost even reflective at certain lights/angles.The best way to use this is to apply it like a wax - use one towel to spread it around, and a dry towel to &#34;buff&#34; it. It will show if you don'tUse with mitten and warm to hot water following a good high pressure hose down. Let it sit a minute on surface then wipe with soapy mitten. Hose off. I use very warm to hot water with very little of this concentrated soap. Always wash when your car surface is as cool as you can get it in the warm months. I have shade which works best but not essential.A great product for those who stay in areas / condos where a water hose may not be available. Can be used as a clay lubricant and quick detailer in higher concentration. If your vehicle does not have lot of grime and mud etc which needs to be hosed off this is an ideal product to get. Good for regular cleaning between waxing. Does not strip off wax or sealant. Great water saver. Keep a few microfiber towels handy to dry the vehicle, take care to rinse clean the cloth as you work.
This product over-delivers.  Clean your car very well.  Wash it.  Use a clay bar on it.  When you are ready for it to shine, get this product out.Get yourself a velcro &#34;pad holder&#34; that fits in your palm.  Attached a round 4&#34; pad to the velcro holder.  Apply just 1-3 drops from the jug on the pad.  That is all.  Then do about a 2' x 2' section.  Put it on very lightly.  Oh... DO IT IN THE SHADE!!  This product dries as hard as a rock.  If you put it on heavy, you may get frustrated.  But there is no need.Do one fender at a time.  Put on very lightly.  Wipe off before going to next fender/door whatever.  Just 3 drops will do a whole door.  This product goes a long way.  You have a tendency to put it on heavy to start because you want to &#34;see a haze&#34; to wipe off.  You don't need a heavy haze.  Just a light one.  Then BUFF with a soft double folded cloth.  If you put it on LIGHTLY, it will only take light buffing.  If you mistakenly put it on heavy, you may have a tendency to RUB IT HARDER --- BUT THAT CAUSES SWIRL MARKS from even a soft towel thread.  So If you put it on heavy,let it dry.  Then overspray with a little Quick Detailer spray (any brand you prefer) and then wipe.  The heavy haze comes off.  You can also spray the Quick Detailer on a rag first and then wipe off the haze.  That little bit of moisture prevents you from &#34;muscling&#34; out the haze.RESULTS:  Amazing GLASS LIKE seal over your car like you have never seen!  And, it almost appears as if you had it sprayed with a gloss clear coat.  And, it is a HARD finish.  GLOSSY.  And, it has lasted through 3 months of car washes and dusty roads.  Even a dirty car shines through the dirt with this product.  There may be other products that shine as good, but why shop when this one does it?  I have gone over the Clear Sealant with a Carnuba wax, but it really doesn't feel any smoother.  Just had to try it.  Now I don't need the Carnuba.  I did buy the &#34;ALL IN ONE&#34; Klasse to try.  Seems to be ONE step less than this.it does take a little skill to make sure you dont let it land on any other surface (besides the one your trying to remove 3m from) but honestly it works great. i would recommend this glue remover to anyone who wants to remove decals from there car or remove the glue left over when removed.This bottle won't last long because it takes quite a bit of the product to cover all four wheels. I spray on, use a dedicated brush to scrub the dirty spots and rinse off. Make sure you don't use the same sponge or brush on the rest of your car or else the brake dust will eat your paint.
A well made piece. This brush is not too stiff and the ice scrapper part is located on the opposite side of the handle (convenient if you only need to brush off the show or leaves). Rubberized handle allows for a good, solid grip. Lightweight.The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?First things first...any protection this offers is purely incidental. You are fastening a metal grid to a plastic lens. Duh. But from a style standpoint, it does dress up the tail light assembly. One bar does pass right in front of theback up light which does diminsh its function. Installation is very simple. Directions are clear. The item is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the paint job good. It is a simple way to dress up your ride.
Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them.Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.
I use it for all required applications. A friend that builds engines for a living uses it everywhere it can be.  I have never had a failure of this product.Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug.As many of the reviews already published here have mentioned, this product contains PEA, a very good cleaner. I find the Redline product to be a good balance of a good strong cleaner, as well as a good upper cylinder lubricant. Not to mention Redline has a near bulletproof reputation. I use this product in all of our vehicles which include; 2012 Kia Optima Turbo w/ 6800 miles, 2003 Toyota Corolla with 108K miles, and a 1977 F250. All of these vehicles are very different; an economy car, a turbocharged 274hp 4 cylinder, and a built big block. But they all benefit from using SI-1 regularly.I choose to use this product as a maintenance dose (1.5 ounces per 10 gallons), along with a full bottle cleaning once a year. For $10.95/bottle, it gives me peace of mind knowing the fuel system is being kept in tip top shape. This holds especially true for the Kia, which is turbocharged and direct injection. The Corolla runs as good now with 108,000 miles as when we bought it with 25,000 miles. Still feels like it has the same amount of power and fuel economy has stayed consistent. I attribute this to using synthetic fluids changed at reasonable intervals, and using Redline SI-1 regularly for the fuel system.
This towel works great at drying off my car. I've tried several versions of chamois before and it just has never worked for me, I found that this towel it works best if the water is blown off or taken for a quick drive to allow some water to fly off. I typically use it after a drive thru car wash and the towels does a great job of soaking up whatever is left very quickly and without streaking. It can easily do 10 cars this way before it gets too soaked up. Now I've also used it after washing in my driveway and gotten the towel completely soaked. It worked fine too but did not wring out too well. I would say one towel for one car this way. I'll be ordering a second one soon.After buying this product at walmart, I quickly went home to try it out. I read the back of the bottle first for directions. While reading through the directions I have noticed it said nothing about applying it to a clean dry car. My car had a few water spots on it. I sprayed the detailer liberaly on the surface of the paint. I then used a microfiber cloth to wipe off the excess spray. After I have finished with the whole car, The car looked like it was just washed. Keep in mind that i only used about 1/5 of the bottle. This is a nice product to clean/wash your car quickly without the need of soap and water!!! It also brought extreme water beading to my car's paint!This hose nozzle lets out an amazing amount of water and looks like it could survive a nuclear blast.  I'm extremely impressed with the build quality and the functionality for washing dogs and my car.With my old nozzle, it would take a long time to wash the soap out of my dog's hair.  With this nozzle, the initial gush of water takes almost all of the soap away leaving them squeaky clean.  Same goes for rinsing soap off of my car.It's hard to imagine being excited about a hose nozzle but this thing is awesome.
Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way.

Not this stuff.  I actually added it to RainX Bug Wash the first time.  Then I added it to plain water when I ran the bug wash out.  Both times it left my windshield perfectly waterproof.  Best time to use it is when it's dry.  If you use it when it's raining it'll bounce off the water instead of going into the windshield.  I just spray a splash or two every time I start my car that way it's always ready in case it rains.  And when the thunderstorms come and people are pulling off the side of the road because their wipers can't keep up, you won't barely even need wipers since the rain beads up and runs off.  Perfect product!Seems a bit flimsy but works well .... I always hated leaving the hose in when it topped off and water spewed out I would need to run to the hose to turn it off while it was geyser of water flying out the side of my trailer .... I just wait till its full ... turn the shut-off valve off and I'm good to go wit no mess. Plus having a large valve at the end help with the hose not folding and crimping. For the price it does what it's suppose to do.
After the rain I'd usually have dirt on the sides and on the back.  After doing all 3 steps and going through a day of rain, those pesky black rain drops weren't on the back or splash marks on the side.  the dirt didn't stick.Used after clay bar treatment on brand new car. Wiped on easily, then wiped off easily with little effort. Used on a white car, so tricky to see where I had applied it and removed it (had to depend on reflections). Be sure to dampen the applicator first--MUCH easier. Used a Meguiar's microfiber applicator pad.Used on an FJ Cruiser that offroads a lot. Has held up on the trail very well. Be sure to clean the living hell out of the caliper before applying paint. Also, expect the blue to get fairly dark over time.
If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.
I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered.I have a 5th wheel and I check the tire pressure frequently.  When inflating, it gets to be a chore to air up, remove the chuck and check the pressure.  A constant guessing game:  too much, not enough ... you can never tell.  With this gauge, it get it where I want it first try every try.Nice quality piece of equipment.  Buy one!
This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess.Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank.Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking.
Bought this to use with electrical connections on a tail light assembly for a cargo carrier.  It works as described and was a good price.  This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
Nice to have something other than a standard flat or Phillips head screw if you have a nice plate frame or even a backup camera mounted over your plates. If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket, these screws will most likely be too big to fit. I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in. Ended up with a nice tight fit. Add the little plastic caps for a nice clean look.Cruiser Accessories 82050 Screw Covers, BlackI bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.I took the advice of Vino owners here and on the Yahoo Vino group and ordered one for my scooter. Couldn't be happier. Changing the plug on this scooter is a bit of a pain (it's pretty cramped in there) but the results were worth it. A few tips for to Vino 125 owners: Set aside more time than you think you'll need to replace the plug. Get a plug wrench with a foam insert that hold the plug, or you may end up wasting a lot of time fishing the plug out after you lose it in the plastic housing that surrounds that part of the engine. And have a claw type "pickup tool" handy for when you do drop the plug into the housing. ;-)
I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost.Something as simple as a stethoscope can be the catalyst towards a successful repair or failure.  Comes in handy for noises that you can't find with just a flashlight.

There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.
It worked perfectly to remove the spark plugs. the grip part is left visible when inserted in the spark plug hole, so, you can continue removing or adjusting the spark plug with hand. good tool, right size.As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.
This big strong board is another Camco product for RV's that Amazon offers. It is fantastic, stores out of the way and can be used to clean fish or game outdoors.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many).

This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.Great for a 3" wide receiver for Tacoma or Tundra. It can be hard to find a hitchpin that is for a wider/reinforced receiver. This works well with some small room to spare. Highly recommend.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.
Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommendWorks really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored.Installation was super easy and straight forward. My only complaint is the clear flexible hose that comes with the kit. The hose slips on a barb fittings and it is fastened with a hose clap. The hose clamp isn't tight enough to hold back leaks with spigots that have high water pressure. This doesn't affect the performance of the product its just an annoyance. I plan on replacing the clear tube with PEX tubing that should stop all my leaks.
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes.32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.
I did quite a bit of research before deciding on Dynamat.  There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.  If you have anything to say about my opinions, or would just like to comment on what I have done, please let me know..I thought this might be a bit pricey, in spite of its large size, for a simple chamois.  Boy, was I wrong.  It's thick and substantial and at 2+ feet on a side, very large, almost too large.  But it can hold a ton of water.  Don't mistake it for those small, cheap chamois you get in the tiny auto department of the larger department stores.This is a chamois for people who will use it day in and day out.  I fully expect this one to outlast those others by 4 or 5 times.  If you're the kind of car owner who drapes the chamois behind their head, flips it out flat over a section of sheet metal and then pulls it toward you to get the water off, this one was made for you.If you buy it, you won't regret it.This tool is designed to get behind the lip of a dynamic oil seal, without having to remove the shaft, or disassemble an entire gearbox to be able to drive it out from behind.  It works, by having a thin 'hook' that you can work under the lip of the seal, and then you use the handle to 'lever' it out.As a labor saving device, it works pretty well.However, the hook has to be thin enough, to be able to wiggle between the seal lip, and the shaft, and being that thin, it isn't terribly strong.  There is a reason, a spare hook comes with the tool.I would not classify this, as my tool of choice for seal removal, so much as a special use tool, that you pull out to turn a 2 hour R&R; job, into a 15 minute one, and for that it works well.  The hook is just too delicate for continual use, and will break sooner or later.  I have not priced replacement hooks yet, I still have one good one.  Maybe if they were super cheap, I would rate it 4 stars.  As it is, I have trouble rating it over 3 stars, when I broke the hook on the 3rd or 4th seal I tried it on.  To be fair, I just tried 'levering' it out, and maybe if I was being a little more careful, it might not have happened.
So after reading the great reviews here I bought this item at Wal-Mart and took it home to charge my deep cycle marine batteries.Worked fine for about an hour, then I noticed that it seemed to be stalled at 85% charge.  I did some more internet reading and discovered that this is a common problem with this unit, the readout stalls at a given percentage and never changes unless you unhook it and rehook it to the battery.  I did that and instantly the readout changed to 100%.So now I know for a fact I can never trust my brand new charger to tell me when it's done charging.And worse, despite being 100% charged the unit never switched over to trickle charge.  So despite being billed as a "smart" charger it's just a normal full power charger that will boil your battery dry if you leave it hooked up too long.  Why spend $45 on something that a $10 charger will do?Not only is it junk, the packaging is a complete lie as well.  Now I know and you can bet your sweet cajones I'll never buy a Schumacher anything again.I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi DevilleHaven't used it yet, but i checked that it fits. I hope I can easily get the filter off to do my own changes. They shipped it to APO, which is always a good thing. I bought this because a regular oil filter wrench doesn't work that well on this style of filter.
this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter.I needed a chamois for my car. I got a chamois for my car. A chamois, is a chamois, is a chamois. I needed a chamois for my car. I got a chamois for my car. A chamois, is a chamois, is a chamois.This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price.
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well.I needed a large funnel for adding an ammonia solution to a container for a diesel engine (DEF cannister) and did not want to try to empty a 2.5 gal container of the solution into the engine compartment and having the ammonia all over the place.The Hopkins funnel is large enough that it is an easy target for the liquid being used and it has a grip area so that if you have average size hands it is easy to hold on to it. If you have small hands the design is not going to work particularly well but it can be held by the rear section.
What can i say.  It holds oil.  Multiple oil changes before I have to take it to empty it.  Some people complained about the cap.  Its not the greatest cap in the world, but its ok.  I only use this in my home garage for 2 vehicle oil changes.  Its not that big of a deal for how seldom I use it.  If you are a professional mechanic then you probably have a better solution to hold used oil.Nice little horn for my Harley. LOUD enough to get people to move when they pull out in front of you and decide to go slow, small enough to fit, and nice to look at.Got asked asked a bike meet just the other day "what is that" and he sure got a surprise when I pushed the button lol. This model is completely chrome to look at when installed,  unlike other types that a partially chromed.To use this on a motorcycle you will need to install the included relay for the main power to the horn to prevent damage to your wiring. If I needed to I would definitely buy this horn again, in the first week it has already scared two cagers out of my way that have cut me off by running red lights, who knows it may have even saved my life.I am glad I bought it, but unfortunately due to Amazon raising prices as I put items in my cart it will probably be my last purchase from them. I mean really, I put a $225 item in my cart but when I go to pay for it it goes UP $75? That is just insane.I still use the square aluminum jack stands and I guess it really all depends on the brand you have or something cause these pads needed to be about 1/8&#34; bigger to fit mine so I was not pleased with that though I didn't have anything to block up my tongue when parked so these worked for that I guess. They need to make these things a TINY bit bigger then they can put a picture of a basic jack stand on the front .... till they do it;s really false advertising cause they do not fit either sets of my regular square aluminum jack stands.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicelyPurchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.
Nice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps.Works well if you have the right application...makes sure you can &#34;use&#34; it based on where your filter is otherwise it may not be as handy...This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.
While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.
Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast (received next day) and just got done hooking it up. I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals). I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged. It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling. Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs. The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase.I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them)..This is my second booster pack, they sell another one not as powerful but for roughly $25, you get a stronger one.First off, for the negative reviews, I would ignore them.  It plainly says on the box to fully charge it soon as you buy the product and then to fully charge it again at least once every three months.This thing has saved me from trouble many times.  We have one vehicle that has a persistent dead battery, this thing literally boosted the big V8 mercedes from being completely dead to starting IMMEDIATELY.  Even with jumper cables its a few minutes wait and a tough time starting, not with this thing.  And to top it off, used it daily for 3 weeks and it worked every time ON A SINGLE CHARGE!!This is the same product you will see your mechanic shop using, your body shop, your road side assistance guy, the junk yard, basically everywhere, because its SMALL so it fits in any car.  Good clamps.I highly suggest buying one especially over jumper cables.  A good set of jumper cables will cost you $50, but spend the extra and you don't have to worry about finding another car and going through all the trouble aligning the cars properly.Plus, you can leave this thing plugged in and not worry about it over charging and ruining anything.
excellent price and how much easier it was to install, just get the right wrench and you're ready to go,  Easy to replace also.excellent grease gun! easy to load, easy to use and the longer hose is great!I bought this to go on the back of our camper bumper.  Very well built and easy to install.  Easy to adjust if needed.  Highly recommend!!!!
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...Well built meter that functions just as it should.  The dials are easy to read and as far as I can tell the meter is accurate.This product is advertised as Chrome and is Plastic, and not worth the time or the money. They are cheap and do not stay together!
I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.I used this to change the plugs in my F-150. You can get away with a extension and socket but this is the right size to not be to long or two short.All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckExact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.
California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.Armor All tire shine does a great job.  I use it on two vehicles tires, a Malibu and Chev 2500 Pickup.  Lasts a couple of weeks, unless it rains of course.  I get 3 to 4 all tire shines per can.  Recommend!
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I got this an an extra after i Damaged the original and as expected it is a perfect fit!.  Good to have a spare sometimes!!!!.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.
Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
After seeing other reviews critical of the flow, I agree. And then I drilled it out with a 5/16" drill. I had no need for selecting On/Off/Hose/Tank, so I leave it in the drilled-out Tank position. Now it flows much faster, but I have to use an external shutoff valve I got from a DIY store.I have mine connected to my key chain so that no matter what vehicle I am in I always have it with me.That way I have it in rental cars or when I ride with friends.Inexpensive safety should the 'bad thing' happen.I have an 03 Subaru Outback with 193K miles and I have had orginal equipment and exotic bulbs... including PIAA but I have found these bulbs to have the longest lifespan and function of any I have tried... for more than ten times the price.  They WORK
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.
Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceSure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.
If you are adjusting headlights on a Ford with 4mm adjusting screws this tool is a must. The review that states that the screw moves out enough to keep you from removing the tool from the end of the screw is questionable however. On all the  headlights I have seen, the adjustment on the light moves in and out and the screw dose not, so If you can get the tool on, you will always be able to get it off. Tool is well made and the infinite ratchet is handy. Should last a lifetime even though the vehicle will not. All mechanics I know have one and Amazon is the cheapest. I ordered one that said it was used, in good condition, for ten bucks. When it arrived, it was on the original blister pack, unopened. This is not always the case, but this time, it was. If you are thinking of buying one of these tools, do it.I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).I have many quality tools. I purchased this "Power Wrench" so I can put back the "name brand" breaker bars and sockets back into my tool cabinet. I chose this product bc it has both lug sizes that I needed to simplify tires changes between the factory wheels and aftermarket wheels as they use different size lugs. I do like the fact that the sockets are indeed 6 point and thin wall. But: I`m dissatisfied with the way the wrench locks into the extended range, the quality of the sockets and extension themselves beside the storage pouch that was included. In my order, the plastic package was cut in several locations, also cutting the cheaply made storage pouch. IMHO The storage pouch won`t last long at all.Now that I have the Power Wrench, I`m just going to keep this and chalk it up to lifes experience. If anyone is looking for a breaker bar and socket to simplfy their tire change, simply look elsewhere. I`m sure for the money spent you could pick up a cheap set up for less. I gave this a 3 star rating bc it is adequate and will do the job as intended, hopefully. Also IMHO if you are looking to give this as a gift, simply "PASS" and give your Gearhead loved ones a gift card to their favorite tool place.
Convenient, easy to store when not in use and I know where to find it. Also quality heat shrink non-adhesive.This thing works great.  I use it to exhaust when I cook inside to keep the camper from smelling like bacon.  Also use the thermostat for when I'm out of the camper so it kicks on and keeps the inside from getting really hot during the day, works good at night because it will shut off when the temp drops and you don't have to get up freezing and shut it off.Two cars and motorcycle plus one in garage for my compressor refills.  Bought this one on faith because so many liked this Michelin.  Getting a good seal on valve most immportant and accuracy of course.  This one seals easiest.  That is the best feature.  Tenths of one PSI is also handy if measuring cold tire.  Bulk weight and size less handy if in glove compartment?  Lots of other things in there.I keep this one in garage.  For me with three vehicles and ten tires the pressure memory not helpful.  The light might be nice.  Weight and bulk in my XL hand feels perfect when pressing on tire valve.  That is what the weight is there for?#####  Please let me suggest something for those who get their oil changed at those "quickie" places.  Part of their service is to check you tire pressure.  That is VERY BAD FOR YOUR TIRES.  You have to drive there for the oil change.  Your tires likely warmed up.They decided tire pressure was too high and LET AIR OUT.  Finally noticed tire profile looked low.  Shocked to see almost ten pounds low when cold.  Damn!  That is damaging if driven on freeway for long miles.  Overheats tire and wears faster.Tire pressure should always be check when cold.  Yes it will go higher with driving.  That is taken into account when manufacturer or car manu. recommends pressure setting.  No matter how high when hot ALWAYS CHECK PRESSURE WHEN COLD.  Jiffee Lube and others have good intentions (I hope) BUT tell them NOT TO CHANGE THE TIRE PRESSURE with WARM OR HOT TIRES.  ............and that's the truth, LOL
Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection.This product selling on amazon is the best price you can get. selling on others websites more expensive...I use for holding my motorcycle on trailer... its necessary!!!I think meguiars is the best product for the price on the market today, you cant go wrong with all of the items they sell just read the directions first.
This little converter is a good deal for the price and will pull the current rating listed on it! So that's why I rated it a 5 star.The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.I purchased this wheel lock punch for my newly acquired OEM wheel locks i purchased from Amazon. The only thing i hate about this pouch is that it is not made of the material depicted in the picture. It is made out of Nylon.
the product is very easy to use all you have to do is follow the directions and that's about it it will do the rest as it sayThe SG does all it's advertisd to do very well. Using the programable functions requires some effort. I'm glad I have it but haven't gone much beyond basics.As others have noted, the picture shows it to be MUCH darker than it really is.  It does help tone down my state-issued YELLOW plate though, so it serves its purpose somewhat.
A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanksIt is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy again
I just got this today, I was amazed the base is perfect for the HI Lift jack, it is a lot bigger than picture shows (12&#34; x 14&#34;) I would highly recommend getting this, it could save your life, or prevent injuries using an unstable jack. &#34;This should come with the jack&#34;. Will last longer than a piece of wood, and is easy to clean.I have to admit when I opened the packaging I was surprised.  The quality of this item was above what was expected.  Heavy duty rigid plastic.  A pleasant surprise.  On the trailer end fitting ... there are 4 dog-ear catches rather than the 2 shown in the product photo.  An &#34;ear&#34; breaking off a 2-eared latch was why I had to buy a replacement.  The added end - allows you to use your drain hose for an extension is also great.  Two good quality hose clamps.  In summary, it is very nice to open a package and find an item whose quality exceeds what you expected.  I would recommend this item.  Oh, shipping.  Ordered Monday.  Have it in hand Wednesday.  Go Amazon!This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.Motion Pro Cable LuberThe latest version of this tool has TWO thumb screws.I purchased this tool because it was recommended as a basic tool for maintaining your motorcycle or any other vehicle/device that uses cables. Well, after talking to some experienced riders, they all exclaimed that lubricating the cable (clutch or throttle) is a good idea, but they generally have never done this in over 20-30 years. Looking at the latest motorcycles, the cables don't really allow you to lubricate them using this tool or any tool for that matter. On my Ducati, there are rubber boots that prevent you from injecting lube into the sheath assuming you can use the tool and reach the sheath. On my Ford, the throttle cable sheath isn't thick enough to form a tight seal with the Motion Pro tool. It almost seems like the OEMs don't want you to lubricate the cables. On top of it, modern cars and the latest motorcycles use drive-by-wire which is totally electronic where your throttle input (pedal or twist grip) is connected to a potentiometer that tells the computer your desired throttle angle/input, and it activates a stepper motor that opens/closes the throttle plates accordingly. So if you're interested in maintaining your new bike or car with this tool, you might want to reconsider buying the tool.If you have a vehicle that uses cables and has a sheath that is accessible and large enough to form a seal, this tool is very easy to use and well made. Just slide the cable through the slit, push the tool up against the sheath entrance, clamp down the screws, and insert your lubricant nozzle/tube into the open port. Then use rags to seal the tool and the exit of the cable sheath, and squirt away.Overall: 4/5 stars, the rubber seal could have been designed to accommodate really skinny cable sheaths. Newer bikes and cars don't need/can't use this tool.
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless.Used this to replace the stock intake tube on a 2004 Tahoe 5.3L V8. In conjunction with a K&N panel filter it has added a nice distant intake rumble at higher RPMs without being noticeable while cruising along. There was a small power gain which I noticed at lower RPMs where the transmission would normally downshift it can now pull a little harder from higher gears (overdrive, etc). It also freed up room under the hood which makes accessing the accessory belts easier.
I ordered this product to jump my second vehicle -- which due to the bad economy my wife and I are storing in the garage to save on insurance and also state license fees. However I want to keep the car in run-ready condition, so I try to start it every couple weeks or so. But I usually forget a time or two and the battery dies.That was the incentive behind my purchase of the Jump N Carry. And I can tell you it is a perfect little device. Not very big (and not terribly heavy), it's very easy to clamp onto your car battery. So far my car has started on the first attempt (been used twice now).When not jumping my stored car, we keep the Jump N Carry in the trunk of our main car -- just in case we need it or some other motorist needs a jump.I recommend this product.EDIT: March 16, 2011After one full year in the trunk, I just tested the battery and it's at 75 percent. Impressive! The only product feature I see now would be helpful would be to have the plug to charge this unit built-in. It's an extra charger -- and I've seem to have misplaced it. A retractable plug would be perfect.I put this fluid in my 2004 Hyundai Tiburon against the recommendation of AAMCO transmission service.  I was looking at servicing my transmission and asked if they would flush this fluid into my system.  The guy I talked to tried to tell me that this was a "trick" fluid and that my car would shift very hard and it was not recommended for my car.I went against his word based on the reviews of amazon, recommendations by royal purple, and my own intuition based on product specifications.  After changing my fluid to Royal Purple I can say that this has made a phenomenal difference in my car's shifting.  My car was not as smooth as it is now when I bought it new 95,000 miles ago.  I without a doubt would put it in my car again and will be changing in another 4 quarters in the next 30,000 miles.  My car has always been a little choppy shifting since it is only a 4 speed, but with royal purple I can't even feel it shift.  To think that AAMCO told me it would make my car shift hard infuriates me.I highly recommend this fluid for your vehicle if it meets specifications.Update:For anyone wondering, my transmission is still functioning perfectly fine.  I haven't seen any decrease in shifting since March.  Everything is just as good as when I wrote the review. I took a peak at my fluid a few days ago and it still looks and smells perfect.  I still highly recommend it.Update #2:Still rolling around with this fluid in.  It's been over a year and a half and I drive a lot. The older my car gets the harder I am on it which is exactly what I shouldn't be doing, but it's not a baby anymore.  Still 0 problems even when dropping from 7k rpm. I'm confident my car is going to last forever with RP.I thought this sounded like a handy item to have in my car for emergencies, so when the Amazon Vine program offered it for review, I ordered it.  First of all, it's cheap plastic and made in China.  That alone will usually put me off of buying an item I see in a store.I inserted the included batteries and turned it on.  It emits a red light that can either blink or remain static.  I thought the light seemed small and feeble, but I waited until nighttime to give it a real test.  I set it on my car with the magnetic end holding it to the hood and walked down the driveway to see it from a distance.  Although the red light was visible, it wasn't nearly bright enough to be used as a flare in a roadside emergency.  It wasn't even as bright or eyecatching as the lights you see on bicycle riders at night.I would never rely on this product to warn oncoming cars of a breakdown.  Nobody would know what it was even if they saw it in time to react.  I'm sticking with real flares, which are visible from far away and instantly tell other drivers of an accident or hazard ahead.I hope nobody decides to use this product as a "safety flare" in their cars!  I won't even keep it in my car as a "map light" as they suggest on the package.  I'll rely on the small mag light I already have in the car.
With the fine threading it may be stronger but doubt that this feature will make a difference. The split washer is chrome plated which is a mistake as the chroming weakens the washer and a piece off the end cracked off when I first attached the ball to a hitch.The directions state that the nut should be torqued to 450 ft. lbs. which is likely to be an error. Hard to even find a torque wrench that goes up to 450 foot lbs. much less someone who could tighten the nut to that specification without a 4 foot cheater bar.Ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was 3" diameter but it did not fit, it was just sitting on top loosely.  So I'm giving it 3 stars, if it fits your application, I'd imagine it would be rated highly.  So it's back to either a puck or wood for me.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.
It finally warmed up enough to apply this stuff.  It works poorly on my older rear window. I will try again applying it after washing the glass with ammonia. Sometimes a high pH surface allows the coating to stick better.  One  off for quality, one off for price.I stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by. It stuck to the fabric lining and works very well.This is heay gauge,and heavy duty!I use this to connect up to my 1150 cca diehard marine battery.With the battery tender,Cigarette socket installed,I then plug in my ARB Cooler,load up and head out.With the pre installed 75a fuse it won't fail,never does!
does its job, durable, CHEAP!!!its only 4 star review said they wished it snapped, or clicked, but its a tight, snug fit, u can tell its not going anywhere.all my lights work perfect, dont question it, buy it, u wont regret.What can I say the title says it all, it works as described.  The construction is good, but nothing to write home about.  3.5 stars if I had to give it an overall rating.  In all honesty not quite a 4 stars on this one.this product does what it is supposed to do, but, I am not real happy with the quality of construction.
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.It's an extension cord.  It does the job and is quality made.  4 stars only because it's a bit pricy for what it is.Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project.K&N; have apparently moved their production to Mexico. Older filters of this same type have been made in the U.S.A. I don't immediately notice any quality difference, and the "Mexican" types are sealed in cellophane inside the cardboard box.  This is good, because in a humid environment, if you stock up the shelf of the garage like I do, small traces of surface rust can form on unprotected threads.  I have one of the U.S.A. ones left, and I'll open this one up to more fully compare gaskets, construction, and measurements between the two. Will update.Note: Avoid the "PS" series of K&N.; Inferior quality, not worth the slight price difference.----UPDATE----The center threaded disc that spins onto the post of your vehicle's filter mount has some glue or sealant in the transition between the disc and the rest of the filter's base. I cleaned it off, but am a little disappointed, since the stuff could have come off on its own and circulated through the engine. Maybe it would eventually be caught by the filter, or maybe the particles would just lodge somewhere in the engine.  Not good.  Never saw this on the U.S.A. made filters, and the company had better keep a tight handle on quality control in case other manufacturing issues turn up.This problem is not serious enough to downgrade my initial 4-star rating.This was the coolest engine color ever used by a manufacturer. Pontiac used this color from 1966-1970 for both their V8's and straight 6's. Pontiac used other shades of blue through the years, though this blue stands out with the metallic flake. As the previous review notes, apply in thin coats, it goes on a lot easier if you do. You can apply normal coats anywhere there is casting but on flat surfaces you really need to apply light coats.If you're cleaning up or rebuilding a Pontiac motor, there's no law that says you have to paint it the correct blue for the engine/car's year. I'm using this color on a 77' 400, and the motor is going into a 1981 Trans Am!Don't forget to useDupli-Color DE1612 Engine primerfirst! This is especially important on non-course surfaces.Heads Up: Pontiac heads will eventually burn off the paint applied along the exhaust ports. From the past 2 years of car shows I've been to, I haven't seen a single Pontiac where the paint isn't burned off over those ports. The only thing I have seen that did work is someone used a cast iron exhaust manifold higher temp paint along the exhaust runners, which looked as if it was part of the exhaust manifolds. As far as I am concerned, these burned off spots are your tiger's stripes and they belong there if your a serious Pontiac owner!
It's been three years since I last applied this to my '08 Avalanche, and my black trim was burned up, faded with a white film and looked  really shabby.  After washing and drying, and applying Mother's back to black I am thoroughly satisfied.  Mothers did a great job restoring my trim back to black.My trim was very dry and It absorbed so much product that I used the whole bottle and didn't get to the mud flaps and the running boards (which were not as bad as the trim around the bed and cab of the truck). A couple of things impressed me, it really evened out the blemishes and brought all the trim to a consistent black color.  This was extremely evident around the bed of the truck where part of flat areas are expose and some flats areas are protected by deck lids (on the various compartments), which when opened revealed a sharp line between the two areas.  After applying back to black you could not tell the difference, the trim was even in color and shine. It looked brand new...  Impressive, indeed.But just to say out loud, it's important to work back to black into the sun baked dry parts.  if it is really dry, like mine was, you may have to hit it several times.  That's the key, get the rag saturated with the product and keep working it in until the trim cannot absorb any more.  Once you've reached that point, go back with a clean dry towel and wipe off the excess and buff it so that the shine is in the trim and not from the excess product on the trim.  Don't go by sight, feel the trim with your hand until there is no excess product on it... keep drying and buffing until the trim shines on its own.  If you don't, you'll get streaking. If you do, you won't regret it.I have a 1998 Ram pickup that spends its entire life outside, parked near trees.  I hadn't done much with paint care for more than a couple years and one side was covered in small, hard, brown tree sap spots.  Reading the reviews on Amazon (and other websites) for clay bars and their use in cleaning up paint surfaces, I thought I'd try this Mother's kit to revitalize my paint job.  I was sceptical about its abilities to do anything other than a final "fine cleaning".  I was right.The clay bar could not remove any of the hard tree sap marks.  It does not remove scratches (and can actually apply some if you do not keep the clay lubricated.  It does make the paint seem smoother to the touch, but I cannot tell the difference between a final normally waxed and polished surface and a clayed waxed and polished surface.  The surface feel of unpolished paint Vs clayed paint does exhibit a noticeable benefit from claying, as the makers claim.  However, applying a good polish achieves the same results on a washed and clean paint surface, in my opinion.  Even on my truck, after cleaning it first, the clay stayed pretty clean and only after doing the whole vehicle paint surface did the clay feel faintly gritty and appear slightly darker in color - ready for trashing.To remove the sap, I resorted to a rag soaked in mineral spirits and plenty of elbow grease.  To eliminate any light scratches, I used T-Cut.  Then I clayed it, followed by polishing with Turtle Wax.  After a day of that, my shoulders ached bad, but the truck paintwork looks good; well, as good as an 11 year old, well-used, stone-chipped and scratched truck can.  The clearcoat has actually held up exceedingly well over the years.I haven't tried clay on our 3 year old, garaged minivan yet.  It will be interesting to see if it removes minor swirl marks.  I don't expect it to make the paint look any shinier after polishing. It looks great as it is.I did buy an extra bottle of detailing spray (I bought the kit locally at Autozone) in case one wasn't enough.  But one was enough for one clay bar / one vehicle treatment.  Since there are two clay bars in the kit, then the extra bottle will be used with the second bar.I found the claying to be easy and quite quick.  I split the bar in two, then pressed it flat into a disc about 2" in diameter.  Then I sprayed the surface and rubbed the clay back and forth over the paint in my palm.  Knead it regularly back into the 2" disc, as it gets thinner and splits.  It was actually very straightforward and no big deal.  Avoid rubber parts, like the windshield surround, as the clay picked up black "soot" from those.  Make sure you polish it dry as the spray leaves streaks if you don't remove it with the supplied towelI suggest clay bars are really for the guys and gals that want the ultimate care for their newer vehicles.  It may not be noticed by anyone else, but it's the satisfaction of a job well done that always matters to the perfectionist!  I know 'cos I am one!Sept 26 2009 UPDATE:  This evening, I tried claying half the hood of my minivan then waxing it all to see if I could tell any difference.  The clearcoat on the van is in great condition.  I washed the hood and dried it.  Then I clayed the left half (LH as seated in the van).  I did notice that even with plenty of spray lubricant there were a few faint straight line, light scratches visible in the clearcoat after I wiped the surface dry that weren't there before claying.  I could not feel any real difference in the surface smoothness from the clayed to the unclayed side. The clay appeared to have no visible dirt in it.  I then Turtle Wax'd the whole hood.  After that, the straight line scratches were gone and there was no VISUAL difference from clayed to unclayed even with the reflected overhead flourescent light from my garage as a guide.  I then applied my dry finger tips to the hood; left hand on the unclayed side and right hand on the clayed side.  Applying a light pressure and sliding back and forth, I think I detected a slight reduction in friction as the fingers change direction on the clayed side.  Even swapping hands over, the result seemed the same, ruling out differences in my finger tips!  However, the effect was so slight that it was almost imperceptible.CONCLUSION:  Claying may help with a contaminated paint surface to remove those last little imperfections and revive the paint, but with a clean and regularly-waxed paint surface, claying probably isn't worth the cost nor the effort.I recently put this through the paces on my car.First, I used it with a foam gun just to get the loose dirt off and initial impressions were very nice!  It covered the car with a nice sudsy coating (not SUPER sudsy, but more than a budget car wash liquid) and smelled like bubble gum!  However, the suds disappeared quickly, almost TOO quickly.  Made me a bit worried.  But I moved on to the hand wash.Poured some in a bucket, filled it up with water, and as expected, LOTS of suds, but they seemed to die down very quickly... After the rinsing off the soap and drying the car though, this is where the car wash liquid REALLY shines (bad puns are bad).In the sun, the paint was deep, reflective, and it just looked CONSIDERABLY cleaner than before.  It looked like a whole new depth was added to the paint.  Coming fromMeguiar's Wash and Wax - 48 oz., this car wash liquid takes the cake in final finish and cleaning ability.  However, I think the Meguiar's takes the trophy home for best smelling (to me), most suds, and longest lasting suds.  The Mothers left an awesome finish and kept water spots away when drying, but the bubblegum smell was nearly non-existent and the suds were worrying at first.I would consider Mothers California Gold as a nice start to a full-on DIY detailing job (or even just a quick, light detailing job).  It gives a nice base to work off of.  It seems to clean dirt off more effectively than Meguiar's (tested by clay bar) and leaves a nice, smooth finish, giving you a bit more peace-of-mind.However, if you are short on time and would rather just give it a quick wash, consider the Meguiar's.  It'll give you a one-two combo of a wash that's ever so slightly less shiny and will coat it with a (very) light wax.Sum:- Good: Smells like bubble gum, leaves a deep finish (whole new depth - especially on darker colors!), keeps water spots from forming while drying, cleaning ability is awesome!- Not-So-Good: Suds are a bit disappointing, scent isn't as defined or noticeable once rinsed off.Recommended!
I love this tire gauge. It's cheap, accurate and easy to use. The angle of the gauge is perfect for easily pushing it onto the valve stem and it has a nice little area to put your thumb on to apply pressure.One thing I will note is that you have to hold the gauge on the stem for a couple seconds before it will register a reading. This was not something I was used to and kept popping it off too early only to get a zero reading. At first I thought it was defective until I finally decided to read the directions (I know, but seriously, for a tire gauge?). So yeah, read the directions first :) I try never to be one of those reviewers that hastily returns and gives a 1-star review to a product when it's not the product that is defective, it's the reviewer.I used Mothers California Gold Clay Bar to clean my car's paint before using DA polisher.  I washed my car two times and then used Mother's clay bar.  Even after two washes, when I ran my hand on the paint to feel the surface before and after claying I could feel the difference.  After claying the paint was appreciably smoother.The application was very easy - just spray the included solution and slide the bar on the paint, knead the clay when it smudges appear.  The box warns that if the bar is dropped it has to be discarded, so I was mindful of not dropping it and I did not.  It was quite easy to hold and use.The only thing I did not like about this product is that the solution smelled like cinnamon.  I am not a fan of cinnamon and that smell is unpleasant to me.Overall, this is a great product.The product was very good at cleaning the wheels and tires, and in some scenarios I had to use a tire brush for the tougher stains. But it did its job. However you can run out of wheel cleaner in these bottles relatively quickly, because the product is highly compressed into that one bottle. I don't know why but sometimes it would be hard to pull the trigger, where I had cramps. The trigger resists, where at first applying the product was moderately easy for fresh hands. But after a while, it means ow. Oh well, the product did it was supposed to, I applied protectant after, so happy day.
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.
This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand. The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn. The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer. Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.  I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle. I probably won't have to use it ever again. In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount.I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products.The Lexol pH cleaner worked extremely well to clean automotive leather upholstery and surfaces. Just follow the instructions on the bottle and it does a fantastic job. Always use the pH cleaner before you apply the Lexol conditioner since you don't want to apply new oils over existing dirt. The pH cleaner comes out as a clear liquid that is more viscous than water. I recommend using a terry cloth sponge to create more lather than just using a cotton cloth or terry cloth. I have tried several over the counter leather cleaner/conditioners and Lexol beats them all.Pros: Cleans leather without drying it. Very easy to use.Cons: The product is a bit expensive and hard to find compared to the over-the-counter products, but it should be the only product to buy and Amazon carries it!Overall: If you own any leather accessories or cars with leather interiors, Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditioner should be on your list.
I found that it was hard to find this color.  I have used this product line for other cars.  The match has always been perfect.I have been using the Meguiar's NXT wax for years.  A few friends recommended this product and I am very satisfied! No need to spend the extra $$$ on NXT.It's the second time, I've used this product on my Mitsubishi Eclipse v6 5sp. I highly recommend it for everyone to use it.
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).Run this in a daily driver to make it last longer (I use 8 or even 10-12 oz in my 2005 Lincoln Town Car at each fill-up) and overall smoother engine response.Run it in an older car or dirtier engine to clean out a lot of old deposits (the bad deposits, not the varnish that HELPS lubricatethe engine).  Might see a small increase in MPG in that scenario.Here's a helpful tip: as the instructions indicate, you may replace up to 20% of your motor oil with this.I ran a quart of it in the Lincoln with new (but cheap) 5W-20 motor oil and a cheap filter (the Fram Orange Can of Death ExtraGuard isfine for this purpose) for 2 weeks and then changed the oil & filter back to the really good Motorcraft FL-820S and synthetic oilI normally used.  I say that's just as useful as a SeaFoam treatment or any of the so-called engine"flush" treatments, whichmost cars don't need unless they've been mistreated for years.  Worked well in my car which as as smooth-running as one couldhope for at about 114,000 miles and 8 years old.  Look inside under the oil fill cap and everything shines nicely.And as always use 4 oz per 10 gallons (or so, I actually use a bit more but that's just me talking) in the fuel at every fill up -- addit BEFORE filling up for best possible mixing.  But after is all right as well, better then than never.
After a few cycles using the HD SYN3 oil, I decided to change my own oil and use this Mobil 1 in the engine.  Having never been satisfied with the "just after the oil change feeling" with SYN3, there was a noticeable improvement in engine smoothness and reduction in engine noise during the next 2,500 miles I kept this oil in the bike.  These are things you notice when you become connected to your bike, as you fellow bikers know.  I have used Mobil 1 since because of this experience and because I can get it from Amazon cheap.  It's probably not as good as AIMSOIL, but it's very good and I'm confident it's doing a great job.I have not used this spray gun yet but, after inspecting it closely, it seems to be a well constructed sprayer especially for a novice such as myself whose painting experience has been limited to brush, roller and spray can. It appears that it would be ideal for fences, outdoor furniture, etc. After using this item, I will come back to edit/update this review. I would like to add that this order was promptly shipped and very well packaged for a safe transport to me. At this point, I would recommend this item but, with the notation that I will review it further after using it.I like the ergonomics and bright display of this tire gauge but I can't comment on its accuracy (as I don't have a standard with which to test it) or its longevity as I've only owned it for about a month.  It seems to do a very good job of not letting out excessive amounts of air when connecting or disconnecting to/from a valve stem.  I have used Accutire products in the past and never had any issues so I'm hoping this one holds true to form.  BTW- I bought this to replace a Slime tire gauge which was absolute junk; I'll never buy another product from Slime.
I use it for all required applications. A friend that builds engines for a living uses it everywhere it can be.  I have never had a failure of this product.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!We do not use this as a cutting board, we only use it for extra counter top space in our camper.  It stays in place on our camper stove while we travel.  It was a great purchase.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.
Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersI have the old battery tender and can tell a difference when using this newer model on my BMW motorcyle gel battery .  Much better, longer charge.Thank you.I now have 4 Battery Tenders, this being my 2nd Battery Tender Jr.  I use the larger models for 2 cars I store each winter, and I use the Jr. models for my generator and my lawn tractor.  Easy to use and work great, I've not yet needed to replace a battery after a storage season.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceSure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.
I replace these about every two years or about 60 days of camping.  If you use your RV more thanyou may want to replace it more often.  This one is for a 6 gal tank and we have a 10 gal tank.  We did buy one last year for the 10 but it would not fit.I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months.Installed this in my 95 Civic Hatchback.  It is brighter than any bulbs I have ever put in the civic and I have own the car many years.  All the Civic forums suggested that this is the brightest bulb you can get for you EG civic (other than HID).  Supposedly, it only has a 200 hour life.  Even if I average an hour per day, that is still at least 6 months.  I'm okay with that.
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror.
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.
Hooked this up to the battery under my motorcycle seat making it really easy to connect to a trickle chargerI like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom?I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.Will it work? YesMaybe a squeeze bottle would be better as bottle is not always being stored upright.Area needs to be free of grease.
This tool requires the use of anti-sieze compound when chasing the threads.  Doing this gets the rust and crud out of the threads.  This is a must for proper seating and sealing of the O2 sensor.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.
The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.Item arrived when promised, and was well packaged. I like the way this wax goes on, and it does leave a beautiful brilliant shine on my car.  It does require a little extra effort to get that sweet look.Here's a little hint: EVERY SCION xA & xB can use a cabin filter, and it is a great upgrade to make. It doesn't matter if it came with the option from the factory: every HVAC unit comes with the filter tray. All you have to do is install it.There is only one thing I require for a cabin air filter, and that's the absence of cow dung particulate when traveling along the Central California section of I-5 when it's 110 degrees and hasn't rained in four months.From personal experience, this filter delivers the goods at a great price. It fits the carrier tray perfectly, just make sure you lock the filter's lip into all the tray's plastic snaps. It'll click, so it doesn't require much brain power.
Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard.Don't go RV'ing without one of these.  Many campgrounds use well water and it often tastes bad.  This filter elliminates that and gives you tasty, drinkable water at every facet.  Connect this directly to your water pressure regulator, and then to the hose, so your rv hose does not accumulate the nasty water tastes as well.  Don't forget to use it when you fill your fresh water tank as well...This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
Users might have trouble understanding exactly how to use the gauge without the instructions in hand because the design isn't intuitive.  But I do 'really like' this item.Simply taking a pressure reading is easy enough: Power on, hold it in your hand with your thumb on the raised bumps on that little slope above the big round button and press it against the valve until it beeps a couple of seconds later.  The reading is very accurate and the display easy to read in any weather condition.  And once you set your target pressures in the unit you can see how well your reading matches your preferred pressure.  On these points alone, I give it four stars, but not five for the following reasons.- The gauge powers off only a moment after you take a reading, so you have to start it again and select front or rear for each tire.  There should be a way to set how many seconds before it shuts off.- I don't even remember what the biggest button on the gauge does, but both its placement and the way it's marked causes you to naturally think it's the power and reset button.  It's not.  If I have to guess, it's probably "Enter" for when you're setting it up with your target tire pressures--I don't remember.- Bottom button, don't remember.  The bottom line on design here is, too many buttons which aren't intuitive or logically placed.Keeps my battery charged and easy to hook up. Just connect either the alligator clips or the ring terminals and plug the unit into the wall and you're done! This unit is very simple a single LED tells you the status of the charge/battery. For the price can't go wrong and it's nice to know that when you go to start up whatever it is, you can count on it.This little thing works perfectly!  I use to use a pressure bleeder, but was concerned about what some people say, that pressure bleeders push more air into the brake fluid, which causes both more air and moisture to absorb into the fluid.  Best way is to press the brake pedal, or put a vacuum on the bleeder screws.  A vacuum would be nice, but also a lot more work to setup initially.Instructions say this check valve does not work on air, only brake fluid, but on empty systems you can still pump the pedal until fluid comes out, and run your drain side pipe into a container that has brake fluid at the bottom.  That way you only suck back up fluid, not air.  Once you have fluid in the lines, this is completely unnecessary.  Did all 8 bleed screws on a Brembo-equipped car, was effortless.  I completely trust this little check valve, hope it lasts.  Rinsed it out with simple green and then a little PB Blaster to keep it from corroding or whatever.Remember to buy a couple more yards of cheap 3/16" clear hose from the hardware store, so you'll never run out, and can throw away what you've used after each brake job.The included hose clamp is worthless, but you don't need it anyways.Another great trick to compress pistons is to crack open the bleeder screw first, then push in each brake piston.  Fluid will go out through this check valve, instead of fighting every other brake piston.  Makes life a LOT easier, and does not push old fluid back up the brake lines or risk overflowing your reservoir.
If you have a camper water heater like mine its almost impossible to get a wrench on the drain plug.  This solves the problem.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.Headline says it all.  I use it to pump up a water well pressure tank from a 12 v battery using a small portable air compressor.
This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System TesterI have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast (received next day) and just got done hooking it up. I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals). I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged. It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling. Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs. The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase.
Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.Great feeler gauge!Equip it in Corrosion-X, or WD40 for long lasting.Great to measure spark plug gaps, for performing valve adjustments (valve gap), etc...It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!
Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.This fits perfectly onto my Scion 2006 XB. Cheap. Just did an oil and filter change. I would buy this again and reccomend this item.Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!
The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was "lost" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O. No explaination was given when I contacted the company. Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance. My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra. The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota's optional "tow package". Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long. The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way. Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal. If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake. If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good..Overall this is a pretty nice little unit.  It is compact, shipped in a compact box and the overall product quality is good. Product comes with an easily removable vacuum pump, solid plastic collection ball, collection tube of larger diameter tubing that connects to a smaller diameter tube that looks to be wire reinforced plastic covered tubing that easily should fit in most dipstick tubes. Tubes were long enough so I could sit the unit on the floor and have plenty of tube to insert down the dipstick tube.  Very easy to set up and use and the included red funnel makes it very easy and neat to pour the waste into a container for recycle.  The pump, funnel and the tube simply push onto the ball which has rubber type attachments.  I put a little oil on the o-ring under the top rubber piece to help improve the seal.  I bought this to change engine oil for a car that uses 7 liters of 5w-30 synthetic oil.  I ran the engine to heat up the oil some before I started the removal.  The system worked and got just about all of the oil out of the engine through the dipstick.  BUT, it took 4 hours to extract the oil.  The oil moves very slowly through the 1/8&#34; diameter or so tube that is inserted into the dipstick.  With the viscosity of the oil, the small diameter of the tubing and the limited amount of vacuum you can create - you can expect anywhere from 1/2 hour to 1 hour per quart. I tried this with some lighter viscosity fluids and it works really good.  This will be good for the snowblower, generator and other small oil volume units I have.  If you have time this is a nice item.  If you want it done quick this will not be your best option.First of all, the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second, once the car is started, you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display, indicating that a charge is occurring. However, this is a static icon, it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom. And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery. For this you need accurate readings, and I can not see these on this unit.
This stuff is easy to use, and really works well. Anybody that is a car nut, will use this stuff, and for good reason, it's a great product.Easy to apply and lasts a long time. Works well on tires, black rubber bumpers & trim.My problem (and it's just me) is the product is a bit too shiny for my liking.  It's a personal preference. If shiny is what you're looking for then this is it.Meguires makes great product and I've got a garage full of their stuff.Excellent kit for a normal width receiver. It has all you need. It will not fit a Tacoma or Tundra as the pins are not long enough. For a regular width receiver it is a perfect set, I just wish they would make a kit like this for the larger receiver. The kit is complete and very nice but I can't dock it stars for not fitting an unusual receiver. One key for all is great and it comes in a nice storage bag.
Just what it is - brass drain plug.  Normal quality as you would buy in a hardware store if you could find this configuration for this specific purpose.To me? Grabage... the quality of this set has gone downhill IMO... I have an older set that rocks so I bought this newer set for another trailer - garbage.  Mismatched looking pins and locks. Hitch cover lock is plactic and doesnt hold well. I would recommend buying local so that you can try it and return it... Thank you AMAZON for allowing me to return this POG.great price, quick delivery - looked every where for this item to provide the option of connecting my 2 standard length hoses, in the event that I needed to, instead of having to purchase yet another, longer, waste hose - highly recommended
I was tired of tire gauges that weren't accurate or didn't make a good seal, so I read pretty much all the reviews of all the gauges and ended up with the Moroso. It has a good feel, and unlike some reviews, I don't find it flimsy. I did get the rubber cover. It is a pleasure to use: the seal to the valve is tight and immediate, and the pressure is displayed legibly and accurately. I had a lithium digital gauge and this is a huge improvement. Sometimes "old school" is the best!The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.I'm not shocked that there were no wires, even though the picture shows wires.  But I am surprised that the dust cover - which appears to be integral in the picture - is not included.  All that's in the package is the clamp itself and some self-drilling sheetmetal screws.  Maybe I'll check back some day and see that the picture has been changed or the description has been updated to reflect reality, in which case I'll change the number of stars.  But for now, I'm knocking two stars off for the deceptive ad, and another star for the product really being a fairly cheap piece.  In my opinion, the piece isn't a great value; the price is at best only "fair".  And yeah, I know, we're not reviewing prices.  But it's a cheaply-made product which lacks finish; I think the bottom side could've been solid instead of having the exposed ribbing, and I think the included screws (which appear to at least be stainless) should've come with appropriately-sized washers to distribute the load on the plastic.
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.Maybe you are old enough to remember the old forks you pounded into your suspension to remove ball joints.  This little gizmo saves the seal, and pops the joint out in just a few turns.  Leave the nut on so it doesn't go flying.  There is a bearing on the end of the screw on my version, so the end of the screw is not 'swirling' metal on metal.
handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer.Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.Removing spark plugs from the Ford Modular V8's can be exceedingly frustrating; especially if you snap a plug in half while trying to remove it. The diameter of this tool steadies your approach down into the depths of the head and prevents you from leaning your tool sideways; thereby making in easier to remove the plug in one piece.
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my carsFits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates.  I'm happy.  It doesn't fit all cars.  Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight!!
I've had Husky liners in several vehicles and swear by their fit and longevity. Only drawback is the tread depth is not particularly great. While the sides are adequate for keeping any slush you drag in confined to the liner, sometimes (but certainly not all the time) your shoes will be sitting in the mud/slush/water. No big deal to pull em out and dump em, but could be perfect with even just another 1/4 inch of tread depth.Other than that, the plastic is of perfect ridgity to mold to the contours of your Jeep and the colors are steadfast for a very long time. Have both the front and rear liners in my JKUS.these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the levelThese are so nice to have, no more using pieces of wood for under the stabilizer jacks. The wood usually ended up in the bonfire, and then I would have nothing. You must have something under the jacks, or the trailer will sink into the ground. For the money their great! I like the strap that keeps them together.
Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.  I typically prefer to go up a size on wipers since it gives a larger clean area.  You can typically go up 2 inches which translates to one inch per side from where the blade attached to the arm.  When the car is dirty, you should be able to see where that extra inch goes - if it hits the top of the trim or other part, you're out of luckWe're using a 28" blade on the drivers side of my wife's Mazda5, and this clears very nicely - no skips or squeaking.  Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.
I liked the concept of this, and bought two at the same time. We have small ranch, and varying watering/hosing needs. We typically buy the 7 way adjustable nozzles, but I thought these would allow more versatility.These nozzles perform well, but not as good as a conventional nozzle. For a start, there is no quick way to get the desired spray pattern, you have to slowly rotate the head and stop when you think it is what you need, often messing around 'finely tuning' it to try and get the best result. Secondly, none of the 'jet' part of the adjustments creates a clean jet, there is always a fine mist or errant second or third jet spraying in a different direction at the same time.These cannot create all the spray patterns found on a 7 way nozzle, and create poor patterns on the ones they can create.This is a good idea, but in reality you are better off with a 7 way nozzle.I had a set of an earlier version of these chains that I used dozens of times in deep snow over many years until the car rusted away.  The hardest part of installation was installing the elastic tensioning device.  The big burly guy in their video makes it look easy but it wasn't so easy for me.  I found that using a skate tightening tool, a metal hook on a plastic handle, made the operation routine instead of a struggle.  Amazon sells an A&R; Lace Tightener which looks like the one I used.To install these cables, after dragging one end from under the car, pull the top inside connecter up and forward to the outside of the tire as much as possible and connect it.  Next connect the top outside connector.  Now push the top inside connector back to the inside of the tire.  Clear the area of anybody with tender ears in case you are prone to verbally expressing your feelings while engaging in frustrating operations.  Now connect the bottom connector.  On solid ground this is sometimes easy.  In snow you may have to keep pulling it back and forth in the back of the tire so it can dig down into the snow and ice until you get enough slack to connect it.  Once this is done it is time to attach the tensioner.  Attach the section where you will have the most leverage last because you will need a lot of leverage to make the last connection.  This is probably the connections at the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions.  Use the lace tightener to help and don't be surprised if you have to remove your gloves for the last connections.  Get both chains on the tires before you do the tensioners so that you can get your frozen fingers back in a warm location as quickly as possible.Removal is the opposite of installation except it isn't hard to disconnect things.For easier connections buy the Peerless Auto Trac chains.  For easier tensioner installation buy the Auto Trac Chains or the expensive Thule chains.  For easier removal buy the Thule chains with the pull release or the Auto Trac chains.Chains are better than cables for traction but the cables have greater tire clearance and possibly better durability and plenty good traction until the snow is deep enough that the bottom of the car is pushing it out of the way and dragging on it.For my next car I first bought Thule chains (soon to be returned) and then Peerless Auto Trac (soon to be delivered) for the greater ease of installation and better traction in deep snow.  I will submit reviews for those after enough time has passed to give a valid review.I give these cable chains five stars for function and durability but an overall rating of four stars due to the difficulty of installation.As other reviewers have noted, do the first installation and the first installation each year in a dry level location to familiarize yourself with the procedure.  Do an installation when they first arrive to make sure they fit your car and to make sure all components are there.  Don't wait because the Amazon automatic easy return policy is only good for 30 days.  You should probably wait until bad weather to order them so that you can try them out while there is still time to return them.I have used this on 3 camping excursions now, and it was full past the brim on all occasions, so i cannot say if it is waterproof or not for sure, but the material definitly seems as if it will keep water out when the lid is folded down around the zipper. The included straps do not SEEM that durable, but they certainly worked fine for 3 trips. i did but some additional straps, but only to minimize the profile of the bag to get it out of the garage. The only lacking feature is you have to get up and over the side, and the side only opens up on 2 edges, otherwise this was a cheap alternative to what was probably the same product other places.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville
This does what it says it does. It is really heavy and is a bit much to lug around, but overall good.This is a great tread-depth gauge. It seems accurate and does what it is meant to do. It's built from metal, not plastic so it feels like it's a good quality tool.The thing does not curve. The cable is straight but seems well made and perfect size, love the handle, easy and safe.
If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.Can never go wrong with slime stuff.Don't put too much in a tire or you will be able to feel it moving around when you ride...a dirt bike...for instance.You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletWell , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.
After owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!!My 1999 Lexus RX300 was getting CEL (P0125, P1030, P1033 & P1035).  Read the postings on ClubLexus and found Denso 234-9009 is perfect fit for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (behind firewall, access from underneath the vehicle).  Removing the connector is the biggest job.  Used a pickup tool with wire prongs to hold the sensor connector part from the top, pressed the tab on the right connector and disconnected relatively easily.  Jacked up the front passenger side, went underneath the vehicle and sprayed PB blaster penetrating oil on the old sensor threads, waited for a few minutes and was able to get it out easily using an O2 sensor removal tool.  Applied the anti-seize that came with the package on the new sensor threads and installed.  Total time spent was under 30 minutes!  Disconnected the battery negative terminal for a few minutes, then started the engine and the codes didn't come back!  Check out the pictures posted in the images section.This sensor works for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (before catalytic converter, access from underneath the vehicle) and Bank 2 Sensor 1 (between the engine and radiator, accessed from the top).Note: Recommend using two jack stands for added safety while working under the vehicle.PB Blaster:Blaster 16-PB Penetrating Catalyst - 11 oz.O2 Sensor Tool:Powerbuilt 648691 Oxygen Sensor Offset PullerUpdate: February 16, 2014The Check Engine Light (CEL) is staying off and the mileage has improved.  My vehicle registration is coming up and it is due for SMOG check.  I'll update the review with the results of the test.The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds.
I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:"18 gauge wire""15 Amp Capacity"Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield.Before going to my review, I'd just like to say that this oil is available in 5 quart containers for substantially less money at Walmart. Walmart is the only retailer that sells the 5 quart containers. As for the oil, in my opinion there's nothing better. I used it in my 2002 Hyundai Santa Fe which I recently sold. Contrary to the recommendations in the owners manual, I changed my oil at 15,000 mile intervals. When I sold the car, it had 124,000 miles on it and the engine was as good as new. Throughout the many years that I've used Mobil 1 synthetic oil, I've never had to add a drop of oil to my car, despite the excessive mileage that I accumulate between oil changes. Now, I have a 2009 Toyota Camry and I'm doing the same thing. There are those who say that you have to change your oil every 3,000 miles. This is ridiculous. There are also those who say that changing your oil every 15,000 miles is insane. Well, regardless of what the experts say, I can tell you from experience that if you use this oil, you do not have to change it for 15,000 miles, period. There will be no damage to your engine and you'll end up saving a ton of money on unnecessary oil changes. The bottom line is that this is a great product and it works exactly as advertised. It deserves 5 stars.I admittedly didn't see the sound byte of the horn until now, and if I had heard it earlier, I would have thought differently. I installed this to have a lower, and hopefully louder tone in my horn. The factory horn was lower though. I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now, so on an Isuzu Trooper, it is a little pathetic. I blame this on myself though, and I realize the product is good for its intended audience. Just don't buy this if you havea  truck! The look of this horn, if you have it visible, is a plus, and the shipping and installation were a breeze.
Got one of these mounted in my vehicle. Seems to have a quality build and a ok mount. Makes install a little easier, just remember that you'll have to get to this ASAP is something does happen so mount it somewhere you'll be able to get to even if you're upside down. ( Hopefully never ) This is just another one of those "just incase" tools that you carry and hope you never need. But better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it.Awesome microbfiber towel! I just wish it did not have the tag attached to it - it leaves a mark if you let it contact the surface of your car.Take tube A, squeeze a bit out, take Tube B, squeeze a bit out.  Mix them up, apply it to whatever surface you wish, hold it in place (if applicable) for a bit.  Wait 24hrs (just to be safe), and not have to think about it again.I used it to secure 9" LED strips (Rubber) to my rear fairings (Plastic, and road grimy at that) and it's holding up like a champ.
This item is made by Clore Automotive, stating it is a US manufacturer.This item is their "top of the line" with heavy duty cables and heavy duty battery.The cables do not stick very well in the clip-on mount (built into the carrying handle), twisting them a bit helped.The unit comes with a one-time lifetime repair voucher of $50. Impressive, considering the purchase price.Checking out the details before and after purchase revealed severe issues when checking for proper operating and maintaining the unit.The manual(s) for the unit, either the one that came with the item or the one online, call for a immediate charge upon receipt of either 12 hours or 24 hours. The times for charging after use or regular storage differ dramatically as well.Contacted the manufacturer. Answer was that "it does not matter if 12 or 24 hours". So why wasting a 12 hour charge if it does not matter and the unit still has full capacity? Does it have full capacity? Answer "Should not be critical". What???Contacted the manufacturer again regarding maintaining the charge after use or when in storage. Was told that "it does not really matter", just charge it every 90 days.This is in complete contradiction to the 2 different manuals for this unit. Lack of quality, an American issue, still present.So what is there to do now? Sure it will start a vehicle once, then how is it supposed to be charged? How is it supposed to be charged when not in use? How long will it last?Well, it is a small and supposedly powerful unit, so lets wait and see.Update:Ran the 1000 amp battery on a conversion van completely down (listening to weather radio when the tornado hit a few weeks ago at a Michigan campground). Turned everything off in the car and attached the unit to the battery, then waited about 3 minutes (should be common sense, to allow electricity to float and settle). The little unit turned the engine over with no effort at all. It certainly provided a satisfactory effect first (by not being stranded) and a "wow" effect right after. Quite a accomplishment for a small unit like that.The unit was recharged for some hours calculated from the different statements the manufacturer made, somehow in the middle. The unit got us going, and for this price it might be worth keeping it.I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.This is the Cadillac of battery chargers.  I put my Miata on the charger each winter.  Doesn't overcharge the battery, doesn't dry out the cells, just works perfectly.  It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.  At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.  A new battery is about $100.  Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.  Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one.
REPLACE THEM AT 90,000 MILES AND ENGINE FEELS SMOOTHER AND MORE RESPONSIVE... I CHECKED ON ACDELCO CATALOG AND GAVE ME THIS PART NUMBER FOR MY TRUCK..REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS WITH IRIDIUM AC DELCO AS WELL..LEXOL IS THE BEST SRAY FOR CLEANING LEATHER SEATS IN YOU AUTOMOBILE AND KEEPING THEM FROM CRACKING IN THE SUMMER AND WINTER MONTHS ,WHILE KEEPINGB THEM MOIST AND PLIABLE AND SOFT,SO I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT LEXOL ,TO KEEP THEIR VEHICLE CLEAN.THANKS AGAIN AMAZON.COM.ALL THE BEST FOR 2013NICE PRODUCT DOES WHAT IS MEANT TO DO. THE TAPE SEEMS TO HOLD PRETTY GOOD ONLY TIME WILL TELL SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ALONG TIME AGO.
Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.I recently purchased this item to use for off road recovery while using the Hi-Lift jack. It's well made, heavy duty and should work just fine!this is a great compliment to anawesome jack!  I highly recommend having this if you own the jack.  It can be of great use when using the jack is tough due to angles, etc.
Just received the tail bag and it looks to be of good quality workmanship. I was surprised to find out it had a rain cover that also doubled as a safety reflector. You can never have too many visibility features on a motorcycle! It comes in a nice box and the instructions on how to install are clear. I have some soft-sided sport bags on my bike already but I'm considering getting the matching set for this tail bag to make it all look cohesive and to take advantage of its built-in compatibility with this unit. Nice Cordura material which should keep my stuff safe and dry for the most part. It's big enough for a shaving kit, some underwear, spare gloves, etc.I have a possible solution for the tight-coupler problem. I used to have a Caterpillar grease gun that had to be pried off the fitting just like this gun does. It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun.  This works for me.  Good luck.I've yet to use the garden hose connector for dumping grey water, but this is a good cap. It's a bit of a hassle and breakage worry when twisting it on with the additional protrusions of the hose and leash, so I'm subtracting a star. I do have a spare cap in case something on this one breaks.
I have owned these for about 8 years now.  They have held up very well.  No bend or flex ever noticed.  I use them for any under-car work that doesn't require the wheels being removed.  They are light, and easy to store by hanging them off a screw using the hole they already have built in.To the reviews that say they slide a lot: you need to have a gentle foot on the gas pedal.  If you try to drive up the ramps fast, you may push the ramp.  Take your time, be smooth with the gas, and you'll get up ok.Note if you own a low-riding sports car, the angle of these might not be low enough for you.  The easy solution to that problem is to take something like a 1"x10" board and butt it against the ramp.  Drive up on the wood first then continue onto the ramp.For the price, these are an A+ purchase!I have 3 of these and highly recommend them as a "deterrant".  Yes, if someone is determined it can be broken off or they can stab the tank, but quick gas theft can be avoided if they can find a car with a non-locking gas cap (put a small sticker on your gas panel that states locking gas cap and the door may not be pried open, it may be passed up).  Avoid pranks, vandalism, and gas theft with these.  They are a little hard to figure out initially but simple after that.  I have never had a dash light come on from these for leaking, on '09 Tacoma, '08, '11 IS250, and '12 Tundra, or '04 RX-330 (different type/model number). Excellent value.Update Oct. 2012:Excellent device and value. Always works great and easily. Worth it with high fuel prices.Update June 2013:These work great and I bought two more; one for a Chevy Aveo, and one to replace a lost locking cap, as there is no tether, nor are they made for one. My wife and I have never had a bad experience with these. Easy to use, just practice with them before you get to the pump. It locks and clicks with the key out. When you want to open it just insert the key, turn it CCW, then CW to remove the key. It locks easily and is removed easily. I disaggree with the negative reviews, but I also disaggree with the sizing advice from Amazon, do some research. If yours screws do not get one without screws, if the OEM has no screws do not get one with screws. The photos seem to be accurate. Example: I contacted Stant and they recommended a non screw 10506 for my Tacoma and Tundra yet they take a screw type 10504, not the 10506, so do your research.There are many types of clay out there but this works great on a newer vehicle or one that only needs to be dressed up a bit. Easy to work with and requires little effort. I use a spray lube and have found Mequiars Final Inspection does the job.Make sure the surface is washed before starting.Unless you drop some or have other issues, one bar will be enough for most vehicles. I've been able to do 3 small cars with one of these bars.You could shop all over and play hit or miss for a couple bucks or just do it right the first time.
I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System TesterIts what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.
This is put together well. Not sure why I would need it but just in case I want to run an inverter off of a 12 vdc battery then I canReally cool thing, it is digital so it doesn't matter where you put it, my electric recommended to put it in the middle under console so if someone will try to lift your car it will sense it instantly, because if you put it on one side and the car will be lifted from the other side it might not sense it. But then another electric came and said that it is digital sensor so it doesn't matter where to put it, finally they put it where it was easier for them :) even though I was asking them to put it in a middle as first one recommended in the beginning.And don't worry about parking your car on the hill - it will remember it is position once it is armed and won't trigger alarm, may be old gyroscope based ones were making triggering the alarm.We tested it then, lifted car from the other side and you had to lift your car about 3&#34; before alarm got triggered by this tilt sensor. I was joking that tires are already stolen because for me 3&#34; were to high and expectations were that it will trigger instantly once car lifted more than 1&#34;. But hey, not always you can force your electrics to do what you want them to do.I had high hopes for this, but it turns out that it is more of a pain than it is worth. Constantly have to turn it as it spins in the door. If I could do it again I would not buy this product.
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.I used it on a recent spark plug install and I guess it will work OK.  Well, it was a little messy going on and I didn't have any trouble with the install.  But, I really won't know how well it works until I remove the plugs - hopefully, years from now.  :-D  So, maybe Amazon will still be around by then and I can give an update when that happens.  Either it works or it don't - we'll see.  :-)This wax goes on easy but you will get a work out taking it off but that will pay off, this wax will last for a while. I have applied it several months ago and the water still beeds up like I waxed it last week.  I used a electric buffer to take it off that will make it easier on you.
I have been using this product for years and it has never failed me. I now have one in each car for emergency purposes. It is noisybut strong and durable.I already have one that is several years old and has been perfect. I bought this new one as a gift for someone else. I highly recommend this for all types of 12V batteries, including the new AGM models. I use it on car, motorcycle and lawn mower batteries. Just hook it up and forget about it. This is the &#34;smart&#34; one that electronically monitors the battery so that it does not over-charge. It costs a few dollars more but it has paid for itself many times over, by extending the life of several batteries.haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.If you are a professional or just a want a be then this is a great product for you!!!!  Your car will look like glass when done!!!This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.
keeps your jeep cleaneasy to installeasy to take out and cleaneasy to uselooks good too:)Simple device, works fine, not hard to read.  Nice to have this gauge to check tires from time to time and be able to verify what the tire guys are telling you.They did what they are supposed to kept my trailer from rolling away i am going to the Lynx chocks due to upgrading to the Lynx levelers.
You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road.Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.Have you heard the Mazda 3 horn?  It wounds like the wussiest horn you've ever heard.  Add this horn in addition to your stock horn and you will no longer be the laughing stock of other motorists when you honk at them!  If you by any chance drive a 2010 and up Mazda 3, search google for "mazda 3 horn upgrade" and you will find a link to novustechnic that has a terrific step by step installation guide.I *highly* recommend this upgrade (it's a great safety upgrade as well).
Excellent battery tender......keeps a constant charge on my battery.........shuts off when it has powered up the battery......really nothing to do but, but, turn it off when full.I Love it  . Takes a while to break in until then you may get some wax streaks and not pick up all the dust but within a month it is perfect and like they say only improves the dirtier it becomes just shake off outside before putting back in the case and stuffing it in the trunk or map pocket .Came with separate acid.  Was easy to fill with no mess, although it takes several minutes.  Wait 30 min after, then charge it for a few hours, then let sit for a few hours and test voltage... if correct, install in the bike.  Not much else to say, it works.
Really great stuff, it can pick up dirt and easily be cleaned in the bucket, really great if you are using a two bucket wash.I've used this a few times already and it is great. It is super soft and will not leave any scratches on the car. You can also rinse out almost all the water in it by squeezing it so drying it after is pretty fast too (though I recommend machine washing it after you use it to keep it clean, you don't want to use a dirty mitt to wash your car).The filter fits perfectly.  The instructions for replacing the used filter are incomplete as they do not address the touring model which has a slow release lever to open the lower glove box gently. It must be detached first. Then the stops on both side must actually be removed (they are designed that way) to lower the glove box and access the filter holder.  Because plastic parts must be detached and removed this process should not be done in cold weather conditions
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.Matched my car's color perfectly!  I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review...I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.
I have been sold on Lucas Oil Products for many years.  I have gone through gallons of this stuff and I beleive it has add years of life to our two vehicles.  Both Ford vehicles are at 145K+ miles and running strong.I had bought a couple of these many years ago but recently bought a travel trailer so needed 4 more (could only find one of my old ones).  They are now dated for replacement.  After buying these I found them at Walmart for $1.25 less per unit. The Walmart ones were dated a year later than the Amazon ones.Ordered these as a replacement on my Nissan Maxima and they worked perfect thus far. I had a set of Rain X blades that didn't even last a year so I am hoping for a better life span on these... I will update review in the future of they do not meet my expectations but after a few weeks and several different occasions of using them I have no complaints...
As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.Decided not to attach it to the counter behind the stove. New camper phobia. Makes a nice work space. Put it on the bed when we travel so it does not rattle.
Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.It does what it is supposed to and suds up.How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL
Five stars for novelty.Five stars for convenience.One star for being a necessity.I really like this product. It is very neat to pop what appears to be a large white tablet out of a bubble pack and add water, then watch it grow into a thick  wet paper towel. You can use it to clean up spills by putting the tablet on the spill and using it to absorb the liquid as it turns into a paper towel. This product has the consistency more of a very thick paper towel than a cloth. It is paper and reminds me of the old paper towels called Job Squad of the late eighties and early nineties that were monster thick and could handle any paper towel job or spill. The first time I used one I thought "Wow this product is neat, it is like something from Star Trek or the Jetsons". It is literally a tablet that turns into a small "cloth", you simply add liquid and unfold it. If you have a real need for keeping a small conveniently dry paper towel stored some where to use later this is an excellent product. The problem is, I can not think of any real situations where you can not just keep a roll of paper towels or a cloth. This product might be useful for hunters, fisherman, or boaters because they can be put in a pocket to use later as needed. They would also be great to use by outdoors men if it is raining and impractical to have paper towels. It may just be I have a lack of imagination for its uses since I am a home body. The product is great if you really need it. But in most situations a roll of paper towels will do the trick.I put this on an 8' trailer to keep the tongue out of the dirt.  A bit of overkill for such a small trailer but would be perfect for a typical boat or snowmobile trailer.Why is this better than a piece of lumber? Nobody mistakes it for firewood and tosses it into a camp fire... leaving you with nothing just when you happen to need it.Haven't tried it in mud but have used it on soft sand and softer dirt. Worked great. The load is spread out over an area of almost one square foot. A bit expensive for a piece of plastic but worth it.

I have used this for years on my motorcycle battery. The adapters are included , so I leave it hooked up to my battery and run the wire under the seat. When I'm ready to hook it up , all i have to do is plug it in .This one i bought for my mother to use when her car sits idle for a few months every year while she travels.I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months.I bought this battery for a lantern at my mountain cabin I need to keep charged when the power goes out.  I charged it to a full charge and tested the lantern and it will stay lite for over (8) hours which is longer than the original battery.  You just have to remember only to charge the battery until the green light comes and then unplug it.
I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.This rain suit is awesome for the money iam a motorcycle safety instructor and this is the kinda of product i recommend new students purchase its made great and can be seen in the rainI wasn't sure about this pad until I got it. I thought it would be soft flimsy, boy was I wrong. This little pad is built to last. Its very sturdy and holds up under the weight of my Highlander.
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
Best choice for the price point research shows penzoil outperforms Mobil 1 in wear test, number one is amsoil but royal purple is a close second and for the money it is number one. Mobil 1 just has excellent marketing it truly is JUNK, but keep buying it if you buy into the marketing lie ; ) .this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going.What a ripoff, you can buy this at a parts store for  $5. With advance auto coupon code for 3"% off it's $4
I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks.Have you ever felt like your auto mechanic was "Mr. Wizard"?  All the way down to the bad attitude?  Only to find he has a doo-dad sitting somewhere out of eyesight that tells all, like a crystal ball...Well for a reasonable price you can get your own crystal ball.  It might be able to predict the future and track flying monkeys but it can tell you very quickly why the "Check Engine" light has come on.  Big or small you know what might be waiting for you when you go see Mr. Wizard.  Sometimes you might even be able to track down the problem yourself and cut the cost to fix it.I would not go to Oz without mine!Been looking for something to shine up this ole diamond plate toolbox I bought from craigslist.Tried regular car wax,nothing,Brasso,nothing.Decide to try this & see what happened.Made the box look brand new.Couldnt be happier.Might have to get more to have on hand.Took some pics to show how this stuff worked,but I only see a way to add a video.Thought you used to be to put pics here.Oh well.
I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.I still use the square aluminum jack stands and I guess it really all depends on the brand you have or something cause these pads needed to be about 1/8&#34; bigger to fit mine so I was not pleased with that though I didn't have anything to block up my tongue when parked so these worked for that I guess. They need to make these things a TINY bit bigger then they can put a picture of a basic jack stand on the front .... till they do it;s really false advertising cause they do not fit either sets of my regular square aluminum jack stands.They are as described. I removed the double sided tape because I wanted to use a flexible silicone along with the screws to permanently mount these to my travel trailer. Now I no longer need to get out my 4ft level when I arrive at the camp site.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr.

Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.

I couldn't be happier with the look, style, quality and most importantly the strength of the handles.  I'm one step closer to off roading thanks to Rugged Ridge!!!

This is the review I did when these filters were sold in "packs of 2" There are some mistakes which i will highlight in brackets.These filters (PL20195) were bought as a replacement for the Toyota filters that are found on the 2.5L D-4D diesel engine in the Toyota Hilux pickup truck. They are of a very high quality as judged by the sealing gasket, the anti-drain back valve and its weight.Filter is being used with Mobil 1 Delvac 15W-40 (edit: it was actually 5W-40) Fully Synthetic engine oil and the engine noise has certainly reduced from its previous dino based lubricant.In my country, the Toyota dealership(TTTL) charges about US$28 for one filter; purchasing online and having the filters shipped cost me about US$13 for one.I highly recommend this filter as a high quality replacement that doesn't break the bank or if you plan to extend oil drain intervals.Now the technical stuff for people that want to know:PL20195 = PL20064 minus the pressure relief bypass valve (exactly the same dimensions)PL20195 is a longer version of the PL10241PL20064 is a longer version of the PL10028 (edit: the PL10028 doesn't have an antidrainback valve)The larger the filter usually means:1)that it takes longer for the oil pump to fill it.2)that there is more filter medium to trap more contaminants out of your oil3)that the oil will pass through the filter medium slower4)theoretically that a higher RPM will be required to activate the filter bypass valve (which means that you can rev your engine slightly higher without the oil bypassing the filter medium) - this really depends on the PSI that the pressure relief valve was designed with, but if a small filter and a larger filter have the same PSI value for the "relief" then this theory should hold true.Today the filter is currently being used with Shell Rimula R4 15W-40 for 8000Km oil change intervalsI used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless.I just installed this filter (Fram CH9972) in a 2009 Toyota Highlander 4-cyl.  The filter and the o-rings fit fine.  This filter element looked very similar to the used element I pulled out of the filter housing.  I purchased the filter element from Walmart for ~$6-$7, all local auto parts stores had this filter for $11-$14.  I also purchased from Amazon theK-D Tools 3253 End Cap Oil Filter Wrenchto remove the filter housing.I followed the instructions from a YouTube video "2008 Highlander Oil Change".  The video is for 6-cyl engine, but the process for 4-cyl is very similar, except that you do not have to remove anything to access the filter housing.  The filter housing is just behind the bumper cover.The process is a bit more complicated and messier than replacing a spin-on oil filter, but nothing too difficult to prevent me from doing it again.I gave this filter 4-star rating because there are higher efficiency filters for this application, e.g. Purolator PureOne PL25608, which also seems to have better construction.  Unfortunately, I could not find one for sale locally and it would cost $20+ from AdvancedAutoParts with S&H;, so buying Fram CH9972 made the most sense for me.UPDATE AUG-2010:  Check your local Toyota dealership for this filter cartridge.  My local dealership's price was the lowest anywhere at $5.
there are a number of misunderstandings about this product:what it is:  it is a washer fluid concentrate where you add 4 oz per gallon of water.... you don't need anything else unless you are using it below freezing...  so in warm climates its an all in one productantifreeze:  if you need to use it in sub freezing weather, just add 1/2 bottle of rubbing alcohol and it works fine down to about -20Fyou can add it to washing fluids if you want, but seems like sort of a waste of moneyIMPORTANT:  the rain x effect is cumulative with this product, it builds up over time and stays at its best when you always use it, not just every other bottle or whatever....  I live in FL, use this in plain water every time and nothing else, and my windshield  sheds water like crazy, I almost never need to use the wipers....  if you USE IT CONSISTENTLY IT WORKS PERFECTi use this cleaner on my 04 wrx,i run it through the intake,the gas and the oil,as far as running it through the oil you should only do it right before  an oil change as seafoam isnt a lubricant, if you put it in your oil do it before an oil change run your car for about 40 miles then change the oil and you will be goodrunning through your gas is self explanatory just dump it in:)for running through the intake i find the easiest way is to put in through the brake booster,when you do poor it in slowly  otherwise your car will die,the engine may stumble while pouring it in but that's fine,after you've done that shut the car off for about 10 minutes,after that start your car up and go for a drive and enjoy the smoke show,your car will run ten times better afterwords and it will idle smoother as well great product!This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used. It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available. Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this. Check on forums for you car if you're unsure.
Don't know why others have problems with the RP diff oil but I have had it in my M3's diff for the past 30,000 miles and I have no complaints whatsoever. The oil that was in before made the diff whine at certain speeds and it was pretty noticeable. It did go away after I put the RP in and I haven't had any problems since. I love RP and use throughout my car from engine oil to diff oil I recommend it.Some months ago there was a review here where a Tacoma 2.7L owner talked about Purolator filters being too restrictive causing excessive valve noise and possibly contributing to the early demise of his engine. I don't know where that review went but having used Wix or Purolator filters exclusively on my 2008 Tacoma I have noticed occasions where it was exceptionally valvey sounding though I did not equate it with a particular oil filter being on it. On my last oil change I replaced the Purolator that was on there with a Toyota filter, and used the same weight Mobil 1 oil that I always use, and the valve noise went away! I realize now that our old Corolla went through periods where I thought the valve noise was excessive too and it was probably when I had a Purolator on it. I hate to say this about Purolators, because I have always considered them to be fantastic filters, but maybe they don't play well with Toyotas. I am going to stick with Toyota filters from now on.Edit: I finally found the other review I had seen and it was posted to the Purolator PL14476 (which is the Corolla filter) instead of this one as I had thought. Now there are 2 reviews there talking about the same issue.I had a misfire after I had replaced the plugs with what the auto store had recommended.After reading reviews about these, I tried them out and it fixed the misfire.Good price for high quality plugs. ($20+ from the parts store)
Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck.  I like this one.  Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality.belt was shipped fast. it is of great quality as usual from Goodyear.  it is of perfect size and fit for my truck.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
HAVE A LINC NAV AND THOUGH IT IS NOT TH BEST FIT IT WORKS, LETS I A BIT A SHINE BUT NOT MUCH, WISH THEY MADE TO HAVE A BETTER FIT FOR DIFFRENT AUTOS BUT THAN THAT WOULD NOT BEFEASABLE FOR THEM ITS GOODBOUGHT THIS FOR A REPLACEMENT TO THE OLD WHITE TANK COVER ON MY 31' COUGAR CAMPER. GREAT COLOR BUT NOT BRONZE, MORE OF A MEDIUM BROWN. I LIKE THE ACCESS ON TOP FOR THE VALVES. THE ONLY REASON FOR 4 STARS IS THE FACT THAT IT IS A 2 PIECE BOLT TOGETHER DESIGN. WOULD HAVE RATHER IT BEEN ALL 1 MOLDED PIECE FOR FIT AND FINISH.I READ ALL THE POS FEEDBACK ON THIS PRODUCT AND HAD TO TRY SOME..THIS STUFF DOES WORK WELL..I HAVE A 1996 FORD RANGER WITH A ROUGH IDLE..POURED SOME IN THE TANK..WITHIN A DAY OR 2..THE IDLE SMOOTHENED OUT..GOT TO USE IT EVERY NOW AND THEN TO KEEP THEM INJECTORS CLEAN..BETTER THAN ANY FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER I EVER USED..IT WORKS GUYS

I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections.No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used.

I love K&N filters.  I use them in all my cars. As soon as I buy a car I replace the filter with a K&N. Just buy a cleaner kit and clean as needed. Never will need replacing. Do not over oil the filter once you clean it and let it dry before reinstalling filter. If you over oil the filter, the oil can get into intake manifold and build up dirt.Don't waste your money on Fram filters. Mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of 5k miles.Fit my E39 528i perfectly. It also came with the correct o-ring to seal the oil filter housing. Just buy it already!Used this before & it cleans good. You don't need to over do it with the oil. Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying.
I use this exact filter on my 05 Honda Silver Wing. Honda recomends Torqing the filter. And the 17mm Nut makes it easy. Bought the bike used with about 2k miles. Rode 1500 miles and my oil is still clean. This is a Heavy filter for its size. Due to the steel case.I needed a decent filter wrench for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel.  The filter is up beside the engine and is best reached from below.  This wrench grips the round Amsoil Filter, Which is not wrench friendly with it's smooth surface. It holds the filter securely while I turn it with my 3/8&#34; ratchet using a nine&#34; extension.  Make sure you get the right size range for your filter size.a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.
Although it should be included for free with the Jack this item is a must have and reasonably priced.  Careful it's also easily stolen.This is a good low cost feeler gauge set that is suitable for your shop.  Recommend this one for most applications.Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too.
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug.  It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer.  The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew.  Even though this plug is only finger-tight.The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderDoes what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows.Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara. Simple install. Does what it is suppose to do.
My 2003 Silverado 1500 5.3 V* owners manual called for a GF626.....This is the EXACT same fit and goes on  easy. Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid...No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckFits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.
I have several of these on different batteries for both auto and boat. The tender lasts for years and in fact I have never had one quit working. Best price for these are always at Amazon too. Do not use a trickle charger to maintain your battery. Use this brand maintainer for great results.I needed this to clear my rear mounted spare tire for trailering. These were impossible to find locally but of course Amazon had them. A must have for SUV's with a rear mounted spare.I have ordered two of these for several projects and they are great! I would recommend them to anyone who is needing a charger for a battery...
This O2 sensor was a direct replacement for the original part.  Wire was the correct length and wires/plug matched original perfectly.  Easy install and I have seen a few MPG increase in fuel economy since installation.  The replacement of these sensors will also help ensure longer catalytic converter life.  Very happy with this purchase.The label on the box clearly says "Not for towing". This is used mainly for bike rack.Easy to install and quality is OK. It comes with a bolt and washer for securing the extension to your vehicle. The bolt and washer work together to prevent hitch extension from wobbling. So, it's like getting both the hitch extension and a wobbling stopper in one good price.In summary, it serves the intended purpose well with the addition of wobbling stopper. Good deal.Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.
Bought for a 2001 Maxima and it was a perfect fit. I like to keep my air cleaner really clean and this should serve my purpose well... I also bought the recharge kit which is also OEM K&N. Would recommend to anyone in the market for a K&N filter. :)This was exactly what I needed for transporting my fishing kayak in the bed of my F-150. Easy to assemble and works great!Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.
Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some numberThis item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.
Try to find a cabin air filter of this quality  anywhere near the price that it is being sold on Amazon. Replacement is easy (it's in the glove compartment) and your Honda  owners manual will show you how to do it.This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.
Take these saddle bags and the tail bag and your all set to go shopping,weekend away. One very nice feature is they don't dent or rust. You can easliy remove them anytime you want.just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didHad these in past years and then lost them somewhere.These things are perfect for frozen windows on cars.They get that ice off quick and do not harm the glass in any way.Amazon should be commended for offering these, you usually have to go to the auto supply shops to get these.Most times these shops in my locale don't have 'em on hand so you have to wait until they order them.Why not order them thru Amazon and get them with free shipping when enough items are ordered?Thank you Amazon
These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern.
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.These tools are a must have for anyone who works on the interior of their car. The sizes and shapes included in this kit are well thought out and prevent any scratches and gouges to your car's interior when you are removing plastic panels and pieces. These will pay for themselves, even if used just once, as replacement plastic pieces for car interiors are quite expensive.These are what is factory on many imports. My 2002 crv had a spec for these. They are great and long lasting plugs. They do need to be gap checked but mine were all perfect at .040. The plugs are great but be sure to put anti seize on the threads, The factory plugs called for replacement at 110K, and they were hard to get out because they were a bit corroded in the head. They came out and got replaced mpg went up slightly. hope this review helps.
Great price and better than most others I looked at. Rated at 6000  more than I need yet better to be safe than sorry.To my complete surprise, this was not only cheaper than the &#34;automotive store&#34; ones, and less than 1/4 what Toyota charges, it actually appears to be identical to the ultra-expensive OEM filter with lots of pleats. Pretty impressive for the price.Cobra CPI-A4000BC 4-AWG Heavy-Duty AC Power Inverter Cable KitWas cheaper to buy the already made kit than make your own.
The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.This is great oil - there's no debating that. Compared to normal prices in auto stores, this is a good deal as it gets the oil to your door for less than retail's 7.99 or so/quart.  That said, autozone and pep boys currently both have - and regularly have deals of 5  quarts plus a mobil 1 filter for $31...you do the math ;)
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.I put these on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon.  They look good and are doing well protecting the door sills.I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine.
Exact same filter they sell at walmart or an auto parts store.  Save the money and buy online isntead of paying more dollars for local purchase.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.

It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car

I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersHad to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.
I'm obliged to switch regularly between 1-7/8" and 2" balls on my hitch, and the Reese Interlock hitch balls make the swap a one-handed operation with the Reese Towpower hitch. That may not seem significant, but in inclement weather it allows you to hold an umbrella or tarp for protection and complete the swap with your remaining hand, in comparative comfort; the first time you have to change a ball in the rain, sleet or snow will sell you on one-handed swaps.To stress what other reviewers have said, when you order this "2 Pack" you get what you see in the picture: two chocks, not two sets of chocks.This is a good light-duty set of chocks. They are lightweight, made of durable plastic, and are stackable (like they are in the picture) to save space. They are also bright orange so you don't forget about them when the job is done.The bottom of the chock is slightly serrated, which will give it a decent grip on concrete and asphalt - just make sure you wedge them in well. I would not use these chocks on an incline, on a soft or uneven surface or on a vehicle with a bad parking brake, but for all your normal uses these should do the trick.The two chocks come attached with a plastic fastener. It's a boar to remove, so a pair of pliers is recommended. If you look closely at the picture, you can see holes pre-molded into the lower end of the chock. If you want to keep the two connected but still easily separated for use, I recommend a short length of twine.Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack.
Mounted on my tractor underneath the canopy to keep it out of the weather I can connect any type of accessory with the same connection.I connected my &#34;cigarette lighter&#34; volt meter to monitor my charging system but the outlet doesn't seem to maintain adequate contact to the plug.  The same voltage meter works just fine in my pickup truck but will not stay consistent while connected to this power outlet.The volt meter shows a less than full current flow until I press the plug into the socket and hold it there then it reads correctly.  The accessories that I have plugged into this outlet seem to work without issue.It works well enough that I give it 4 stars.  The housing is heavy polymer and should hold up well.The rubber outlet covers are adequate yet they can be easily lost if care is not taken when removing them.  The little rubber retaining rings only do so much .At first look, the Heininger 1020 CommuteMate Flameless Flare seems like a good idea. In certain limited circumstances, I'm sure it might be useful. For most circumstances, however, I would only use it as an absolute last resort.The item is made of plastic. Not just any plastic, but appears to be manufactured of the kind of hard plastic that quickly turns very brittle and cracks when exposed to the extreme temperature variations found inside a vehicle, which after all, is where this item is meant to be kept. While it is battery powered, and doesn't really pose any kind of roadside fire hazard, its usefulness is severely limited.First of all, one has to rely on always having it loaded with good batteries. Dead batteries do noone any good, and I've found most people just throw items like this in the trunk or glove box, and forget about it, not really thinking to check the batteries regularly.But does it work? Well yes, sort of. The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off, or lights up continuously. The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light, while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists. Unfortunately, the LED is not very bright, and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards, and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed, it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon. While we certainly don't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers, we also don't want something so dim that it doesn't trigger anyone's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway? Forget it, buy some reflective triangles. Rural highways? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds. Well lit neighborhoods? It likely won't get noticed. From my perspective, about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under, and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides. Then, if your vehicle's hazard flashers don't work, by all means this is better than absolutely nothing. Just remember to check the batteries.This helped tremendously to silence the water pump on my Jayco fifth wheel. Jayco had originally mounted PEX tubing directly to the pump so any vibration was transmitted directly into the walls. These flexible hoses help to reduce the amount of vibration transmitted. Though it does still get loud when its cold and the hoses stiffen. These hoses are quite long (about 20&#34;) so pay attention to available space. Its nice to not have water usage wake everyone up in the middle of the night!
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it.I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer.  Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure.  That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex.  This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again.A must for your RV water heater that requires and Anode Rod.  You should remove it at least once a year to be sure there is enough surface on the Anode Rod.  Will save replacing the the whole water heater if you fail to do this. A little difficult to remove and reinstall, but again worth the time and effort.
Very easy to work with.  I reconditioned my emergency battery that was beginning to get weaker.  I also reconditioned my auto battery on my 15 year old car (the battery is about 5 years old).When using is I recommend you plug it into a powerstrip that has a on/off switch.  You need to connect the unit to the battery and to avoid sparks it help to make the connection with the power switch off, then turn it on when everything is set.I have one on my motorcycle, and purchased this one to tend my trailer batteries through the winter. I went onto the Battery tender web site to find out how to hook up batteries in parallel so I can charge the 2 Marine deep cycle batteries that power my trailer. It is working great and looking at the diagrams I will be able to hook up my 2 spare trailer batteries in parallel for a total of 4 deep cycle batteries.With so many vehicles, I needed to replace my 25 year old unit.  This uses dual power, so at home I can plug into AC; on the road the 12 volt plug in my car.  I like the auto shut off feature when pressure achieved.
I bought this item for the battery tender .  Hook it up to the battery terminals and plug it in the battery tender.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road.Amazon provides a hard to find cleaning kit for the K&N auto air filters. Directions that come with the kit are a helpful reminder. There is enough Cleaner solvent and Oil for more than one cleaning. so it is an effective way to have clean filter for better fuel mileage w/o having to go out and find an OEM replacement
I almost bought aquapel because people were saying things like Rain-X only works for a few days, and you have to reapply it often. I've had it on my car for a month so far and I'd say it's 90% as good as the day I applied it. There's only a few small spots where it doesn't perfectly bead up, however it took about 2 minutes to reapply it this morning. I literally did it while my toast was in the toaster.Get a microfiber mitt and a full towel. Spray 3-5 sprays on the palm of the mitt and wipe it in a circular motion, overlapping a few times in each area. Once you go over your whole windshield, go over it with the big towel, I found if you use a mitt to try to wipe it off, it builds up on the mitt and just starts smearing instead of removing excess. It's a bit harder to wipe away ONLY on the first time. The first application may take 15 minutes so make sure you have time, but if you reapply it every month or two, it takes just a minute or two like I said earlier. You also learn the most efficient way to wipe it so you become faster every time you apply it. You could probably get down to 1 minute, and only then not lower because it needs to dry a little bit.ACTUAL EXPERIENCE: Now that you know how to get it on the right way, here's the actual review. It does exactly what it says and you barely need to use your windshield wipers at all unless it's a very fine mist or downpour.If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.I use several different SCHUMACHER CHARGERS and though some are over 8 years old and in CONSTANT USE ,maintaining and charging batteries ,they have yet to fail to do a great job . I do blow the dust out of them every few months to help them run cooler and wipe them clean once in a while.These lightweight chargers do heavyweight work. You just set the battery TYPE and AMPERAGE that you want to limit ...then let the charger do the job...it will charge automatically and then go into a MAINTENANCE MODE so as to not over-charge your battery .
This is the only oil I've used in my Harley's for many many years.  It does what it's designed to do and it does it very well.  Great stuff.Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks.What can you say about JB Weld that hasn't already been said before? This stuff works wonders on just about everything, and if it doesn't they make specific weld kits for wood and plastic.
good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.Pricey but you get what you pay for.  Sturdy.  Handy.  Durable.  Ordered some &#34;cheaper&#34; velcro straps and they were worth what I paid.  Can't go wrong with these.OEM fuel filter, why buy aftermarket when you can have quality GM replacement for way less than dealer price! Keep your GM all GM!!!
I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup.I read the instructions throughly and referred back as I was going through the process. The equipment is well made, and the key thing I learned after a lot of trial and error is that it would not work if I had the base unit too tight against the windshield. Part of the directions say that when you tighten down the tightening/driving screw that pushes the product into the crack, the rubber tip of the alignment device should "open".  If you have the bottom part too tight against the windshield, it won't "open" and thus your crack won't get filled with the liquid. Loosening the bottom allowed this to happen.I had a 1/2 inch crack starting in a line from a rock impact. The directions said to start with 4 - 6 drops, I did. After about 24 drops, the crack was filled. Keep cycling through drops, drive it in, remove the screw, more drops. The more you remove and replace the screw liquid driver, the more it drives it into the crack.My crack was very small, I thought, yet it took 24 drops of liquid to get the liquid flowing into the crack.By the time you master this artistic but very fruitful process, you'll be an expert and can offer tips to anyone!First of all, the install was a breeze.  It was done in less than 3 minutes.  Had the fit been more snug, one minute is all it will take.The part arrived no problem.  No problem opening it.  The carbon filter bits somehow don't seem to be well inserted between the paper filters.The air-flow label is difficult to see (very light print on) and it's not printed on the same side as the OEM ones.  The OEM ones have the air flow label clearly facing you as you pull out the filter tray/drawer.  But this one came with the label to the side, so it was confusing if I should use that as an indicator and turn the filter 90% with the label facing me and install it.  But when I do that, it clearly does not fit in to the tray.Also, the leaflet folding part in the filter didn't fit quite well when trying to insert into the tray.  You almost have to force it and pull from the other side while trying to make sure no part is blocked by the tray (there's a little thing in the tray that's in the way of the filter).It's not designed at 100% fit in my opinion, but I'd say it's a 98% fit quality.As for filtering power, I noticed the air is cleaner in the cabin.  The odor filter function is noticeably there, but when the car in front of you has a smog issue, you still need to shut the vent to recycle inside air only.For the price, I would buy it and easily install it on an annual basis.  The dealer would charge you at least $30 to 50 and some even $120 to install a filter like this.  Save money, DIY!!!
It is just what it is supposed to be and I am satisfied. There is no way to tell if it will fall apart quickly or last forever so that is all I can say.I actually thought it was to be "the ultimate" and even though it is actually ok is not such an ultimate thing.How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...
This digital tire gauge drains battery even if you are not using it.I checked my tires once a month, but, I already have to change battery about once per year.The gauge still use power to memoris the pre-setting of tire pressure. come to think about it, thepre-set memory is useless if you have 2 different cars. (Because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting). The 2032 lithiumX2 battery is not cheap, I expect it should last at least 5 years.Many automobile manufacturers, including BMW, claim that the transmission oil is a &#34;lifetime fill&#34; in order to avoid the expense of replacing it during their &#34;free scheduled maintenance&#34; period. Strangely, that recommendation only happened after they started paying for that maintenance. You really do need to replace manual, and automatic, transmission oil every 30,000 miles if you want it to last a while. This is the oil to use for virtually all manual transmissions that don't take ATF.I gave these things a 2 star rating because we have 8 sets of them installed on our county patrol cars.  Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate.  I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night, 01/23.2014.  Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time.  Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue.  Other than that, they are a great, powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you.  Be safe and maybe look for another type of light that will give you longer service life before you spend the money on these.
Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter.installed the unit in an BMW e46 320D Wagon and the unit works ok... but sometimes you get that wiper switch slap you dont with other brands.... install Valeo brand instead if you can..!If you have never used a clay bar on your car - buy this kit.  You will be amazed at the results.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.
The small size of this drainer is perfect for any camper.  The little cut-out on the bottom fits over the edge of the sink.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.the nut fitting is the perfect answer to the cramped space inside the vx cruiser--way better than the OEM.  Excellent product from K&N.
Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me.
This windshield wiper arm puller is super simple and just does the job. I used this to pull off an old rear window wiper arm from my Buick Rendezvous. Granted the stud is only 1/2 inch, so it isn't that massive front window arm, but the arm popped off way easier than I ever imagined.The tool is good metal, it appears to be solid construction for what I'd expect at $12 - it isn't Snap On or Facom, but it does the job. If the plastic knob ever broke off, it would incredibly easy to unscrew the center bolt, add another nut to the top of the bolt, and use a wrench to turn the nut. That's about a 2 minute fix, OK, maybe 10 minutes including time at the hardware store. But the puller is totally usable even if the handle were to break.I had no problem with the plastic handle. It appeared to be reasonably solid. The end of the bolt has a nice rounded face to keep the bolt centered on the wiper arm post.It took maybe a minute to figure out how to turn the base around to grab the wiper arm.Overall, I like the idea of using this as opposed to pry bars or other things with the risk of cracking the windshield. This is a good reasonably priced tool.Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.I wanted an air compressor to keep my car tires inflated proper. This one does the job.  You can set it and it will turn off when the tire has the proper PSI. I use an air gauge to check behind it. Yes, it has a short AC cable but most everybody has an extension cord in their garage and if the cord was longer the unit would not be compact. The DC cord is long enough. A good buy
This is a great quality -  made in the USA tire inflator.The ONLY problem I have found is this model does NOT have a deflate feature, the only was to lower the pressure is to raise the chuck up off the stem slightly to allow the air to leak out.I never noticed any unusual odor. This product is rugged, functional, and looks great (in a sporty utilitarian sort of way). I use it in a 2007 Lincoln Town Car that has a shallow shelf space in the back of the trunk right beneath the rear window. It fits up there as if it was designed for the car. The lining in my trunk is kind of like thin carpet, and this organizer totally stays put -- no sliding at all. The price is on the high side but the design and manufacturing quality are great. I'm 100% satisfied with my purchase.Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number
If you want to help your cooling system be more efficent,Then this product is what you need. 1oz per quart of cooling system . And watch the temp drop. Must have for better cooling.Nice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps.Will last for a long time. A great price. This is really something that will extend the life of any gas powered engine. Use the blue which is better than the pink. Remember you get what you pay for.
This is a life saver when your regular tires won't grip the ice or the snow.  They're easy to put on and they come with a nice storage carry bagCall me a fan...this Gorilla Automotive telescoping wrench works as designed.  Nice that it comes with lug sockets.  Used it when I changed into my winter wheels.  Nice and compact and the telescoping handle provides good leverage to take of the lug nuts.Extremely nice heavy duty comes with a debris cover for the lock mechanism as well, the utube videos showing  bic pen is a load of crap as well, unless you have the key it isn't coming off.
I used this on the exhaust header of my 97 Miata.I painted this on top of a self etching primer and then wrapped the header in DEI Titanium wrap.The Good;Easy to apply, does not run easilyHeatproof, did not burn when tested on a grillInexpensiveThe Bad;Flaked during useI would buy Ace Hardware High Temp Paint instead, I've had much better luck with that overallbought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower.Great replacement product. ease of installation. added while doing a tune up on my Tahoe for the new spark plugs as well. comes with the grease your need, don't have to buy any extra. Very happy with the product, it works and has given my engine a little power back. would buy again.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.Does everything. I can see when the tanks flush out clean. Has a valve so you can easily flush a tank and do it again if it needs more. Flush out the sewer hose when you are done. Should be standard item on a new RV.
Recently I had a steel garage door installed. Opening and closing the door was a noisy event. I called the installer and was told that the hinges needed to go through a break-in stage and to reduce the noise a 20 weight oil was recommended. I applied a dab of Royal Purple Synthetic Engine Motor Oil 20W50 on each hinge and the results far exceeded my expectations. The door opening and closing was the quietest it has ever been including when the old door was still in use. This is an excellent lubricant.The 2004 Toyota Highlander came with a pathetic horn that couldn't be heard above the purr of a kitten. After a couple of near-death experiences it had to go. This Bad Boy turned out to be a good replacement. It's two-tone sound hits both frequencies loudly and with gusto. Although not the horn of an eighteen wheeler it is still a great improvement over the factory crap. The directions were good even though the print was microscopic. The fit was fine but the removal of the Highlanders grill was not a cake walk. Of course that had nothing to do with the horn itself. Just hope this horn lasts because I never want to remove that grill again.Highly recommended.We have an outdoor security camera with a dome enclosure. When it rained, water would bead up in the middle of the dome - which happened to be the center of the camera lens.I applied this 3 months ago and have had no problems since, the water beads and rolls off the dome.
this has been a must have in the detailing word. This holds SO much water and comes with a nice container to stow it away.  Quality and works excellent, does not scratch.  NEVER use another brand!Was very impressed with the sturdy design. This is a work horse, and with the built in pressure gauge you will find it helpful. Bag holds the unit in a neat manner. YOU can't go wrong with this.this is perfect for my truck the one that came with truck is very small and is difficult to remove lug nuts. with this its a breeze.like other reviews say the bag to hold the items that comes with this is very cheap and is probably not going to last to long but its not a deal breaker for me i don't need the bag.
I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular.The K&N HP oil filters are the model of K&N with the 1&#34; nut on the end so that you don't need an oil filter wrench. If you're a DIY person you will appreciate being able to tighten/loosen this in a small space  where it is very hard to get a standard oil filter wrench of any kind. All you need is a 1&#34; wrench. This particular size fits my Miata and the filter is squeezed into a tiny engine cavity where access is very limited. This filter is a breeze to install or remove from above the car. The K&N brand is made by the same company that makes Mobil1 oil filters and that is as good as it gets. I highly recommend this filter for Miata owners and I recommend K&N HP (with the nut) and PS (without the nut) for all vehicles. The quality is excellent and Amazon has the best prices.The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility.
bought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed.This did not do much for perfomance...the original plug works much better.  I use this plug now as a back up.I bought this cover to use as a dust protector for my spare motorcycle that does not get much use. Because it is kept in doors I did not need a heavy duty cover. It does not appear that it would do well if put on a hot bike as the material is thin.For the price it is a good value, and it serves my purpose.Also Amazon's excellent service made me buy it.
My screen door is metal insert and this closure kit will not work to close it without major modifications. Cannot recommend. The manufacturer could be clearer as to where and how this works because I see a lot of RVs where I live where this type of device is useless and people waste money buying it.Maybe its just me, but I didn't see much difference.  I have a 2010 370Z that I baby, and decided after three years it might be time to detail the finish.  As I said, I baby the darn thing so its garage kept and pretty clean to start with.  I followed the long, involved instructions written by one of the experienced reviewers to the letter. I decided to just do the hood, and then clean/wax the rest of the car for comparison. .  I could see some different in the hood.  It was definitely a higher gloss.  But not a difference that any one else would notice.  Maybe it would be more noticeable in an older car with faded paint.  But I wouldn't waste time doing this again.I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost.
Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom?
I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.Very neat tool to remove battery post without twisting or jerking cables try to pull them out from battery .This tool also can be used to remove windshield wiper arms or other small job need to slowly easy to pull out the part. Good to have in tool box, special for mechanic use to replace battery when remove cables .I used this product in conjunction with an appropriate primer and clearcoat, all from VHT, to paint my car's brake calipers bright glossy red.step 1) remove brake dust, grease, and rust using a brake caliper cleaning agent of some kind.  Also use a wire brush if you can.step 2) Sand your calipers using 320-grit sandpaper.  Really rough them up.  Then use some more brake cleaner.step 3) Mask off your car's corner  body panels, the wheel wells, the struts and hoses, and finally, the brake rotors.  Take the time to mask the bleed valves on the calipers too.step 4) Apply primer to the caliper in a very light, speckled coat, then move to the next caliper until you've applied a coat to all 4.  Do this 4 times, gradually getting heavier, but avoid letting the paint run (it's okay if it happens in the primer).  Try to do this as quickly as possible.step 5) Apply your base color (THIS PRODUCT) using the same method as in step 4: light coats multiple times.  I suggest a sweeping method, rather than just spraying hard.  Do NOT allow the base color to run.step 6) Apply a clear coat using the same method as in steps 4 and 5, but be careful not to overdo it.  Clear coats can run more easily than base colors.  The paint should be looking thick and glossy by this time.step 7) Wait an hour. Drink a beer or something.step 8) Remove your masking.  Gaze upon your new calipers.  Then, use some brake cleaner to remove any overspray from the brake rotors or undercarriage areas.  Do NOT use brake cleaner to clean body panels, as it will probably remove the paint.step 9) put your wheels back on.  wait a few more hours.  THEN drive your car pretty hard, making sure to go fast, and brake hard.  This will heat your brakes up.  The paint needs to cure at 200F, which means you need to drive and brake repeatedly.  Don't go too nuts.That's it!  All finished.
This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct.The only reason this doesn't receive five stars is because it can be used in only one direction.  This isn't a problem, yet, but over time, it's going to wear on one side of the tool than the other.  Additionally, you may want to use a different direction on your drill, the typical tool in which to mount this polishing ball, and you can't use reverse on a drill with this polishing ball.Still, with this, about a teaspoon of plastic scratch remover (used on pinball machine playfields to polish them) and 10 minutes of prep/cleanup per headlight, this little ball got the somewhat cloudy headlight lenses on my wife's car back to crystal clear.  Sure, I could have done the same thing with 1,500 and 2,000 grit sandpaper, which I have, but this was much quicker, not messy, and took almost no effort.Now...to polish the rather large aluminum wheels on our diesel-pusher motorhome.  At least this will make it less of a chore.I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to clean.  It's almost spongy in its texture.I was extremely disappointed in this item. Most of the Camco stuff I have is pretty good, but the problem with this meter is the clear plastic face is not static proof.When comparing with my Fluke multimeter, this meter reads about 2VAC high at 120VAC; or about 1.6% off.When you get the meter, it has a piece of protective plastic over the bezel, and just removing it will induce enough static electricity to cause the pointer to change.  And if you brush across the bezel with your finger, you can make it read anywhere from 110V to 130V, because the static electricity affects the needle.Most meters use a plastic bezel that is immune to static, and does not do this. I don't know if the problem is the plastic the manufacturer used or perhaps they failed to treat it with some chemical.Sadly there are not a lot of options for other brands. I like an analog meter in this case as you can see voltage fluctuations a whole lot better than you can with a digital meter.Hopefully over time this meter will lose it's sensitivity to static electricity.
Must have if you own one a Toyota that uses 64mm oil filters.This is the tool that will fit, many other socket wrenches on the market is either 64.5mm or 65mm, some may workBut more often then not, they slips and cant loosen nor tighten the filters enough.Cat in one piece aluminum, not assembled by spot welding pressed sheet metal. So it will do the job and wont break apart.Definite professional grade.Now that the Feds have required TEN PERCENT of our gasoline have ethanol(corn extract)which, when added to gasoline can be destructive to antique cars engines, I can successfuly run my antique vehicle without fear of engine dammage...a WONDERFUL product.I like the style of the gun ,it is well designed and u can get into places with it that some others can't
You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.Works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower!It even has a lip on the top so the oil won't go out of the funnel.The only problem with funnels is, you never know how full the chamber is,and always need to remove the funnel to look. Someone should invent a meter on the funnel, that helps in overflowing,and an end valve in case the chamber is full, to prevent it from overflowing.But until then, this funnel will do just fine!This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.
Don't go RV'ing without one of these.  Many campgrounds use well water and it often tastes bad.  This filter elliminates that and gives you tasty, drinkable water at every facet.  Connect this directly to your water pressure regulator, and then to the hose, so your rv hose does not accumulate the nasty water tastes as well.  Don't forget to use it when you fill your fresh water tank as well...Used this before & it cleans good. You don't need to over do it with the oil. Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying.I did not smell any sent of Fresh Breeze, the filter is thicker than the oem filter and hope it will last as long and will not restrict the air flow due to its thickness. So far it has not restricted the air flow after a few weeks but still never had a fresh sent.
Most products I've tried have left the nasty white streaks on my windshield when I turn on my wipers.  Not this stuff.  I actually added it to RainX Bug Wash the first time.  Then I added it to plain water when I ran the bug wash out.  Both times it left my windshield perfectly waterproof.  Best time to use it is when it's dry.  If you use it when it's raining it'll bounce off the water instead of going into the windshield.  I just spray a splash or two every time I start my car that way it's always ready in case it rains.  And when the thunderstorms come and people are pulling off the side of the road because their wipers can't keep up, you won't barely even need wipers since the rain beads up and runs off.  Perfect product!The floor liners fit perfectly and trap almost everything my shoes drag into my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.  I live on a dirt road, so even my leather sole dress shoes seem to drop dirt and gravel into my floor boards.  All I have to do is pull them out, shake them a little bit to remove gravel and dirt, or spray them with water if they get muddy.  I would highly recommend the Husky brand liners.  I think they have a lifetime warranty, too!Worked wonders on old, old dried in dirty grease. I wanted this to try to clean a rug I have that I haven't been able to use for years. It is a super thick, tightly woven 100% wool rug with a great kitchen design of fruits and veggies in full color on a black back ground. Well.....9 years ago I spilled an entire vat of hot dirty deep fat frying grease on it and it completely soaked through. I also got very sick about that time and didn't get around to trying to clean if for at least 90 days and the grease had dried into it. I tried saturating it with other cleaners and Tide ans Wisk laundry detergents hoping it would get the grease out but it didn't. I didn't have the heart to throw it out so I held onto it all this time and I'm glad I did. That little throw rug cost $190 and I sprayed enough of this KRUD on it so it soaked through out the rug, let it sit for a few hours and all I did then was scrub it lighlty with a toilet bowl brush and it got all the grease loosened up and then I rinsed it out in the tub. It took a few days for it to dry because it is that thick but now I have it back in the kitchen and am loving having it back...... I then tried to remove old dried in yellow oil stain that had come from my washing machine when I washed too heavy of a load so the oil came from the machine and got into my favorite powder blue sweat shirt, and again, I tried Tide, Wisk and other cleaners and they didn't get any of it out, I sprayed KRUD on the spots, let it soak in and left it for an hour, then rinsed it out and the stain was gone....I'm thrilled. Between the rug and the sweatshirt this KRUD has saved me $230. They should call it "GOLD" not KRUD. I'm going to buy it by the gallon so I always have it on hand. You should too.
When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it!Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look!I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.
Very good purchase for the money. Very good quality and worth what I paid. Like I said in the title, it's huge. I can get the zippers to about 2 inches apart with a 3X motocross helmet with the visor attached. If I take the visor off, it has plenty of room to spare. I don't think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag.I use an &#34;AFX FX-17 size 3X&#34; sold here on Amazon, if you want to see what visor I'm talking about.I like that once my helmet, goggles and gloves are dry I can store them all in this bag.At less than $100, it's not much more than twice the price of one puller.  I had a stuck ball joint and got this and the ball joint puller was too small but one of the pitman arm pullers was just right.  So it lets you separate a lot of things in different situations without spending a lot of money.Everything is organized well in a sturdy plastic case.  Unlike some cases, this one is big enough that you don't have to turn the screws all the way in to fit the tools in the case.Very impressed at the price and selection.  It's not something I'll use every day but it's something that is nice to have when it's needed.  Besides, if I ever get a new car, I could probably sell this for at least what I paid for it.while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.
I own a black car in the northwest, so let's just say I know a thing or two about cleaning a car. You'd be amazed at how much dirt and sand gets trapped below these in a bucket. These fit a standard 5-Gallon bucket perfectly; Lowes or Home Depot buckets work just fine. This is definitely a must have item for anyone who washes their own car and wants to keep the finish clean and swirl free.Given as a gift to my son in law and one for myself,this wrench does a great job of getting the filter off with ease.I would recommend it to every one that needs a good filter wrench.I use this in a sprayer with a bit of water for dilution. It smells nice, like bubble gum. :-)
Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter.If you decide to get this I also rcomend you get some lengths of gutter, at least 2 pieces, you can lay in on the expanded matrix so the gutter hose will not fall between the expanded sectiond.  So this and you have a great working system.If you have a camper or RV why wait until you need one?  Seriously - driving under trees in campgrounds it's only a matter of time until you tear off the factory plumbing vent cap.  And you won't notice it at the campsite, you usually notice it later, when you're nowhere near a place to buy a replacement at any kind of reasonable price.  But one now - store it away - take it with you.  Then, look up, on your camper or RV's roof - what's that?  The vent cap is missing?  Now you've got one in your emergency repair kit.
this is the cleaner and oil for kn, what more do you want? finger will hurt after using the spray bottle, so pony up more for the regular hand sprayer or aerosol type or even put the cleaner in a hand sprayer yourself. Be innovative people..Do yourself a HUGE favor and use a mass flow (MAF) senor cleaner to clean the MAF sensor.  DON'T use carburetor, fuel injector or throttle body cleaner or you'll ruin the MAF sensor.A great product for those who stay in areas / condos where a water hose may not be available. Can be used as a clay lubricant and quick detailer in higher concentration. If your vehicle does not have lot of grime and mud etc which needs to be hosed off this is an ideal product to get. Good for regular cleaning between waxing. Does not strip off wax or sealant. Great water saver. Keep a few microfiber towels handy to dry the vehicle, take care to rinse clean the cloth as you work.
Easy to apply and lasts a long time. Works well on tires, black rubber bumpers & trim.My problem (and it's just me) is the product is a bit too shiny for my liking.  It's a personal preference. If shiny is what you're looking for then this is it.Meguires makes great product and I've got a garage full of their stuff.This stuff is easy to use, and really works well. Anybody that is a car nut, will use this stuff, and for good reason, it's a great product.I like using this mitt - I use it for waxing not washing... It's not great for initially working in wax - you can't beat a good microfiber cloth for that, but for a solid once over afterwards, this is a great mitt.
As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.I've used this product many times in the past but each time I did it was the small bottle included with the filter that I used. This stuff is exactly the same as the smaller bottle and therefore works the same, which is to say very well. You spray it on the filter, let it sit for 10 minutes or so and rinse with water. There are two benefits to the larger bottle. First is that it is more economical. I have four vehicles with cotton oiled air filters and this bottle should last a fairly long time. Also, it is much easier to spray into the filter than with the smaller bottle. I also feel because it is easier to spray and direct you will use a little less cleaner your filter which should make it an even better value yet.I much prefer this version to the pump version. It's nice and easy to just use the self propelled spray to re oil the filter. Nice that it's bigger than the one that comes in the kit too.
Slime is a really great product.  You can use it on any tire from your garden tiller to your SUV.  The bottles come in different sizes to cover a range of tire sizes.  You need to own some sort of tire pump to apply this product to the tire and usually that means some sort of air compressor.  A bicycle pump will work for bike tires, though.Slime doesn't have a pressurized propellant in the bottle, so there's no danger to you or to a tire technician.  It can be a little messy if you decide to remove a tire from its rim.  A small price to pay for a safe and effective product.No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.I was going to buy a few of these but found them priced $3 lower for the 3 packs on another online dealer....that's why i took off a star.I love these towels, they are the right size to buff my cars when using a detail spray or spray wax. You can fold over several times when detailing your car....It has the right thickness to wipe up detail spray or spray wax. It can also clean glass to a crytal clear finish with just water & a lil vinegar.If you're serious about making your car look fantastic, you need to get these.
If you work on dirty/greasy stuff, you need this.Gritty, to get the grunge out of your fingerprints/creases, doesn't smell odd, and it dissolves grease like you would not believe.  One cleaning, and you're likely done, even if your hands could double as pumpkin lube. (automotive reference)Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.If you wash your vehicle alot and care about scratching your finish with the dirt in your wash, then you definitely need one of these. Better yet, you need 2 of these - one for your wash bucket and one for your rinse bucket. I didn't think something like this would make much difference, but it sure does! Would recommend this grit guard for anyone that does alot of self washing of their vehicle.
The floor liners fit perfectly and trap almost everything my shoes drag into my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.  I live on a dirt road, so even my leather sole dress shoes seem to drop dirt and gravel into my floor boards.  All I have to do is pull them out, shake them a little bit to remove gravel and dirt, or spray them with water if they get muddy.  I would highly recommend the Husky brand liners.  I think they have a lifetime warranty, too!I've read other reviews where some say that this does not stay in place.  I installed two in my garage, one on each side, for both my vehicles. After marking the optimum spot on my garage floor where I wanted my vehicles to be clearance-wise, I cleaned the floor to remove any/all dirt and grease.  Then, since my floor was pretty cold because it is still winter here in Colorado, I used my creme brulee torch to heat up the concrete so that the tape would bond with the floor better. After placing the parking stop on the floor, I parked my car on top of it over night.  This step might have been overkill, but I wanted to make sure the tape made good contact and bond with the floor.  After over a month of use, both stops are still in place and we are pleased that we can park our vehicles in the same place every time. In summary, take care to find the optimum place to install on your garage floor, prep the floor properly, and this parking stop will work great.Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage, from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges. I need to buy another pack though, for the back doors protection too, as it is not long enough for both doors. We don't need it for the back doors very often, but I think it will come in handy at times. Since we like this so much, we will be buying another.
What can i say.  It holds oil.  Multiple oil changes before I have to take it to empty it.  Some people complained about the cap.  Its not the greatest cap in the world, but its ok.  I only use this in my home garage for 2 vehicle oil changes.  Its not that big of a deal for how seldom I use it.  If you are a professional mechanic then you probably have a better solution to hold used oil.Yea its good wax for the money and gives your car the protection your car needs. Reason why I say that is, I go by how it beads up when it rain. NOW having said that I waxed my car 1 month ago, I will see how long the shine and the beading lasts. If not just move on and try a different product.I normally use the smaller recharge kit (white bottle) but since i ran out, I bought this spray and the bigger oil can to match. I used it on a k&n filter I had never cleaned and unlike the other white bottle cleaner, it did not completely remove the oil, so it is hard to say I'm 100% satisfied. I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter. Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be, but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it won't be for a while. Since i don't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular (non synthetic) k&n filter cleaner, if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that. In this case the problem could be the filter, I have bought a few of the white recharge kits so I know how to clean filters. Time will tell
This was the coolest engine color ever used by a manufacturer. Pontiac used this color from 1966-1970 for both their V8's and straight 6's. Pontiac used other shades of blue through the years, though this blue stands out with the metallic flake. As the previous review notes, apply in thin coats, it goes on a lot easier if you do. You can apply normal coats anywhere there is casting but on flat surfaces you really need to apply light coats.If you're cleaning up or rebuilding a Pontiac motor, there's no law that says you have to paint it the correct blue for the engine/car's year. I'm using this color on a 77' 400, and the motor is going into a 1981 Trans Am!Don't forget to useDupli-Color DE1612 Engine primerfirst! This is especially important on non-course surfaces.Heads Up: Pontiac heads will eventually burn off the paint applied along the exhaust ports. From the past 2 years of car shows I've been to, I haven't seen a single Pontiac where the paint isn't burned off over those ports. The only thing I have seen that did work is someone used a cast iron exhaust manifold higher temp paint along the exhaust runners, which looked as if it was part of the exhaust manifolds. As far as I am concerned, these burned off spots are your tiger's stripes and they belong there if your a serious Pontiac owner!Until you use it you can not comment on it.Others have told me it works great for getting a flat fixed until you can make it to a repair shop.I have never had a flat or needed to use anything like this before.But wanted it for my Harley Sportster.  Better to have it than call a tow truck.originally bought to fix seal around engine compartment cover on a boat. since used it to fix my rubber boots, re-attach loose weather seals on my car, and fixed a few other things that would normally need rubber cement to fix. this glue works amazingly well and can use thick beads and still have durability
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.plan to attach to the doors of my truck.  i will fill you in on the value of the product once it goes in use.  they look good on sight though.You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.
Nice thick applicator, use to apply polish on car then use the other one to apply wax. Only washed once, seemed to be alright, would buy againTo keep plastic water pipes from freezing in winter, this device is used to blow any excess water out the pipes.  Easier to use and cheaper than using marine antifreeze.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderjust  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didThese worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.
I think meguiars is the best product for the price on the market today, you cant go wrong with all of the items they sell just read the directions first.The directions are poorly written....the process did not work for me. I was very disappointed after reading so many positive reviews.It does the trick - easy to use and not only gives the OBD2 code but also the name for the code so you have some idea of the problem before you research it.When I followed the web link through the software for more information, it asked for VIN and License numbers and had some 15+ diagnostic questions.  I was expecting a more complete analysis after going through all that, but found it wanted $9.95 for a more comprehensive report that would include possible causes and troubleshooting info, which you can find on other web sites through search engines.I would have liked the product to include a concise Quick-start guide, and for the users manual to include a list of codes and brief descriptions.  I didn't find the documentation to be user-friendly.If all you want is a tool to read the code, this is the tool for you.  To make the results useful, you'll need to research the code on the internet.
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same carI purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM!
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.

I replaced a rear sensor in a 1999 camry 4 cyl with this sensor to eliminate a check engine light failure.  It was easier than using an identical replacement because the cable ran through the floor pan under the driver's seat.  By using this I just cut the wires underneath the car, spliced them with included splices and heat shrink and added a layer of self-sealing rubber tape to protect and waterproof the splices.  No more check engine light for about $30.Update: Replaced the rear sensor on my 1998 camry also with perfect success - they went bad on both cars at around 120000 miles.I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was "lost" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O. No explaination was given when I contacted the company. Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance. My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra. The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota's optional "tow package". Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long. The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way. Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal. If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake. If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good..

Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.Great, versatile oil filter.  I have a Passat and couldnt find a wrench to fit it easily. Bought this and it works great.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern.We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2
I really do like beam style wipers. They don't rust. They look nicer than the old fashioned style of wiper and they perform better in most instances... except this one.The 22" ANCO Contour wiper I mounted on the driver's side of my 2007 Hyundai Accent (a parts match fit according to Amazon's part finder) won't conform completely or correctly to the curvature of the windshield. It leaves a section of the windshield partially wiped putting a streak of water a couple inches wide and right in my line of sight. I've tried cleaning the window and wiping down the blade but nothing solves the issue. A visual inspection of the 22" blade reveals no physical defects or flaws.The 16" ANCO Contour blade I have installed on the passenger side of my Accent clears the window without this problem.I have also noticed that at highway speeds above 65 MPH both blades seem to lift off the windshield and are less effective at clearing water away even though these blades have a spoiler built into them to cut down on this high speed problem.I really wanted to like these blades. They fit on my car without the need of a bulky and unsightly adapter like some other brands require you to use. Unfortunately looks aren't really an important feature in a wiper blade, performance is. And unfortunately these blades... just don't cut it.{Update}After just a couple weeks on the vehicle the 22" wiper on the driver's side is leaving a four to six inch wide section of the windshield, right in my line of sight, only partially cleared. Review dropped to one star, blades tossed in the trash.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.
I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff.I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine.The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.These are well-priced, heavy stabilizing jacks.  We bought them so we would have four stabilizers on our Casita trailer instead of just the two that came on the trailer.ZERO complaints.  The jacks are heavy, easy to use and do the job.One thing - they are marketed by amazon along with some "jack pads" to place underneath them on the ground.  The tripod base of this particular jack does NOT fit on the plastic jack pads.I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror.
Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.These are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.These are some nice door guards. Just locate them carefully and stick them in position with the adhesive tape that's already there. they look good and are reasonably priced.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.This tool requires the use of anti-sieze compound when chasing the threads.  Doing this gets the rust and crud out of the threads.  This is a must for proper seating and sealing of the O2 sensor.While BMW claims the differential oil is a &#34;lifetime&#34; fill, replacing the oil periodically (30 to 50,000 mile intervals) will prolong the life of the drivetrain.  And the Red Line product is the best there is.
I wanted to use this to fill transmission oil into the transmission after performing a filter change and dropping the transmission pan. It broke not even after putting 2 quarts in the pan.. Needless to say that I was not happy as I had to WALK to the next car store to buy a replacement since I coudl not drive with only 2 quarts in the tranny. Buy 2 or 3 to be on the safe side if one fails or use a different solution to begin with. I am using a funnel from now on in combination with a longer plastic tube going down from over the engine.I purchased 2 packages of these coil compressors (so 4 compressors total) a while back knowing i would need them to swap out a set of springs from 1998 Chev Camaro.  I was installing shocks and lowering coils to improve handling and get rid of some body roll.  On the Camaro, the rear is a solid axle so the coils and shocks install separately (its not a coil over shock system as in the front).  While compressing the rear spring, I ran out of room...the threaded bar portion was making contact with the top of the coil's housing so i used the extra 2 compressors i had to compress the coil further until i could remove it...So the compressors did their job easily. its a good product and very well made however, you may need 3-4 of these compressors to help further compress the coils.on the front, the coils and shocks were out of the car so no space issues and two compressors easily compressed the coil...i used 3 to be safe.I also use mine to power my NorthStar 16 gal. yard spayer. I can spray two tanks full before the JNC runs down.
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.What can I say, it's a funnel.  Does the job as expected. Has a nice large fill hole so the liquids go in quickly.Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road.  Sand = Nope. Mud = Nope.  Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly. (I know from experience - ugh)
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Bought this to use with electrical connections on a tail light assembly for a cargo carrier.  It works as described and was a good price.  This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower.
Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display. Yes, a little air does escape but my unit was always able to make a good seal in a fraction of a second. For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear. I can't think of a practical use for the 'flashlight' feature - it stays on only while the power button is pressed - but there may come a day I will be grateful it was there.I find this gage to perform well and, so far, I was able to operate it without any trouble. I understand that it's possible to perform the exact same readings with a near-free 'analog' gauge but I believe that the added precision and convenience are worth this item's price. However, I will take out one star and rate this gauge as a 4-star mainly for the somewhat misleading '5-year warranty' claim, prominently displayed on the packaging. Given that 'in real life' the customer would pay more for shipping back and forth than it would cost to purchase a brand-new unit the warranty promise, whether 5-year or double-lifetime as quite meaningless.
This is perhaps one of the best air chucks you can buy. True, it isn't cheap and you get what you pay for.Unfortunately though, it does not work 100% on the dualies on my motorhome, which is why I bought it. Turns out, I need the chuck version that has a straight inner tire chuck and angled outer tire chuck. This item has both angled inner and outer chucks.But I can buy a replacement chuck (which Amazon does not sell), or a combination chuck with 12&#34; hose (which Amazon does sell), so I can retrofit the chuck for my type dualie setup.I am giving it 5 stars because I simply ordered the wrong item, so I am not going to gig the product because of that. Amazon though could describe the products a bit better rather than making me go to the vendor's website and looking up the product number to see which one is what I need.I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks.Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck.
Seems Well Made, You will need a regular Shop extension cord to use this. I use this to power a Macerator to pump out my RV Tanks into a holding tank in my pick up truck bed and then drive to the dump station so I don't have to tow my poop wagon at 2 miles an hour thru the gravel in the campground. I have not actually jumed a vehicle with this , but I did test it on my battery start tester and it performed very well.Good Cables and Clamps, I suspected the accuracy of the gauge but checked it against my Fluke Meter and it is pretty close.Buy this right now.  I had a performance K&N; filter set-up on my Acura, but for some reason it never occurred to me to put a K&N; filter on my commuter car.  It popped up as a suggestion, and I purchased it immediately.  Right away I noticed snappier acceleration.  At the end of my 22 mile commute my mileage had already improved .5 mpg without resetting the computer.  I am floored.  I am fresh out of a dyno so I don't know if my HP increased, but based on my other two observations, combined with this being a lifetime product, I am ecstatic about this filter.Now, a little story about replacing my old filter with the K&N.;  I thought I was just going to open the air box, yank out the old one, slap in the K&N;, and then go about my day.  WRONG.  Big ol' thumbs down for Nissan making routine task a big undertaking.  If you have an Altima you had better get out your awesomeStanley 92-839 Black Chrome and Laser Etched Socket Set, 99-Piece.  Use your short 10mm and remove the intake hose from where it attaches to the box.  Then you can unclip the front clips, and the lid flips up.  You can unclip the sensor, but I did not.  Thank goodness I do not have to do that again for another 50,000 miles.I bought this as an extension for a tire-inflater and car vacuum where both plug into the 12V cigarette light socket.  With this, I can take the inflater and vacuum all around the vehicle with no worries.  I can even stretch it out and manage to use it for those items on another vehicle that's parked beside mine.  So, I'm please with it.
Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.Given as a gift to my son in law and one for myself,this wrench does a great job of getting the filter off with ease.I would recommend it to every one that needs a good filter wrench.
Great set of grab handles. Durable, sleek, and a breeze to install. Also adds a rugged look along with functionality to any Jeeps' Interior. Installed on a 2008 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited using factory hardware. Love them.I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.Yuasa batteries are OEM in most if not all motorcycles. I've found they outlast all other brands I have tried over the years.The fit is perfect and can be verified on the manufacturers website.I would recommend Yuasa batteries for all motorcycle applications.
Need a 90 degree to make life easier on one of my bikes,  one has a 90 degree on the tires already but this fit the bill on my GL1200. only problem I can see is the pin in the center is  plastic so dont know the longevity on it.Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them.

Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellThey work just great for what I want.  I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer.  Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out.I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderEven though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad.Great fit for my 2009 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  I couldn't find any other shades that fit the unique window shape well, and while this item is pricey, it is worth it.  To stow it you do have to roll it up which many cases has caused it to be flattened while in the vehicle, but it held up well.

This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.This gas cap does an admirable job of both containing the fuel within the tank and venting off excess vapor pressure.It is brand new and AC Delco branded. It comes with a tether as shown in the picture. It is a perfect fit.Not much else to say about it.Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.
If you work on dirty/greasy stuff, you need this.Gritty, to get the grunge out of your fingerprints/creases, doesn't smell odd, and it dissolves grease like you would not believe.  One cleaning, and you're likely done, even if your hands could double as pumpkin lube. (automotive reference)Users might have trouble understanding exactly how to use the gauge without the instructions in hand because the design isn't intuitive.  But I do 'really like' this item.Simply taking a pressure reading is easy enough: Power on, hold it in your hand with your thumb on the raised bumps on that little slope above the big round button and press it against the valve until it beeps a couple of seconds later.  The reading is very accurate and the display easy to read in any weather condition.  And once you set your target pressures in the unit you can see how well your reading matches your preferred pressure.  On these points alone, I give it four stars, but not five for the following reasons.- The gauge powers off only a moment after you take a reading, so you have to start it again and select front or rear for each tire.  There should be a way to set how many seconds before it shuts off.- I don't even remember what the biggest button on the gauge does, but both its placement and the way it's marked causes you to naturally think it's the power and reset button.  It's not.  If I have to guess, it's probably "Enter" for when you're setting it up with your target tire pressures--I don't remember.- Bottom button, don't remember.  The bottom line on design here is, too many buttons which aren't intuitive or logically placed.If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.
When your trying to keep small screws from backing out, this is the one.The &#34;Blue&#34; type is still way to strong for small screws, and it will be very difficult to remove them.The &#34;Purple&#34; works great, holds the small screws securely, and allows them to be removed without destroying or bunging them up.This buffer has plenty of power to get the job done, and appears to be well worth the money.  Some minor assembly is required.  There is a `manual' but it does not contain any instructions, instead it mostly covers general safety.  Assembly is fairly simple.  You first attach the curved top handle, either with or without, the straight side handle.  The handle can be installed for either right or left hand operators.  The buffer is top heavy, so installing the side handle is highly recommended.This unit comes with the accessories to get started right away.  For buffing, it has a wool pad, and rubber backing pad.  For sanding, a Velcro backed hard plastic disc is included, but you will need to provide the sandpaper inserts.  A special wrench for locking down the rubber backing pad is included.Controls are pretty basic.  There is a throttle switch on the bottom of the handle, with a lock button to keep the motor running.  The speed control dial is on the top of the housing, and goes from 1 to 6 (maximum).  The buffer starts to whine at around level 3, and gets screaming loud at full speed, when ear protection is definitely recommended.  The amount of vibration will vary according to the task, and motor speed.  When sanding or buffing fine dust is typically produced, so you may want to wear eye protection and a dust mask.If you are into weightlifting, using the buffer on a vehicle may not be too difficult, but for those not so physically fit, managing the weight and vibration, could be a challenge.  Because of the tool is about 18 inches long, your hands end up positioned about a foot apart, in order to keep the torque generated by the buffer under control.  Just a little inattention can result in losing control, or dropping the buffer, and you don't want to hurt yourself, damage your paint job, dent your vehicle, or damage anything else.The supplied wool buffer is quite thick, and does a pretty good job, but you do need to apply pressure for it to work.  For the average sedan, buffing the hood and trunk should be the easiest.  Things get harder when you do the sides, or curved or irregular surfaces, and have to both support the weight of the buffer, and apply pressure to the surface.  Buffing non-flat areas usually requires changing angles, and varying the point of contact, and amount of pressure applied.  Users will need to find the grip and techniques that work best.  Buffing will require some finesse at times, and if your muscles are straining, this is when accidents can happen, or you can hurt yourself.  Doing the roof can be tricky as well.The listed weight of eight pounds, may not sound like a lot, but if you are bracing your body, locking your forearms, and squeezing hard on the handles for an extended period of time, you may find your muscles a bit sore, or in `shock' from the vibration, if you overdo it.  Just go easy when using it for the first few times.The pictured buffer has a blue plastic housing and black handle, but the unit also comes with an orange plastic housing.  It has a ten foot cord with a twin blade plug, and comes with a set of spare brushes.  The buffer does produce very good results, so if you have a strong back, and the upper body strength, it could be a very cool buy.This can be fun stuff to add to your automobile - Intended to get the attention of the driver behind you with hand signals !The unit is heavy and very well built
i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicelyDoes what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommendChange the oil yesterday and the oil filter fit perfectly in our 2003 Z4 3.0.  I'm glad that it comes with an extra o-ring for the oil filter canister and all paper is nice.
The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock "beep-beep" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud.ran this below the carpet to the rear of my jeep. i did not want to run a permanent additional, and having the ability to plug in to my cigarette or power outlet gives me the best of both worlds.Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.
Use this with every tankful on my mower and other small machinery that sits around between uses, and haven't had any ethanol related problems (gumming up.) Excellent for winter storage to if you don't want the hassle of draining the carbs, gas tanks whatever.Put full weight of my fifth wheel them with no problem, but you need two if you have a double axle. Lay them both down in the same direction and pull the trailer completely over the first one and onto the second. Be sue they are spaced the same distance as the wheel axles.Use these in trailer tires, car tires, truck tires, ANY tires-these have saved me several times on the road, pull the nail, install one or 2 of these, reinflate with a small portable (or my nitrogen tank if I'm in the service truck), back on the road.
the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob.fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it.This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked. When disconnected, it also does not leak (it does not pressure out unless you pump it).
I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.
Low price, can get one for each of my 3 vehicles...the stock wrench that came with the cars are too short....when you need it, it will be worth it.There are many other products like the ctech but this is clearly one of the highest quality. The best part is there are optional wires that fit many needs or if you have multiple vehicles.I haven't had a chance to use them in the rain but for normal riding they are very good.  Easy to put on with the two zippers and they seem to have a complete liner that is waterproof.  Comfortable too.  They are not SIDI or BMW quality but for the price are fine.This was added after a 4 hour ride in the rain.  This boot is a rain magnet, I had so much water in these it could be dumped out.  I need to change these to NO STARS as the main point of buying a waterproof boot is to have it be water-proof and these are NOT.  Don't buy these if you want any sort of water resistance or water proofing as they are bad for that.
I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic.  I have not used the pump on the truck, yet, but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions: vacuum and pressure, which are selected with a knob on the side.  The pressure release valve has a large handle, but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure.  The gauge swivels, so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring.  It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.  I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container.This made my brake flush just as easy as an oil change. Fill it up, tighten everything up (really tight, more on that later) pressurize and open caliper bleed nipples one by one.Couple nit-picks:1: Tough to tell when you are running out of fluid in the resivoir. The pressure bottle is a thick plastic that's barely translucent. Nearly pumped air through the entire brake system at the end because I couldn't tell the pressurizer was dry of fresh fluid.2: They really need to ship with a roll of teflon plumbers tape. The connection between the hose and the adapter leaked for me, and I had it tight as could be.Overall a must have for DIY brake jobs. Couple things hold it back from being a 5-star product.Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank.
I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank.  Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon.  But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work.UPDATE:  I was able to actually use this in my generator afterall.  I had to insert the hose at an angle to reach a certain part of the gas tank and it worked like a charm. But, you need to use the up/down motion really really fast to start it off and then it will siphon. I guess it takes a little practice and a little patience. Once you get it right you'll have no problem doing the next time. I keep this in my truck now in case I ever need it.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.This works great with my John Deere rider. With the Deere sitting for a week between mowing, or just over the winter, it didn't always want to immediately start. So about 15 minutes before I plan to mow I put this tender on and it charges up the battery so that it immediately starts. Nice!I also use this for a Jeep and a trailer that don't get driven a lot.
Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.I now have 4 Battery Tenders, this being my 2nd Battery Tender Jr.  I use the larger models for 2 cars I store each winter, and I use the Jr. models for my generator and my lawn tractor.  Easy to use and work great, I've not yet needed to replace a battery after a storage season.I replaced my original filters with these FRAMs in my 2000 Chevy Silverado.  It only took me 11 years to figure out I had them.  So, now that I have declared myself as an Auto Incompetent, I can still say it was easy to replace them and the FRAMs fit perfectly.
I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThe BatteryMinder #12248 is a 2/4/8 amp charger and the best charger i have ever used. It is built to last. Will quickly clean sulphur off the lead plates. Can make a weak to almost dead battery good again. Will increase the voltage even on a newer battery. This is now my favorite charger. Cannot hurt any battery. It just makes any battery much better. Will also maintain a battery better and safer than most other low amp maintenance chargers. No other battery charger compares to this model BatteryMinder, the #12248. I don't know about the other models, but this model does more and it is amazing. It cost more but this charger is probably 10 times better than the rest. I am getting more than my moneys worth, every time i use it. It will pay for itself by restoring an almost dead battery. It will actually make an old battery useable again and for a long long time. Don't bother with any more searching or reviewing of battery chargers. Just get this BatteryMinder model. You have now found the best! I should know, i have a shop. I know other auto shop owners that would rather just sell you a new battery. Most auto repair shops do not use this charger. They just test the battery for draw and voltage. You might easily get a couple more years out of your old battery if you use the BatteryMinder first. Enough said, bye.
Recently replaced all the oil in my front dif/rear diff/ and transfer case on an 07 Tundra. Went from Mobile1 to this, and noticed a slight improvement in noise.I'd use this again.The door catches on a toy hauler will wear out over time, whether from sun damage or excessive use, etc. These are a great thing to have on hand for the times this happens. Easy, two screw install...should fit directly over the existing door catch holes on most RV's.I have used this brand/type thread sealer in many applications from intake bolts, head bolts, and even under the water line on hulls. I`ve never had any issues with removing any hardware using this product! recommend it hands down!
Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!Used part of it on my 2012 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI.  Great design - the twist shut off valve is a very practical feature.  Took off the very tip of the funnel (and put the rest aside) and attached it to a plastic hose that I had attached to a 2-gallon Home Depot pump sprayer.  Tip fit perfectly over the hole in the transmission filter housing and into the plastic hose.  Was able to pump in 6 liters in MUCH less time (and no mess) and use the &#34;snorkel&#34; or standpipe to drain off the excess, after running the DSG through the gears and getting temp up to about 40c.  Pumping in 6 liters dilutes and flushes out the dirty fluid caught up in the fluid cooler, the transmission body and the shifting channels.  Result:  a much better DSG service than the dealer provides.We use K&N filters in our Jet Ski. Having the nut welded on the end really helps removal in the tight confines of the engine compartment.
arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......great tool to have, makes the job much easier. the design is ergonomically right. the price is right also. it is made with quality workmanshipThe jug came with a seal which is intact.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt the quality of a product that is in a sealed container and that is labeled as it was marketed.
You know those expensive "headlight restoration" kits you can get?  Well, you can actually use an abrasive polish (like this one) and achieve much the same result.  I use masking tape around the edges of my headlights, then use an orbital polisher with a firm pad to polish my headlights using this compound.  It's very adept at removing that thin layer of yellowish oxidation which makes headlights more opaque than clear.  Best of all, this bottle has a lot of compound in it and you could polish your headlights probably 75 times on one bottle before running out.So there is that... but it's also good on paint.Over the years I have found the best use of a rubbing compound is to either restore heavily oxidized finishes (with no clearcoat), or to remove paint/scuff deposits on a small area of your car.Be advised that this is a very abrasive compound and you should NOT use this as a general purpose polish for a newer car finish.  Every time you use this product you remove a tiny layer from your car's finish.  Remember that and use with caution.  If someone bumps into your new car in the parking lot and left a paint scuff, this is the ideal product to get it off with.  If you have an old car that's been sitting out in the sun too long and has faded a bit, you can use this product on the entire car to bring it back to its near-original shine by removing that layer of oxidation which makes it look dull.So whether you own a new car or old one, this is a great product to keep in the garage for detailing days.If you have ever tried to pull off automotive trim pieces using metal (such as a screwdriver) then you know the damage it can cause. Plus, a screwdriver or a credit card or some other tool is just not the right tool for the job. I used this kit to pull trim and replace stereos in both my cars today: BMW & Toyota. They came in handy for both. Without this kit, I don't think I could have got the BMW done without screwing something up. Super handy tools to have if you're type of person to mess around with the interior of your vehicle.Our BMW came with run-flat tires and no room for a spare.  Those run flats were noisier, wore out faster, and rode rougher than the non-run flat version of the same tire.  They were also much more expensive.  We swapped to those non-run-flat tires but worried about finding a roofing nail or bad pothole in the road one day and regretting it.Thanks to this kit we no longer have to worry.  I've used slime in other cars before an it outperforms fix-a-flat easily.  Its a little harder to put in than the competitor but you can keep this in your car year-round and you couldn't do that with an aerosol can.This kit can help provide peace of mind for you whether you keep it in your car, your spouse's car, your kid's car, or wherever.
REPLACE WATER PUMP SO I DECIDED TO REPLACE THE BELTS TOO ....PERFECT FIT FOR 5.3L 2002 ESCALDE.....NO SQUEAKING AT ALL IN THE MORNINGS....I'VE HAD THIS PRODUCT BEFORE AND FOUND IT QUITE SATISFACTORY....ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR EASY REMOVING OF BIRD DROPPINGS ON MY BLACK CARS....WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT...THX...IT WORKED
I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .I place these levelers on the front and side of my travel trailer so I don't have to carry around a 4 foot level.  Every camper I tell or whom asks says they are going to now get them.Seems Well Made, You will need a regular Shop extension cord to use this. I use this to power a Macerator to pump out my RV Tanks into a holding tank in my pick up truck bed and then drive to the dump station so I don't have to tow my poop wagon at 2 miles an hour thru the gravel in the campground. I have not actually jumed a vehicle with this , but I did test it on my battery start tester and it performed very well.Good Cables and Clamps, I suspected the accuracy of the gauge but checked it against my Fluke Meter and it is pretty close.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom.  On some vehicles with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless.
I mounted one of these levels on the side and the other on the front of my camper where I can see both at the same time. Makes leveling the fifth wheel a snap. They are held in place by adhesive strips. Just make extra sure that your camper is level when you mount them in place. The only reason that I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is because the green has faded to a yellow in the bright sun, but it still works fine.The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.Both of my older cars had their factory nozzles falling apart thanks to arizona sun. I ordered these, funny they are same help brand sold at the zone, and installed them in 1 minute. They work great, yes you adjust them by just pushing the metal nozzle around, which you can do with factory nozzles as well. I prefer these spray pattern over factory. Factory was just like 2 streams, like a water gun, these are two fans of spray. The factory streams barely covered the window, these cover the whole thing in 2 seconds.
I installed these to replace my stock, yellowish, non-impressive Toyota FJ Cruiser headlamps.  You can see the difference in a pic I posted, the drivers side is the PIAA and the passenger side is the stock lamp.  The PIAA is visually whiter without the blue look.  I have not spent a lot of time with them on dark country roads yet but the initial feeling is that they should be an excellent upgrade.  I will post up once I have a few miles on them in the dead of dark!Update July 2013.  I love these lights and they are still going strong.  Excellent white light for dark, dark country road driving.  FJ should have come with white lights like this from the factory, they are a great match!Update October 2013....they are still working GREAT!While I haven't had my 2013 Rubi in enough trouble to test these things out (I supposed I could use a hammer??), they feel very sturdy once installed. And they don't sit directly on top of the light as there are spacers installed. A common complaint, however, is that they do use the same screw holes. But, to be perfectly honest (this is the Internet...where everyone is honest, right??) I bought these more for their cool appearance than the protection they might offer. There. I said it ;-)These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights.
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLThey fit perfect, they do exactly what they are supposed to do, and I got them for a great price. What beats that?This thing really cleans what you do not expect do get cleaned and even with ease. Try it and you'll know what I'm talking about.
Not a perfect fit using the double stick tape, going to drill and screw a few holes to hold them fully secure.Not bad thought!Solid pin. The keyhole cover slips often. I added 3 rubber o-rings to snug it up to the 2 inch hitch.Fits well into the 7 pin socket and holds the 4 pin socket securely.  Works just like it's supposed to.  Nice adapter
Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.I drive a BMW 530i. I ordered and installed these plugs myself a couple of weeks ago. This will probably be the ONLY spark plug change my car will receive from me as these are 100,000 mile plugs. At 95,000 miles my old plugs were still in decent condition and could have had another 20,000 miles put on them as far as I could tell. My number 1 cylinder plug had a couple of small pits in two of the four prongs. Regular plugs would have burned out long before 95,000 miles.If your car specs support these plugs BUY THEM as they will probably be your last spark plug change for that vehicle.I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine.
Still not the ideal detailing brush I've been looking for, for the bristles don't always stay on the brush as they should, but much better than most brushes for the price range. Of course it's possible to go and find one for $30+ but that's an absurd price. For this price range, this is a pretty good brush to go with.I admit I got this for a good price, delivered fast but it is not the best quality.  Mine has already a leak in the hose.  Just consider what you will get for the price.This is a nice steering wheel cover.  I'm not completely sure its leather but it feels nice.  I read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather.  I'm going to say this.  If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $20 for a product.  For that price you get what you get,  regardless of what the manufacturer may claim. Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant.  A nice cover it is.  Top grain leather it is not, at least not for $20. Want top quality?  Spend multiples of the cost of this product! !!! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap.
The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks
Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute.Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.

Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellI haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!!

Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThese worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.

However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.Use this product to recharge your K&N air filter.  I don't know of any other product I could use to recharge my filter.I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump.

If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.

This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youRepeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckNo headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.
Don't waste your money on Fram filters. Mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of 5k miles.Fit my E39 528i perfectly. It also came with the correct o-ring to seal the oil filter housing. Just buy it already!I love K&N filters.  I use them in all my cars. As soon as I buy a car I replace the filter with a K&N. Just buy a cleaner kit and clean as needed. Never will need replacing. Do not over oil the filter once you clean it and let it dry before reinstalling filter. If you over oil the filter, the oil can get into intake manifold and build up dirt.This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.
Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.

If you ever used a short stubby wrench that came with your car, you would wish for one of these. I have one for each of my cars, and one for the garage. With this wrench the amount of leverage you can get even with one hand/arm is great. Totally worth it for the price. I just suggest people get a torque wrench as I can see people over-tighten some lugs with this thing...that's not a good thing either.Buy it, it will pay for itself the first time you ever have to use itI have a 2007 RAV 4 V6 and change my own oil. This tool fits the cannister perfectly and makes installing a new filter cartridge and "O" rings a snap. You just need a common 3/8" rachet driver to fit the hole. Worth every penny for this well made, accurate, quality product. If you have one of the 65 mm canister type filter housings, and change your own oil, you can't do better than this. Highly recommended.dont buy this product, I  bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing, the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn, waste of money. at least amazon let me return it broken.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Item works as described, saves crooks from sealing your gas. Key works smoothly in cap and with a turn its uockeddoes the job.

Very nice filter media that fit directly into the old fixture that I pulled out from behind the glove box.  It literally took me 2 minutes and saved me $65.  2009 Accord - open the glove box and push forward on the clip on the right hand side of the open glove box, squeeze the glove box on the left and right in an inward direction and the box will drop down to expose the filter behind the glove box...so easy.  Reverse to re-installmeasure your disc and look at the sizing before ordering.  I feel like my bike is secure when I park it. It has an orange cabled lanyard that runs from the lock through the front wheen and stretches to the handlebar and loops over the handle bar weights in the groove making it impossible to forget you have locked up the front wheel. Great buy.I cut the horn off the compressor. The horn will fit under the stock cowbell. The compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with 3 large zip ties. I ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire. The horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h3ll.  Many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good.
We bought and installed extras of these on our RV, just because the manufacturer never seems to put them in convenient places.  I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them.Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup.

Ok so I figured I would write a review since these seem to be new to amazon and they had prime shipping so I went for them.Firstly these are ATO fuses.  The description doesn't say it anywhere for some odd reason however they also sell a mini fuse set which is labeled correctly and the picture shows ATO fuses.  Anyways, the fuses came in a box that is actually pretty nice and latches properly shut.  Label says 1 year warranty although their fuses so shouldn't have a problem.  On the other side of the boxes label is a chart showing Tan = 5amp, Red = 10amp, Blue = 15amp, Yellow = 20amp, Clear = 25amp, Green = 30amp.The fuses themselves seem to be very nice quality and have the number on them printed clearly however it is the plastic color and not painted white.  Note that the link that connects the two ends is horse shoe shaped rather than zigzagged which is something I personally have never seen before.At ~$10 it was a great price for 120 fuses + an actual working container.California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.

I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.Precise sizes since they weren't listed in any description: .045 .080 .050 .040 .060 .044I used to gap 4 NGK Iridium IX spark plugs. The tool's metal didn't bend. Would buy again.
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
This is a factory ScanGauge Cable. I bought it to more easily transfer my ScanGauge from different vehicles so I wouldn't have to take down my already routed cable in my primary vehicle. Great value. Cheapest price I could find online unless you want to make your own cable.My buddy has one and i use it when i have to do an emergency break job on one of my old cars. So now since i have aftermarket rims that require a thin wall socket.... I used it as a excuse to buy this. Its a great little breaker bar to keep around for when you need to change tires.Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RV
This is a great produce for polishing up those special auto rims. The job is made simple with this product and Mothers Mimi Ball is a must.This is a must have for any RV owner.  It is a good size and accurate.  Love this thing!  Very well made.This is a nice set that works as advertised. Perfect for recessed plugs, well built, and should last a long time...
Got this to replace the stock Thermostat on my 99 Jeep XJ. Stock one is 195 degree, but I like my engine to run a little cooler. Worked great.I bought this for my 4-wheeler. I have a K&N filter on my truck and it has performed real well. Just take an air hose and clean it instead of buying another one. I'm hoping to get the same service out of this one too. Every-time I have my 4-wheeler service, they change my air filter. Well.........those little filters are fairly expensive. I figure I can save a little over some time as far as the filter is concerned.........plus K&N has a pretty good reputation. I would recommend this to anyone wanting such an item.I bought this to simply pop the lower ball joint on my 2006 Land Rover LR3 with 70K miles. I couldn't use the venerable pickle fork, so I had to breakdown and buy a front end set. This kit paid for itself in this one job alone. The dealer wanted over $700 for this job; It cost me $200 for parts and $94 for this kit. I used the longest puller for my job and it easily popped off the ball joint with just a couple of cranks with a normal length 1/2 drive breaker bar. The puller didn't even flinch. No warps or bends in the claws.I suspect this kit will serve me for life since I won't be abusing it with a commercial rate of use. I do work on cars more than the average backyard mechanic and I am confident you don't need to drop $400 more on a commercial grade name brand set.
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.2007 F=150 Ford Pickup (Triton V-8).  No tether without you rigging it but it does the job.  Depends on what you want.  I'm happy.Update 02/10/2014Has proven to function tho sometimes finicky on the relock and after use seems somewhat flimsy.  I probably will replace with a metal one somewhere along the line (if available) and am lowering my original rating from five to three stars accordingly.
This is my third K&N; filter that I had purchased. When Amazon had a sale, I immediately bought a third for my 05 Camry. I also have filters for my 2007 Highlander and 1997 Chevy G3500. They all have given me smoother acceleration and a 10% increase in fuel economy. I went from 19-20MPG to 22-23MPG. It's only a couple MPG, but it really adds up in the long run. I wasn't expecting massive gains, because as other reviewers have said, if these filters gave significant increases in MPG, all the Car manufacturers would be installing these as standard or creating their own versions.As for the horsepower increase claim, I would only know if I put the car on a Dyno, so I can't say if there's a difference.Overall, worth the buy if you don't want to keep buying new disposable filters.I ordered these tire irons to change the tires on my Buell Blast, The fact that they include a pouch to keep the Tire irons in is a great addition. I used them to mount my rear tire (Pirelli Diablo) and it really held up to the job. I was think that with the way that I was cranking on these that it would bend, but not so. I would have to agree with other reviews that to have another pack so that I would have 3 Tire irons to use while mounting is a good idea. I know it ups the price a bit, but it's worth it. i did get my tire mounted with just two, but I did notice there was a point where I wouldn't have minded having a 3rd...Great Tire Iron, I would recommend these..This is a must if you own the Hi-Lift jack.  This makes using the jack so much easier in many cicumstances.  I bought it to go along with my 48" Extreme model for my 2011 Polaris Ranger Crew and unfortunately 9I guess fortunately) I have not had the opportinuty to use this attachment on my own rig but have already had the chance to use it to help others!  I love it!
I put this fluid in my 2004 Hyundai Tiburon against the recommendation of AAMCO transmission service.  I was looking at servicing my transmission and asked if they would flush this fluid into my system.  The guy I talked to tried to tell me that this was a "trick" fluid and that my car would shift very hard and it was not recommended for my car.I went against his word based on the reviews of amazon, recommendations by royal purple, and my own intuition based on product specifications.  After changing my fluid to Royal Purple I can say that this has made a phenomenal difference in my car's shifting.  My car was not as smooth as it is now when I bought it new 95,000 miles ago.  I without a doubt would put it in my car again and will be changing in another 4 quarters in the next 30,000 miles.  My car has always been a little choppy shifting since it is only a 4 speed, but with royal purple I can't even feel it shift.  To think that AAMCO told me it would make my car shift hard infuriates me.I highly recommend this fluid for your vehicle if it meets specifications.Update:For anyone wondering, my transmission is still functioning perfectly fine.  I haven't seen any decrease in shifting since March.  Everything is just as good as when I wrote the review. I took a peak at my fluid a few days ago and it still looks and smells perfect.  I still highly recommend it.Update #2:Still rolling around with this fluid in.  It's been over a year and a half and I drive a lot. The older my car gets the harder I am on it which is exactly what I shouldn't be doing, but it's not a baby anymore.  Still 0 problems even when dropping from 7k rpm. I'm confident my car is going to last forever with RP.I purchased the JNC300XL for my wife, because she has a habit of leaving some load "on" and drain her battery.  I was attracted to this product because, (1) it was ranked well on amazon, (2) it does have lots a solid reviews, and (3) it was small and not too heavy for my wife.  Before purchasing this product, I was spectacle of the "900 Peak Amp" rating.  I researched all of the internet to try to find any battery specs that comes inside this so-called jump starter.  When it arrived I tried it on a friends sedan.  Connected it up, turned over the car, and nothing.  I took the JNC300XL back home and opened it up to check the battery.  It is an 8ah battery inside. To be frank, I am not a battery expert, but how can a 8ah battery delivery 800 peak amps? I reassembled the JNC300XL and connected it back up it my friends car, and left it connected for several hours (~2-3 hours), and it did eventually work. If you are purchasing this as a jumper starter for emergency situations, I think you will be disappointed.  If you just need something to boost your battery, and time is not an issue, it works just fine.  I just think the product description is misleading.  It should say battery booster, not jump starter.Brought this for my old man's Honda odyssey 1998. I was going to purchase him the  Honda OEM filter but he prefer Fram only.Since its cheaper and works just as well. Any oil filter is good enough remember its made of paper it gets the job done. I installed it and it worked great on his old engine. Now just to wait for the next oil change (3,000 miles or 6 months) to purchase another one!
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY&#8230; Way&#8230; Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.Great stuff every one should have some laying around!I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderSure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.
Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.Nice little horn for my Harley. LOUD enough to get people to move when they pull out in front of you and decide to go slow, small enough to fit, and nice to look at.Got asked asked a bike meet just the other day "what is that" and he sure got a surprise when I pushed the button lol. This model is completely chrome to look at when installed,  unlike other types that a partially chromed.To use this on a motorcycle you will need to install the included relay for the main power to the horn to prevent damage to your wiring. If I needed to I would definitely buy this horn again, in the first week it has already scared two cagers out of my way that have cut me off by running red lights, who knows it may have even saved my life.I am glad I bought it, but unfortunately due to Amazon raising prices as I put items in my cart it will probably be my last purchase from them. I mean really, I put a $225 item in my cart but when I go to pay for it it goes UP $75? That is just insane.Got one of these mounted in my vehicle. Seems to have a quality build and a ok mount. Makes install a little easier, just remember that you'll have to get to this ASAP is something does happen so mount it somewhere you'll be able to get to even if you're upside down. ( Hopefully never ) This is just another one of those "just incase" tools that you carry and hope you never need. But better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it.
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.I must have misunderstood how this siphon works. I have never been able to get it work at all. I have tried every possible method  and no luck. I understand how gravity works but apparently this device doesn't. If you get it to work, more power to you.I think it will do just what I want. I got it for power outages and it powers my TV just fine.
This fits perfectly onto my Scion 2006 XB. Cheap. Just did an oil and filter change. I would buy this again and reccomend this item.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.I have this on my 27ft TT.  It fits the latch nice and secure.  I would reccomend this to anyone needed a little protection.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This fits perfectly onto my Scion 2006 XB. Cheap. Just did an oil and filter change. I would buy this again and reccomend this item.
These are a great set of handles.  They fit into existing bolt locations on the speaker bar in my 2011 2-door Wrangler, and are extremely sturdy.  They match the black interior perfectly, and the grip itself is a solid, strong rubber.  The mounting position is perfect for riders in the back seat. I bought these alongside theRugged Ridge 13505.04 Grab Handles, which I also recommend for the front seats.This is the OEM filter and cap with the gasket. They're the Genuine OEM items.Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.Fits perfectly, easy to install.  Anyone - including those with zero mechanical ability, can change this filter easily.  Anyone who would pay the massive amount the Audi dealer wants to change this filter is a complete fool.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckI use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.
The brush is fantastic!  I wake up every morning to tree dust and the brush knocks it off in under 30 seconds.  I just ordered the dash duster from California hoping for the same kind of result inside.  No streaking or pushing the dust around, it just cleans .The storage pouch was a nice plus.This is a GREAT product (what isn't from Mothers honestly??) to buff up and polish plastics.  I used this for my upper third brake light for my ranger and it took the dull hazy out of it and made it nice and shiny.  Used it also on the plastic on the gauge cluster and it made it nice as well.I would NOT use this to polish the headlights... get a kit that is DESIGNED for headlight restores, that is a multistep process...etc.  This has minor abrasives but once buffed out leaves the plastic with a nice smooth almost deep finish to it.  I'm sure it has oils to put back into the pores of the plastic.Overall a solid product to bring back some life in dull and worn looking plastic pieces.  Plus it doesn't break the bank...Thanks,-NigeMy Nissan Quest required a 28" and an 18". It wasn't until after I had them on for a while that I noticed the 28" does not cleanly touch the glass surface in the center of the spread, the point where the blade attaches to the wiper arm. This leaves a wet 2" channel arc right in my line of sight. I thoroughly examined the blade and the attachment, making sure it was attached as intended. It was. My guess is that the pressure that keeps the outer edges of the blade firmly on the glass is so strong it lifts the center up. The 18" appears to be ok. I wish I still had the box to send it back. Now I need another new blade.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI haven't put this cover through difficult duty, and probably won't...it will stay in the carport most of the time. However, construction is good, the small vents on either side are pretty nice.Regarding fitment, the XL fits a BMW F800ST (with stock rear luggage rack) perfectly. This bike is about 90&#34; long, maybe a few inches longer with the rack.I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
II have had these on my 2003 Tahoe for over 1yr & they work great.will put them on my 1986 cutlass when they need to be changed.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.I use this to connect my wind turbine to my battery bank.It works well,hasn't cracked,and the connectors are solid.It will last me for years to come.
The ANCO Contour is a decent curved blade providing an effective sweep. The "UB" part is the one that works with the flat cane-shaped connector, as opposed to the "OE" blades that comes with three adapter clips which appear to fit rectangular original equipment brackets on some vehicles. The compatibility list has been updated more accurately, but it is best to check before placing your order.Though not the most aesthetically handsome clip to look at, the "Kwik Connect" contour blade is easy to install and costs about as much as any other full blade assembly. I like it.Overall the kit is pretty decent. The case is nice and touch and all of the leads and attachments work well. Will detail them out next. The main issue I have is that the kit is not exactly as shown/advertised.Carrying Bag:The included bag is a very nice heavy duty bag. It&#8217;s a tri-fold bag with 3 pouches sealed with very nice heavy duty Velcro. There is some extra room in at least 2 of the pouches to store additional wires while still being able to close the bag properly.Main Lead wires:The main leads are nice, each end includes a nice cap to keep them clean and free of debris. The lead wires are 18AWG and overall are very nice. They fit into my DMM perfectly and the attachments clip on easily as well except the alligator clips (details below)Test Probes:The test probes are nice, but larger than I expected from the product images. They double as banana clips which is a nice addition. They have plastic covers, that while on cover up the banana clip part leaving only the test probe tip exposed. Again this is nice to keep things well insulated when needed. The major issue I had was that the probes alone are much thicker than I had expected from the images and with the covers on they are even thicker. This doesn&#8217;t make them bad, just slightly misrepresented and not the best for smaller electronics work.Mini Hooks:The mini hook attachments are very nice they have a perfectly tensioned spring for smaller electronics work. The hook pops out easy and the tension from the spring is tight enough to keep it well attached but not too much as to bend wires. Overall these are very good attachments and work well with smaller electronicsAlligator clips:These are where my major complaint is, and the largest reason for the lower rating. The clips I received are nothing like what is in the product images. Please view the customer added image gallery sections full a full library of all of the products in this set. In that gallery you will see that the alligator clips included are very heavy duty. They are nice clips, but not what was shown to come with this set. They are hard to attach to the lead wires and are too large and strong to work with many smaller electronics products. If you try and remove the insulator boot you find that the clips are nice but the end is completely bare. This was a disappointment. Again please see the customer image gallery for detailsConclusions:Overall this is a good kit, and contains some good parts for small electronics but the test probes are larger that depicted and the alligator clips are miles away from what was expected to be with this kit. I would like to give this product a 4 or 5 start rating, as the products are not &#8220;bad&#8221; they are just not what was represented in the pictures and product info. This is a kit meant for larger electrician or automotive electrical work maybe. This kit is not the best for small electrics hobbyists. That said, the price may be low enough to be worth he bag and the couple parts that are good for the small electronics work.Please review the image gallery and determine if they will be worth the money.**If this review was helpful please click the button below**This is a great replacement bolt kit for your License plate mounts.  I personally did not need the grommets but the bolts were exactly what i needed.  Only negative is that the key for the bolts should have been grooved on both ends, as the groove is only on the tip of the long end leaving you to struggle with the short end of the key when the bolt gets really tight.  Advise using something like a Ratchet extender on it....
Great accessory for when you get stuck and need to lift just one wheel to perform a self recovery to get back on the trail/street.Have you ever felt like your auto mechanic was "Mr. Wizard"?  All the way down to the bad attitude?  Only to find he has a doo-dad sitting somewhere out of eyesight that tells all, like a crystal ball...Well for a reasonable price you can get your own crystal ball.  It might be able to predict the future and track flying monkeys but it can tell you very quickly why the "Check Engine" light has come on.  Big or small you know what might be waiting for you when you go see Mr. Wizard.  Sometimes you might even be able to track down the problem yourself and cut the cost to fix it.I would not go to Oz without mine!Got one of these mounted in my vehicle. Seems to have a quality build and a ok mount. Makes install a little easier, just remember that you'll have to get to this ASAP is something does happen so mount it somewhere you'll be able to get to even if you're upside down. ( Hopefully never ) This is just another one of those "just incase" tools that you carry and hope you never need. But better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it.
this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going.Best choice for the price point research shows penzoil outperforms Mobil 1 in wear test, number one is amsoil but royal purple is a close second and for the money it is number one. Mobil 1 just has excellent marketing it truly is JUNK, but keep buying it if you buy into the marketing lie ; ) .I purchased two cases to handle oil service for an older Boxster; for this purpose there is no cheaper way to get an approved lubricant.When used instead of a 5W30 oil in two 2002/2003 VWs, in moderately cool but not cold temps, noticed easier starting and generally fine performance.At the Amazon price, especially with prime, there is no more affordable way to get this quality of oil.Two alternatives to consider for Porsches:If you are racing a street car, or observing much reduced change intervals, consider Joe Gibbs DT40 or similar, though it does cost even more than this Mobil 1 choice.Another approved and worthy choice for Porsches and other European performance cars is Motul 8100 x-cess 5W40, and this is also sometimes available via Amazon as well as in 5 liter package.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Working well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.
I appreciate that it comes with a full array of battery-ends (4 each of alligator clips and screw-attached).  The simple lights means I can &#34;read&#34; it from across the room...Only 4 stars, though, because it's *not possible* to get 4 cars close enough to this thing to use it as is.  Either you need to pull the batteries out (annoying) or buy a pile of the 25' extension cables (what I did) to reach over to the cars.I'd think, at this price, throwing in at least a couple extension cords would not be unreasonable (heck, even increase the price to include them...who wouldn't use them?)Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage, from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges. I need to buy another pack though, for the back doors protection too, as it is not long enough for both doors. We don't need it for the back doors very often, but I think it will come in handy at times. Since we like this so much, we will be buying another.Can't comment much on these since they have not yet been used (I will come back and update my review is I find any issues after first use) ... but they are built solid, nice tough big hard clamps and love having a long cable so I never have to move cars around or anything if needed. I bought these to have in my new truck since you always need cables ... but another reason is for when I tow my travel trailer and we run the batteries with no shore power they may die after a couple days ... if you are in need a quick small recharge they are the perfect length to pop my hood, run the cables to the back of the truck and hook up to the batteries that are on the tongue of my travel trailer ... running the truck for 30-45 minutes with this nice large gauge wire connected from my battery tot he trailer battery will give me a bit of a charge if ever in a pinch and I have no shore power, solar, or generator to recharge.Bought the bucket boss 06009 jumper cable bag and it fit this 25 footer Perfectly!!!It has no use and is a waste of money right now ... but will EASILY pay for itself the first time you need it ... always be prepared! :)
I installed this as an addition to a Python 991 system.  The sensor was simple to install and the color-coded wires and instructions were clear.  For the price, this is a lot of additional protection for the money.The Camco plumbing vent replacement is perfect for replacing the original vent covers.  It is inexpensive, comes with sealant to apply on installation and I would strong recommend this brand!This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation. Great valuie.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderCan't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous.
This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation. Great valuie.arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......OTC is reliable, and this is also reliable.  The parts are durable and machined well.  If you wok on front ends, you need this kit.  The case is also durable.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!This fit my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee V6. Price was great when I purchased. Can't beat having car parts shipped to your door for free.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.What more can I say other than they work very well..... They beat having to remove seats and so forth to put clamps on the battery! ;-)Tight fit that is snug. A bottom fist strike seats cap. We will see soon how it handles a road trip.
It's okay for OBD stuff and gives some more codes on some models but it is not a replacement for a proper PC based code reader with full model specific software.If I would have done this again I would have bought a cheap net book.This fuel pressure gauge is a good buy for the price, comes with numerous adapters for a well rounded application for most vehicles. my only complaint is the gauge seems quite cheap but that being said i have not had one problem with the set at all and its helped me more then once so i would definitely recommend this for a home hobbyist or a professional tech looking for an affordable fuel pressure set. also comes with a nice bag case type thing for storage.I normally buy FRAM filter from Walmart.  However, many in the Acura forum have good things to say about this filter.  I purchased one for the Acura I just purchased.  Filter looks like it is well built.  The external surface allows for secure grip.  I'll update this review on my next oil change...
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderAmazon's website says the 15" version of this wiper will fit on a 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  That is not really true.  This wiper was "backwards" what my Cayenne required and I had to spend 15 minutes reversing the rubber to get it to fit the Cayenne.If you have a Porsche Cayenne, try something else.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckThey do work. Exactly as advertised.

bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.

Used it to glue a replacement end to the Plexiglas fitting on a brand new paper towel dispenser-- over 10 years ago. Glued a handle back to a blender-- over ten years ago as well. Successfully glued soles back onto my shoes.  Goop is formidable.I used this on a 1993 Lexus with 135,000 miles.It had problems shifting into over drive with a 4 speed auto transmission.In less than 100 miles after replacing 3 qt`s transmission fluid and 8 oz`s Lubeguard (1 oz.for every qt your transmission holds) it shifts smoothly once again.Sounded better than the OEM horn on my bike, but it only worked for a little over a year, then croaked.
I'm very happy with my purchase. After seeing a lot of negative reviews due to seal problems I hesitated to buy this. The reason I did buy it was because someone found a fix for the issue. Turns out the fix is not needed. I guess the manufacturer replaced the gasket because I have no problems whatsoever with air leaks. This device creates a perfect seal. Buy this! This is an awesome gauge with dead on accuracy. I highly recommend this to anyone in the market looking for a gauge. I mean come one it's only 10 bucks!Very easy to use and I have not had any issues with sealing properly. I only wish that you could program 2 vehicles to it. I highly recommend it and will be buying a couple for gifts.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.
haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump.This dropped in without a problem, I am disappointed it did not come with a screw which it should.  I had to replace my distributor five years ago and it was time for a new rotor and distributor cap.  For $8.00 a bosch product is a good buy.  The original Honda rotor was $32.00I have a GMC pickup and a Suzuki wagon. The Suzuki had a gas gauge that registered all over the place. The situation was driving me crazy. I was just about to take her in for gauge repair. I learned about the product from a fellow Suzuki owner. They had the same problem. I used the additive in two tanks of gas and behold the gauge works again. That and the fact the common rail injected 2 liter motor runs much smoother now and has a noticable power increase has made me smile. As far as better gas milage, maybe a little but not significant, but, a one mile per gallon or a two mile per gallon increase is welcome when gas is at $4 dollars a gallon. My GMC pickup has not shown any increase in miles per gallon. The additive has smoothed out that Vortec motor well. I am a regular now. When the vehicles get an oil change at 7000 miles I run a bottle of additive through them.
I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I bought this to go with my Porter-cable 150psi, 6 Gal. compressor. Although the compressor comes with a tire inflation device, I like this one for the built-in gauge, the extension hose and the quality construction.Tried it on my 2007 Aveo with no known problems. It detected zero codes. Hooked it up to my 2000 Sienna with a check light and it prompted a code(PO0135) to replace my oxygen sensor. Did that and rechecked it with no codes. You need a code reader instead of replacing every sensor! How do you erase the codes with the erase button? I tried with the erase button with no avail. I ended up just disconnecting the negative battery cable for five minutes. I replaced the battery cable and started the van up. Low and behold, No More Check Engine Light. This small entry level, pocket size code reader did the job. The OB-2 hook up for the van is under the dash near the steering wheel. Paid for itself with one code reading compared to having the shop do it. I'm glad that I bought this in the comfort of my home with Amazon instead of driving around in traffic.
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.Installed easily and is working fine so far. The kit came with a rubber O ring type gasket which my old cap did not have. Takes a bit of doing to get this gasket positioned to stay in place for an air tight fit but I managed it. The cap could definitely be installed without it but thought I'd give it a try since it was included. I could swear I'm hearing less noise out of my engine with the gasket installed. In any case, all is well that fits well. :-)Installed on a '99 Honda Civic LX, 4 door sedan.haven't used mine yet.

Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor.
I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Great fit for my 2009 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  I couldn't find any other shades that fit the unique window shape well, and while this item is pricey, it is worth it.  To stow it you do have to roll it up which many cases has caused it to be flattened while in the vehicle, but it held up well.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.

Can't ask for more.  I like the charging system.  Just use an extension cord - no little adapter to loose. No frills and does the job.  Will give five stars if it lasts.
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.
Good to have for any fluid changes on my jeep or wifes car.  Can put practically anything in it.  I like it alotit does take a little skill to make sure you dont let it land on any other surface (besides the one your trying to remove 3m from) but honestly it works great. i would recommend this glue remover to anyone who wants to remove decals from there car or remove the glue left over when removed.ran this below the carpet to the rear of my jeep. i did not want to run a permanent additional, and having the ability to plug in to my cigarette or power outlet gives me the best of both worlds.
I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them.I bought these to keep from having to remove the ugly yellow smiley face ones before turning on my daylighters. They fit my 6&#34; daylighters perfectly and clip on solidly.All KC products are high quality, could not believe they give a 23 year warranty on their line of lights!I bought a pair of these and now my hood does not fall on my head anymore. easy to install.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.These bulbs work as described. The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues. They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs, but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness.Typical KC kit.  Easy instructions, miles of wire for any application, beautiful finish on the lights.  They are bright and look good!  Worth the $$$

Now this filter is about 3 times the price of a cheap paper one, but they really do last 100,000 miles before they need to be cleaned. Do they improve mileage? I think they do, but they also improve performance slightly, so unless you have a light right foot you probably wont see much of a difference. When I do notice the gas savings is on the long freeway runs.One thing, when fitting it be careful, the old paper filters will fit in either way around, but the K&N; has 2 nubs on it that make it directional. If you put it in the wrong way around the lid just won't get close enough to close the clips, but rotate it so the nubs are facing the front of the car and the lid will fit perfectly.i bought these for my rv trailer. They are too flimsy and thin for the weight ofmy trailer and the do not fit well under the tires. the lip is guess you would call it is too thing to fit snug in place. there is no string to help you remove or pull them away when packing up. i am buying a different set.

These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.

Changed plugs in 2002 & 2003 Honda CRVs: $88. Shop price to replace plugs: $370 for both vehicles. Time: 20 minutes, and I worked slowly.

It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).
arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.
Ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was 3" diameter but it did not fit, it was just sitting on top loosely.  So I'm giving it 3 stars, if it fits your application, I'd imagine it would be rated highly.  So it's back to either a puck or wood for me.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.Purchased to replace a Toyota 00' Corolla fuel cap, haven't had any issues, fits just the same, only negative might be that it feels obviously cheaper made but it's a fraction of the cost than from the dealer.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.

For my GAS engines I either purchase Bosch Premium (Black) or Purolator PLs (Yellow).  I've read that they are the same filter now.  Don't know.  What I do know is that they are both quality filters for less than $6 from Amazon.  I change them when indicated either by the manual or the driver info readout on the dash.  Never a problem.The Purolators do have the nice little texture grip, but hardly a deal breaker / maker.  These things fit and if you do a web search on filter testing, they are both consistently at the top of the ranks.These are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.Microfiber so far is microfiber, they all seem to clean about the same, some leave behind a little less lent than others but for the price these aren't bad.  Now that being said these are smallest microfiber wash-cloths I have ever seen.  Seriously they are the same size as most washcloths, they are tiny! The package makes them seem bigger than they are.

I have one of these in each of my vehicles, either in the door pocket, center console or glove box.  I didn't mount them because having them loose in a covered compartment seemed a better idea.  I also have the key chain versions (ResQme)as a back-up in case the trapped person cannot reach the one in the door, etc.I have only had to use this device once when a Blazer flipped over on the Interstate in front of me.  The first person on the scene tried several times to break the rear window with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful.  My life-hammer did the job effortlessly with the first swing, and the seat-belt cutter quickly ripped through the belt to release the trapped driver!These should seriously be standard equipment in ALL vehicles!A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom.I mounted one of these levels on the side and the other on the front of my camper where I can see both at the same time. Makes leveling the fifth wheel a snap. They are held in place by adhesive strips. Just make extra sure that your camper is level when you mount them in place. The only reason that I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is because the green has faded to a yellow in the bright sun, but it still works fine.
This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......
Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size.The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.

I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckI use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.
These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.
Replaced my Suburban Anode with this one. Fits correctly and is a good replacement at a cheaper cost. Why pay more.Update: I've used this for the season. It been working great.I ordered this replacement bolt/washer combo for when I changed the oil on a 93 toyota pickup that had been sitting up for a long time.  This combo was a direct replacement and looks like good quality.Great, versatile oil filter.  I have a Passat and couldnt find a wrench to fit it easily. Bought this and it works great.

Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderCareful you don't drop the adapters when prying the package open (don't ask).  Product seems to fit well but time will tell.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youThis fits perfectly onto my Scion 2006 XB. Cheap. Just did an oil and filter change. I would buy this again and reccomend this item.

It will last much longer, and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car.  The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining. It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it isn't anywhere near as bright as a flare. It has a single LED that is very directional. If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P. Logue, 2010
This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youWorks as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander

It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter.

Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter.Change the oil yesterday and the oil filter fit perfectly in our 2003 Z4 3.0.  I'm glad that it comes with an extra o-ring for the oil filter canister and all paper is nice.Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommend
bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower.This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck.
I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror.I purchased 2 packages of these coil compressors (so 4 compressors total) a while back knowing i would need them to swap out a set of springs from 1998 Chev Camaro.  I was installing shocks and lowering coils to improve handling and get rid of some body roll.  On the Camaro, the rear is a solid axle so the coils and shocks install separately (its not a coil over shock system as in the front).  While compressing the rear spring, I ran out of room...the threaded bar portion was making contact with the top of the coil's housing so i used the extra 2 compressors i had to compress the coil further until i could remove it...So the compressors did their job easily. its a good product and very well made however, you may need 3-4 of these compressors to help further compress the coils.on the front, the coils and shocks were out of the car so no space issues and two compressors easily compressed the coil...i used 3 to be safe.I purchased two of these for my kids' key chains as a "back-up" (and will probably purchase a couple more).  When they arrived, I tested them on glass cola bottles, and both functioned repeatedly as they were designed to do... bottles were shattered.  These should function repeatedly until the spring wears out, so TEST THEM when you receive them, and if they fail to function... demand a replacement!Like I said, I purchased these as back-ups, not as a primary device.  Each of our vehicles have an "original hammer" either in the door pocket, center-console, or glove box (mounting them to the dash or door with the included mount is the preferred method, but why mount them when the door pocket or center console have hinged covers that will keep it from "wandering off").  If someone is trapped and cannot reach these locations, the keychain version will be a second-best option, and will always be within easy reach of the driver or passenger!You can't beat the functionality of the original hammer... NO MOVING PARTS.  I have had to use one of the original hammers to break though the rear window of a Blazer that flipped over on the Interstate in front of me several years ago.  The first guy on the scene couldn't break the glass after several attempts with a crow-bar, but my hammer shattered the glass on the first try!  The hammer worked flawlessly, and with little effort.
I bought this to use with my camping trailer. I also use stabilizing jacks and wheel chocks, so the wheel dock really has no use. Seems like it would work well with a boat trailer. Price is good.I purchased this for my 2005 Avalanche to use while I am towing my 28 foot camper.  Prior to having these all I could see behind me was my camper, now I can see any car that is behind me, it's a must have for anyone pulling a trailer that is difficult to see behind and is much better and more stock looking than the other mirror options out there.Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails.
My husband installed these on his 97 Cherokee in just 10 minutes.  Remove 2 bolts on top of each lift support and place a screwdriver under the spring clip on bottom and the ball joint connection on the lower end slips right on.Trunk now stays up and doesn't hit him in his head! Worth the time and money for sure.Be sure to support the trunk with a 2x4 or long broom handle before removing old lifts. Save the bolts because there are no bolts provided with the new lifts.our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back.Our Battery Tender Plus is on a shelf in the garage, and the RV with its battery is parked outside.  This cable runs from the charger to the wall of the garage, down to and thru a vent hole in the wall, then across the driveway, under the RV, then up front to the battery box.  It turned out to be just long enough.  When we leave on a trip, I turn off the charger, then coil the cable beside the garage till we return.  We no longer worry about fast-charging the battery every month or so during the winter to keep it from freezing.
Solidly built. Doesn't destroy the grease cup.  Adjusts to two heights.  Presses out the pin without damaging the threads (as long as the nut is only backed off so the top of the nut is the same level as the top of the threads) and is built to last. Works on the ball joints and tie rod ends. Mechanic quoted me $350 to replace tie rod ends and tie rod inners on 03 diamante.  That is a very good price for parts and labor.  Through Amazon I bought this tool and the $20 smooth inner tie rod remover (looks like a muffler clamp with a 3/8 inch square insert)  Two moog tie rods for $30 each and two ends for $20 each . (parts could have been cheaper but I like Moog)  With this tool and the inner tool the job took only 1 hour for both.  So I saved $200 and still have the tools.  Not bad.  What more can you ask for.  Next project is replacing the 9 ball joints on my 65 FJ40.Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.  I typically prefer to go up a size on wipers since it gives a larger clean area.  You can typically go up 2 inches which translates to one inch per side from where the blade attached to the arm.  When the car is dirty, you should be able to see where that extra inch goes - if it hits the top of the trim or other part, you're out of luckWe're using a 28" blade on the drivers side of my wife's Mazda5, and this clears very nicely - no skips or squeaking.  Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier.My 1999 Lexus RX300 was getting CEL (P0125, P1030, P1033 & P1035).  Read the postings on ClubLexus and found Denso 234-9009 is perfect fit for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (behind firewall, access from underneath the vehicle).  Removing the connector is the biggest job.  Used a pickup tool with wire prongs to hold the sensor connector part from the top, pressed the tab on the right connector and disconnected relatively easily.  Jacked up the front passenger side, went underneath the vehicle and sprayed PB blaster penetrating oil on the old sensor threads, waited for a few minutes and was able to get it out easily using an O2 sensor removal tool.  Applied the anti-seize that came with the package on the new sensor threads and installed.  Total time spent was under 30 minutes!  Disconnected the battery negative terminal for a few minutes, then started the engine and the codes didn't come back!  Check out the pictures posted in the images section.This sensor works for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (before catalytic converter, access from underneath the vehicle) and Bank 2 Sensor 1 (between the engine and radiator, accessed from the top).Note: Recommend using two jack stands for added safety while working under the vehicle.PB Blaster:Blaster 16-PB Penetrating Catalyst - 11 oz.O2 Sensor Tool:Powerbuilt 648691 Oxygen Sensor Offset PullerUpdate: February 16, 2014The Check Engine Light (CEL) is staying off and the mileage has improved.  My vehicle registration is coming up and it is due for SMOG check.  I'll update the review with the results of the test.
Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.I purchased 1 of these to tow my 16 ft camper from Northern New England to Florida this past Spring. You can buy 2 of them and use them for extra protection. I didn't need to do more than 1 as my camper is about 1600 lbs...It took me some driving and stopping to ask others why I didn't feel my sway bar was working to understand I was using it wrong.I had the sway bar to tight. The handle is very easy to turn and you can feel when it gets taunt. Over tightening it will defeat the purpose of using this item. It is NOT a stabilizer bar..it's a sway bar.. took me a while to get it...I prefer to have the sway bar for my small camper..plus it's easy to remove or even loosen..which you really have to do to turn around in tight spaces. The thing will screech as you turn! The sway bar is sup to allow your camper to do some sway just not very much sway. if you over tighten it, it will not work properly..when the wind hits you, both the camper and the car will feel the pull back and forth.. you don't want that.. you want the camper to be able to have some sway with the wind. This product is great because you can adjust the amount of tension for low winds/high winds. GREAT PRODUCT!I use this battery tender for my Harley Davidson. With the OEM security system, the Harley can drain a battery quickly, making it a hard start on those cool fall mornings. When we are up north at our lake home, the HD does not have a garage to be placed in, so I will use this  battery tender outside and did not trust using the normal battery tender out side with not protection, so I was using a pail to place over the tender. Now I can use this one without worry.Would purchase again.
This item is great if you have multiple adapters and need to use the cigarette for charging items for those in the back seat. I have two ports and the extension is used for one of them.I put one of these in each car for emergencies.  This is a great addition to your emergency kit (you know, the one with jumper cables, ponchos, flashlights, etc. that you should keep in your car).I bought some really bad fuse holders that had some horrible fuses included. I had to replace the fuses with the ones from this ATD. These fuses are great quality and they include all the common fuse sizes which is great. This is a sweet buy when you consider your local auto parts store asks $3-$5 for just a pack of 3 fuses in one size. You get alot of fuses in the most common amperage's. Please note these are just one size fuse, There is still one size larger blade fuse and two smaller sizes. Check what you have before ordering. Personally I got them for my fuse-able links I'm adding for all the accessories I have added to my vehicle. When you do any accessory installs in your vehicle I recommend fusing at the point you tapped power from. Better safe than sorry.
STOP! Got this to take out the front side oxygen sensors on my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71. It does NOT fit, no way, no how! Get a 7/8" combo wrench or one of those fancy pants combo wrenches with the split socket at one end! My sensors weren't even that tight!Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.I needed to haul a Honda Pacific Coast which has tons of plastic and no good place to tie straps on without removing some of the bodywork.  The Canyon Dancer II 32 inch model worked great for me and no need to remove any plastic.  No damage and the bike sat on the trailer very securely.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Used with the battery tender plus and with this I can keep the charger at the trunk end of my car with this cable run from the hood underneath it to the back.  Very handy and works great.
This item is great if you have multiple adapters and need to use the cigarette for charging items for those in the back seat. I have two ports and the extension is used for one of them.Fits for my Honda 2005 Lx.Comes with instruction that have pictures.I have to write more to finish this review.I've been using this product for years. It works.1800 degree rating, it can be used on exhaust manifolds (think - exhaust gas temp probe on your diesel), and any bolt that is in a high-temp environment. If you don't need that high-temp rating, there are cheaper products from Permatex that work for that.A little goes a long way, for the average garage-guy this jar will last for years.
HAVE A LINC NAV AND THOUGH IT IS NOT TH BEST FIT IT WORKS, LETS I A BIT A SHINE BUT NOT MUCH, WISH THEY MADE TO HAVE A BETTER FIT FOR DIFFRENT AUTOS BUT THAN THAT WOULD NOT BEFEASABLE FOR THEM ITS GOODBOUGHT THIS FOR A REPLACEMENT TO THE OLD WHITE TANK COVER ON MY 31' COUGAR CAMPER. GREAT COLOR BUT NOT BRONZE, MORE OF A MEDIUM BROWN. I LIKE THE ACCESS ON TOP FOR THE VALVES. THE ONLY REASON FOR 4 STARS IS THE FACT THAT IT IS A 2 PIECE BOLT TOGETHER DESIGN. WOULD HAVE RATHER IT BEEN ALL 1 MOLDED PIECE FOR FIT AND FINISH.I READ ALL THE POS FEEDBACK ON THIS PRODUCT AND HAD TO TRY SOME..THIS STUFF DOES WORK WELL..I HAVE A 1996 FORD RANGER WITH A ROUGH IDLE..POURED SOME IN THE TANK..WITHIN A DAY OR 2..THE IDLE SMOOTHENED OUT..GOT TO USE IT EVERY NOW AND THEN TO KEEP THEM INJECTORS CLEAN..BETTER THAN ANY FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER I EVER USED..IT WORKS GUYS
The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have.I used this along with Dupli-Color metalcast but unfortunately that product worked so poorly that I could not judge if this ground coat work well or not. So if you plan to use this on a chrome finish with Metalcast paint... DONT!This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far.
i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.I ordered this for my sons 07 Tail Boss 330, checked K&N site for proper fitting before ordering it on Amazon. the units dose fit inside filter box but needed to modify inlet pipe or I guess I could of just left it off all together, ether way my a improvement it the bike and I have always trusted K&N to provide better filtering and performance gains.dont buy this product, I  bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing, the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn, waste of money. at least amazon let me return it broken.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.This fits perfectly onto my Scion 2006 XB. Cheap. Just did an oil and filter change. I would buy this again and reccomend this item.Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well, no issues. Would purchase again.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
This was a good fit for my 2004 Toyota Sienna XLE.  One thing to note is that the filter is not marked as to the orientation it should go inside the air cleaner assembly.  The side of the rubber gasket that has the groove on it goes down and the long edge with the notches in the groove go towards the front of the vehicle.  You can't get the cover back on with it incorrectly assembled but it would be nice for them to print on it the orientation.  Good quality though.  Visit my blog at johnfixesstuff.blogspot.com and search for air filter to get instructions with detailed pictures on how to install this filter on your Sienna.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.Its simple and easy to install and setup.  It doesn't provide propotional breaking but for a simple brake controller it is the easiest to install (installs in any position) and easiest to use that myself and my buddies have found.  It just requires power, ground, and one wire to break pedal switch, as well as a  power output to your trailer brakes.  If your rig is prewired - all you need is the adapter plug for your make and model of vehicle and you simply plug it in, mount it in place and your done.  My particular vehicle was not prewired but installing and running the wiring, plugs and a circuit breaker (local auto parts store) and testing just took a couple of hours.After installation, you start your rig and trailer rolling and set the breaking level with the little thumb wheel (the display shows the output voltage to the trailer brakes) to just before the brakes on your trailer lock up and then back off slightly.  Your then set and ready to go!We liked best-1.That you can install it any position2. It performs a continuous self check and if everything is working properly is shows a  little "C" on the screen (for connected and working properly)  When breaking it shows the breaking voltage applied to the trailer brakes.  If your not connected properly to the trailer it just shows a blank screen with a decimal point.3. It was easy to install, setup and use and will handle up to 3 axles and has worked flawlessly over the last several thousand miles of trailer driving. I have tested it on the plains, rolling hills and mountains and its really nice to find a product that I can highly recommend.For the money I would have to give it a best value rating.  The next step up would be a controller with proportional breaking control which gets up into the high dollar units, starting around $200-Scott
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderInstalled in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.Fits my '06 Toyota Tacoma just fine.  What can I say... it's a new drain plug and comes with the nylon gasket.  Replaced my old smashed one like a charm.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation. Great valuie.This is a nice beefy wiper blade. It's much heavier duty than the OEM blades on our Mazda. The blade surface is sturdier and it has a heavily sculpted airfoil surface on top that helps to add positive pressure to the blade and provide better wiping action.These blades took about a five-Mississippi to install (one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, three-Mississippi, four-Mississippi, five-Mississippi, done!).The price is reasonable, the quality is outstanding, and the installation was simple. Winner!The filter works very well but the real plus side on the K&N is the hex head which makes filter removal a real snap.

It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.

strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked.Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.

These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.

Both of my older cars had their factory nozzles falling apart thanks to arizona sun. I ordered these, funny they are same help brand sold at the zone, and installed them in 1 minute. They work great, yes you adjust them by just pushing the metal nozzle around, which you can do with factory nozzles as well. I prefer these spray pattern over factory. Factory was just like 2 streams, like a water gun, these are two fans of spray. The factory streams barely covered the window, these cover the whole thing in 2 seconds.Installed these with the KC windsheild mounts on my 90 YJ. The harness and instructions were really easy to follow .Installed in less than 2 hours with everything tied down and hidden. My wife and I were out in the jeep looking at Christmas lights and I was on a dark road and flipped them on. WOW! These 130W daylighters definetely light up the road. They were so bright my wife asked if they were legal.Several things, you have two grounds, make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface, I used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment.If you have a narrow mounting location, you may want to consider the slim lights, these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight.The only negative thing I can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the 80's. I painted mine black and placed a vinyl KC sticker on them. Looks much better, but still ordered the KC rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them. (5 stars if they would have come with a rock guard cover, instead of the solid yellow smiley faces.)i just had to remove these on two vehicles,not these i mean the tinted ones. i had em on my truck for six years but now the cops are enforcing the law. Anything that blocks view or changes the color of the plate is not legal in a lotta states. I hope the cops dont mind these clear ones...
Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLDo you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.
Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .
What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know.I think it is a must when you own a Hi-Lift and your car have soft (plastic) bumpers.Just one suggestion, please read carefully how to operate this product because if you don't do it you have the risk to break it as happened to one friend last weekend when we went off-road.must have accesory if you use a bucket to wash your car - so common sense that it makes me wonder why someone didn't think to make this 30 years ago
This rain suit is awesome for the money iam a motorcycle safety instructor and this is the kinda of product i recommend new students purchase its made great and can be seen in the rainI bought this tool to help remove stuck windshield wiper arms from BMW's and it works great. Many models have wedge shaped wiper arm posts that are often difficult to remove the wiper arm. Honestly I have never had a stuck battery terminal that I could not easily remove in my 30+ years of wrenching so I cannot give a performance rating in this area since I have never experienced it. But it looks to be up to the task if needed. I own several quality Lisle tools and this tool is no exception. It is sturdy and well made for the price and its intended purpose. My only beef is that the product does NOT match the stock photo. The center adjustable wedge nut is NOT metal as shown in the picture. It is constructed of a dense plastic albeit a higher quality plastic. But plastic is plastic and sellers should not be allowed to misrepresent products they sell. With that said I was alerted to this beforehand by another Amazon reviewer. The plastic wedge nut does not detract from the tools purpose. This is something I am OK with but must point out that the seller misrepresented the product. That is the only reason I knocked it down one star. Due to many sellers having back-stock there are some that still have the version with the metal wedge nut so this fact could be upsetting for customers expecting the exact product represented in the photo. Kind of like ordering a Made in the USA tool only to receive a Chinese version in the package. Please post an updated product photo or at the very least clearly post a warning that the product received may be different than the one represented in the photo.Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it.
I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. After removing the cap I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap that came with the cap, see my other review. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. This rotor was a PITA to remove! Due to the lousy cap, the rotor was rusted on and had to be cut off. Even after installing the new one, I tried to remove it just out of curiosity and it was very hard to remove. I've never had this problem with OEM parts. I won't buy this rotor or the matching cap again.I got this fix the nozzles on my cruiser, I thought they were clogged up. Turns out the crapstic plastic tubes had broken and separated from the fluid line. I have to jimmy rig the old tube with the new tubes that came in the package. I had to slice the tubes, below the L joint connectors (Be careful slicing, its easier to cut to little, then too much. I almost cut too much.). The will the supplied connectors from the package, I connected the old and new tube together. The rest was just installed the new nozzles and tightening them down. My method was perfect or even near OEM, but it was cheap and works well.I previously used a bosch wiper blade with brackets and noticed that it was starting to streak. When I went to check the blade, I noticed that the entire wiper blade was coming off the hook and it was barely holding on. How dangerous is that? Not only could it have hurt someone if it came off, I could've put myself and other vehicles at risk if it did fall off when it was raining.The direct connect system which snaps shut to ensure that the blade will not wiggle off provided me ease of mind and the design of a spoiler to increase contact to the windshield wiper while you are driving.. Brilliant! No streaking so far and it is quiet on my 2005 Corolla S. Its a great investment because the bracketed wiper blades are obsolete compared to this.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations, this is it. If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it. Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt. Its going to shine. Great automotive or household maintenance product.Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.
I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks.So these aren't the best cables you can buy.  For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: "My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine."  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.  Remember too to clean and inspect your cables after each use to prolong their life and keep you safe.NXT Tech 2.0 was okay, but not great for a synthetic wax containing no carnauba. It didn't really last long in terms of water beading after a few washes/rainy weather. I'd recommend picking up some Collinite 845 if you want that deep shine of a carnauba, but the durability of a synthetic that'll last longer than this minus the shiny marketing scheme. For even longer lasting durability (with carnauba), I would recommend Collinite 476.I've always wondered why Collinite never utilized Amazon Prime because it is a great way to find great/proven products. Based on reviews about their products, they rely solely on word of mouth and apparently are one of those brands (Zaino, DoDo Juice, PoorBoys) that just don't market. It seems that in the waxing world, the best products are harder to find.I apologize for ranting about Collinite when this is supposed to be about NXT 2.0, but if you really care about your car, you owe it to yourself to give Collinite a shot and see for yourself.You have the option to disagree with me and ignore my review, but just take a minute to look up Collinite and decide. You'll be glad you did.
I use this filter to fill up my 45 gallon water tank as well as using it inline on the city water connection.  That way I'm assured fresh, clean water if I'm dry-camping or at a FHU campsite!  Sometimes I go the extra distance to fill up a couple of Britta Water Filter bottles and put them in the fridge for cold, fresh water!I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway.If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.
This works much better than any dinky siphon pump they sell on this site and at auto zone.This makes changing rear differential fluid much easier!  If you don't have a drain plug or the cover does not remove you can suck out the old then add new using this unit too.If your transmission does not have a drain plug and you want to change whats in the pan you can suck out from the dipstick tube and add new.This tool has come in handy many times and has not developed any leaks.Works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower!It even has a lip on the top so the oil won't go out of the funnel.The only problem with funnels is, you never know how full the chamber is,and always need to remove the funnel to look. Someone should invent a meter on the funnel, that helps in overflowing,and an end valve in case the chamber is full, to prevent it from overflowing.But until then, this funnel will do just fine!...oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now.
Of course made in China but OK for the price. Useful to have but don't bank on it if you exceed 5000 pounds (not 10,000 as stated). The receiver tube is of a thinner gauge hence it feels light. The hook feels solid and the inside weld is plentiful. Remember, a chain is as strong as its weakest link.I give three stars because of the price, delivery but not the Quality. OK for light duty usebody is plastic, as some have mentioned (and the 2 halves don't really line up properly, factory dies must not be the greatest, no big deal) - but I can see metal heat sinks inside, through the front vent holes. no fan, which is one less thing to break down, but it does get more than a little warm with only a 48W load. actually even with zero load is still a bit warm.no fuse on the 12v socket. but - most things you'd plug into this product, come with built in fuse anyway. but still for safety it would be nice if this product also had its own fuse. but given the very inexpensive price, yeah ok understandable.Although not a true trickle charger, it still works fine.  The size is compact, so it's easy to use.  I hope it doesn't die on me, but so far no problems.
This RTV is intended for primary use as engine gasket maker - temperature and oil resistant. But it also works well as general purpose RTV when the near-black (dark gray) color is desirable. Which was true for my application - making gaskets for mounting car speakers in odd sized door application that required custom spacers. Worked great.The dark color is especially troublesome to get off the hands - use disposable gloves during application.This package, a small &#34;squeeze&#34; tube is not easiest for application of a regular bead. It is easier to use the slightly larger, calk-gun sized package, so consider that if the larger quantity is also helpful.The instruction is kind of hard to follow. But it works pretty well if you do it right. It is a little big for storage but most of grease comes with big tube. I am not sure if there is any small tube grease. I use grease for cars/garage door, machines,...There are plenty of spray waxes on the market.  I've used Mothers, Meguiars,  TW, Duragloss, and quite a few others.  There is nothing that comes close to the durability of Optimum.  It actually outlasts regular paste waxes.Pros:-Awesome durability for a spray wax-Real wax looks, great depth and warm glow-Super easy to use-Smells great-A little goes a LONG way, use sparinglyCons:-streaks when used on a hot car, though this really isn't a con, its more of a DUH.-streaks if you use too much, again, is that really a con?This is a huge value, while it appears it is more expensive than a regular spray wax, it goes twice as far easily, and I bet most people are used to using way more, and thus get streaking.  I'd estimate I get twenty, yes 2-0 cars per bottle.  Great stuff, my favorite spray wax for dark colors.
This is heavy duty and very reliable. It will go a long time without a charge and still crank over an engine. Well worth the money for the peace of mind.This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump.
Use this for oil changes on my Subaru BRZ and it works great. Just stick the extension that has a smaller tube size right into the dip stick tube.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.Does exactly what it's supposed to do,fit low and snug on the filter cover. To work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment.Recommended for sure!The instruction is kind of hard to follow. But it works pretty well if you do it right. It is a little big for storage but most of grease comes with big tube. I am not sure if there is any small tube grease. I use grease for cars/garage door, machines,...
Nice brush.  Does what it is made to do and cleanup is easy.  Which the handle was longer so I could get deeper into the drum.Almost nothing to it, mass wise, has an adhesive disc on the back approximately 1.5" across, slightly off-center.  The actual mirror part thought seems to be silvered plastic (no surprise), but arrived with what appears to be scuffing directly from the packaging itself.  As long as there isn't a light source in the reflection, it's barely noticeable, but it's there.The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletDoes exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.does what its supposed to do. it carry's gas from the tank to the hose then on to the rv.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.Needed to replace the handle clips for my Silverado tailgate. The OEM parts were too expensive for this small part. There worked GREAT and the price was right!!Works great for smaller seals but it couldn't pull out the rear main seal for a 2002-2006 MINI Cooper. These are very large seals. The tool just couldn't provide enough leverage for that. I used a flat blade screwdriver instead. Perfect tool for small and medium size seals.
This is a great price for the cover and the filter.I paid less than $9 for both and they are OEM replacement parts.Great dealBest choice for the price point research shows penzoil outperforms Mobil 1 in wear test, number one is amsoil but royal purple is a close second and for the money it is number one. Mobil 1 just has excellent marketing it truly is JUNK, but keep buying it if you buy into the marketing lie ; ) .This stuff is expensive and you only get a small amount.  Lets face it, 32oz is a medium soda.  MOTHERS, please give us a little more for the $, your product is great though.  4 stars for quality, loses the 5th for the amount you get for the $.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Overall this is a great test lead kit.  The probe wires are made of high quality flexible wire.  The alligator clips and grabber hooks are well made and connect to the ends of the test probe.  This is a great addition to an electrical tool box.Great hydraulic oil. Quality comes in an entire package. This includes the container, the pouring spout and the way the spout can be retracted with the cap on for storage. One can is enough to flush and refill the entire power steering unit.j After changing the fluid, my power steering is noticeable smoother and quieter. Very pleased with the performance of the product.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
These are the best wiper blades I have used -- much better than other Rain-X blades. My only complaint is they are ugly. The connector is bulky and the arms are all plastic, making them look cheap. I would give these an extra star if they were lower profile. That being said, I would definitely recommend them.I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.I actually bought these for my Lotus, they are an affordable alternative to the other flat top jackstands on the market. They work as they should and the price was great. With a car that only weighs 2,000lbs the 6,000lbs each is complete overkill. Note: Not to lift anything.
does the job.Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.Based upon condition of your wheels, the cleaner does require some elbow scrubbing but does a descent job. Hope this helps.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).
I got this an an extra after i Damaged the original and as expected it is a perfect fit!.  Good to have a spare sometimes!!!!.This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?
CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is.Considering these stands cost about four times as much as a lot of others, and considering the five star reviews, I was expecting perfection.  Unfortunately, they have design flaws.First, the packing sucks.  Two stands come packed together in one box with bits of cardboard that are supposed to prevent the two stands and the two separated stand arms from rubbing together.  I'm not sure if they scraped through the cardboard or if it just shifted, but all of my stands have scrapes on them and in one place the metal is rusting where the paint was scraped.  The manual says if you see rust to scrape it off and repaint it.  I shouldn't have to do that when they're new due to bad packing.  Also, the scrapes reveal just how imperceptibly thin the paint actually is.The description says "Formed base adds stability and helps reduce sinkage into pavement".  When I think "formed base" I think formed as one solid piece.  Instead, the base has tiny triangles of metal welded to the _inside_ of each foot.  Then they carefully take a picture of the stand so you can't see what they did till you get it.  That would still be acceptable except they made no effort to level either the feet or the triangles.  On many of the feet, the triangle sits too deep in the foot so it wouldn't even touch the pavement until the foot edge had dug into the pavement.  In other cases, an edge of a crooked triangle will form a divot in the pavement before the rest of the foot or triangle touches ground.  They could have splurged for a tiny bit more metal to make the triangles large enough to rest the edge of each foot on the triangle, then set the whole thing on a flat surface while the triangles were welded.  I've seen other stands with that design.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the arm that locks the stands at a particular height doesn't move very far and so it's hard to tell by looking if the lock is engaged.  I agree this is a problem and I wish the teeth were deeper so it was easier to tell when a locking arm was fully engaged.  However, it's probably not really an issue because the weight of the yellow bar and the shape of the teeth and locking bar will force the locking bar to fully engage.  Even if the locking bar is rusty enough to prevent the weight of the yellow bar from fully locking it, the weight of the car certainly will.  I could possibly imagine a case where the tip of the locking bar is barely touching a tooth of the yellow bar and putting weight on the yellow could cause a failure, but I couldn't get it to sit like that when trying, so it's pretty unlikely.  However, as the jacks get rusty and teeth possibly wear, or if you simply get one with a small manufacturing defect, such a situation could become more likely.  So I'm not a fan of this design where locking can't easily be confirmed visually.  Even if they had made it so the locking arm sits perfectly horizontal while locked and an inch off horizontal when unlocked it would have been better.While doing my tests with the locking bar I created quite a bit of shaved yellow paint particles just from moving the yellow bar up and down by hand.  This is probably typical of the paint used on jack stands and maybe there's no avoiding it, but it certainly doesn't seem that they used any sort of premium paint.  The coating of yellow paint does seem to be thicker than the coating of blue paint, at least.I don't think the description (or the 3-ton label on each stand) makes it very clear that the 3 ton rating is per PAIR, not per stand.  You have to read the manual to find that out.  They also have big warnings in two places in the manual not to put a car on four stands.  Since it's fairly common for people to put cars onto four jack stands, I don't know if that warning is just there to cover their butts in case someone lifts a car wrong onto four stands and it falls over during lifting or if there's something about these particular stands that makes them bad for using four at once.  Perhaps the bases are just too small.  Of course, using four stands in earthquake country is just asking for trouble so that could be another reason.In case anyone was wondering, these stands only lock at a particular position.  Just because the description says "ratchet" doesn't mean you can ratchet them up while the car's weight is on them.  If you manage to move the locking bar with the car's weight on the stand (which actually shouldn't be possible due to the shape of the teeth), the stand will collapse to its lowest level.Wow, this stuff works well!  We have a wall air conditioner in our home.  It is a quiet variety that we paid a good deal of money for, due to that claim.  It still had a bad resonance of some vibrating metal on the machine.I applied this to all accessible (front face) surfaces, and only the spots where there was not a decal or other item present, probably less than 30% of the total frontal surface (keep in mind 50% is the evaporator and blower vent), and the available space on the front cover.  Wow, we can definitely hear a difference in the room it is installed in.This thing has a strong resonance, so we can still hear it in other spaces.  I feel like it doesnt dampen all modes, but it certainly does enough for a noticeable difference in the space where we have the AC located.
A snap to install, and easily transferred from one vehicle to another. I couldn't believe all the information that you can get off of the car's computer system.We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered.The reason I am giving the lock three stars is the lock would not work for our trailer hitch. we have a Lance trailer and the hitch was to wide for the lock to fit over. I may grind down the sides of our hitch so I may use it, I will check with Lance first so not to weeken the hitch if for and reason it may then the reese lock is unuseable for my lance trailer and I will pass the lock on to someone who can use it.
I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well .I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.Put on 2009 Street Bob.  Stickers came off fine.  Fits at the A section of the front frame, little hole there.  Find a bolt, done.  (Well, that and plug it in).
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...The perfect size for fueling equipment or transfering fuel to other containers. No spills or splashes even if I get a little careless.The screen keeps those pesky bugs out of my tanks, and might even survive a dropped oil plug.I bought this for my 2012 Forest River R-Pod 177 stock tongue jack.  It fits on the post just fine with no modifications to either the jack post or the foot plate required.  I agree with some of the other posts that suggest that a weep hole be drill into the plate to allow fluid to drain.

Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter.

What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.There are many other products like the ctech but this is clearly one of the highest quality. The best part is there are optional wires that fit many needs or if you have multiple vehicles.
These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.jWorks great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions.
I use this power adapter to test equipment (small tire air compressor, USB Power Adapters) along with charging batteries in my home. This Power Adapter is made of good quality and has lasted over 2 years without any problems. Well worth buying.connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect.This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor.
This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.
I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck.

But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Installed this with a Curt hitch on a 2002 crv. It plugs into the ready made connection by the driver side quarter panel. I store the extra cord beneath the table in the storage area and just run the cord out through the rear door when towing. The weatherstripping protects the wiring from damage. Very easy and no splicing and wiring to mess with. Hope this review helps.
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.I just installed these today. It took about 5 non-hurried minutes each. The old ones were held in with one screw each under the gutter's rubber trim. These are nice and big and should really cut back on the amount of black streaks.These jack stands are awesome....very tall.  My jeep has 4-5 inch of lift and is sitting on 35s.  These stands have no problems holding it off the ground with lots of room to spare!
A great product you must use at least once in a while. Really does make a difference on your vehicle.Probably the best in oil filters around, kn builds great products and this is not the exception; if you care for the best for your lovely car, this is your oil filter (see application list for your car)This product is a money saver and a must have in your garage if you are either do it urselfer or a professional
I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.The reason I gave this item a 4 star review is because I think they should be included with any package purchase of Tri-Lynx blocks.  They are a nessesatiy if you are using your blocks under your landing gear or rear stabilizers.I actually bent a foot pad on a rear stabilizer when using the blocks before I purchased the caps.  Now that I have a set of caps the blocks work great.I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror.
Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me.What else can you ask for? 3 Ton and light weight plus locking mechanism is way safer than the wedge cuts in regular ramps.I suggest that they cover the top with a rubber pad or silicon piece to help protect car and standVery quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back.I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.
Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.Bought this to use on my 08 4Runner. Converts the factory socket into a 4 prong flat connector to use with most common uHaul trailer wiring. Works great, seems well made. Only gripe is that it doesn't seem to fit with a reassuring snap or click or anything of that sort. You push it in and have to sort of guess if you got it right.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
What else can you ask for? 3 Ton and light weight plus locking mechanism is way safer than the wedge cuts in regular ramps.I suggest that they cover the top with a rubber pad or silicon piece to help protect car and standwith plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal.Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror.
The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderWorks just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento.

Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
No issues, just as described.  Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger.  Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone.3M knows how to make sandpaper. When you get to 2000 grit you're really polishing. I use this prior to polishing something.Does what it says it does.  Easy to install, and once adjusted will bring your car to the exact same spot every time.  Fast delivery, and excellent quality item.
changed engine oil on my equinox. just make sure it will work on your type of car. other wise it will give you pain like one of my friends. when it works, it is super cool. not a single drop of oil on the floor.Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank you
Purchased as a replacement for a 2004 Ford Taurus.  Lasted about 7 months before it burned out.  Replaced this item with NGK brand, OEM manufacturer.  I do not recommend this item if you plan on keeping the car.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderworks fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander

bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do.I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.
They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage, from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges. I need to buy another pack though, for the back doors protection too, as it is not long enough for both doors. We don't need it for the back doors very often, but I think it will come in handy at times. Since we like this so much, we will be buying another.If it moves and it shouldn't, Loctite.  I like to use this for small items that I will need to take apart in the future, but I do not want to have loosen up during use.  Like tiny screws in a gun or something else small and hard to replace.
No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.I have a GM 1995 OBDI engine and the adapter they shipped for GM did not fit my connector so I had to return the whole unit.  I'm now back to grounding out the data pin and watching the flash code on the check engine light for trouble codes.  It's important to check your adapter fit before purchase since that's what you will rely on to get the data into the unit.I liked the unit's design - it came in two zipper bags that zipped together to hold the cables and adapters in one bag and hold the tool and book in a separate pouch.  You can also unzip one zipper and lay them side by side to go in a tool box drawer.I wish the adapter would have fit my vehicle - if it did I would have kept this unit because of all the features it offers.I have used these for years on motorcycles and cars. At work these get used on floor sweepers, generators, hydraulic pumps, anything that has a battery that needs to work but may sit for a long time. Unlike most charger/maintainers, this has a de-sulfate mode that can bring back abused batteries. Sometimes you need a dedicated charger to get them going and then this to condition them. Unless you have plenty of time to spare, in which case this will eventually bring back a worn down battery. Has the common two prong connector, alligator clips to go directly to battery terminals and enough cord length to be useful. The only gripe I have is the serial number on the registration card is the same for all of them. There is a statement that I can get an LED display with registering the unit. I have done this and eventually received a display unit about 2 months later. Then I found them for $4 at Harbor Freight. For the money, these maintain your batteries and work well. They will take up space on an outlet strip though.
Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!If you are going to have oil change at home than you must have this good US made oil filter tool.
From what I can tell from my research, this contains the same ingrediants as in Techron.  I put in an ounce or two each time we fill it up somewhere that doesn't have Techron in their gas already (like Sam's & Costco).  We aren't consistant enough to know if it makes a difference in gas mileage or not, but my hope is that doing this prevents us from having to do a fuel system cleaning.I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car.I came to know about this tool when I was browsing the web for finding the details how to look for Hybrid Battery temperature on my recently acquired used 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid. The forum suggested to their members thatScanGauge IIwould be the ideal choice to monitor the Motor Electronics Coolant Temp (MeC) and HV Battery temperature (Traction Battery Temp).I am pleased to inform that this tool can be configured with Ford Specific XGauges (See comments) to achieve that feat pretty easily. Ford Escape Hybrid (With Navigation) does have host of other real-time display like HV battery SOC real-time MPG on the dash but FORD hides most of the stuff from user which are needed to troubleshoot common check engine light errors and in my case why my FORD escape Hybrid sometimes decides not to turn off the Internal combustion engine (ICE) and keeps running the Radiator FANs when it should not. It baffled me for couple of weeks and led me to investigate the issue further.After setting this tool up and monitoring it for several days I could see a pattern that there are two main reason why the ICE would not shut down at idle or at a stop light. They were primarily due to 'over-temp' condition of the Motor Electronics Coolant temperature caused by a weak MCE coolant pump in conjunction with the HV battery Traction battery temperature.Replacing the nearly failed original 2006 Motor electronics Coolant Pump at 98,XXX miles (FORD OEM PART number 5M6Z-8C419-A) It did help in cooling the Motor electronics coolant temperature a little bit however the traction battery FANS are still an issue which I am continuing to investigate using this Automotive computer Gauge.FYI, There is a disturbing trend in these line of 2005-2007 FORD Escape hybrid vehicles that calls for Air-Conditioning compressor to turn ON as soon as the HV battery temp reaches 95 to 96.8 F to cool the battery using the rear air-conditioning contraption by opening the blend door and what not but as your car ages the Internal two fans housed inside the HV battery tends to fail slowly (without actually flagging any DTC codes) and thereby no matter how much AC compressor works hard (Only with ICE running) it cannot cool the HV battery enough to go under 94F for the ICE to stop at idle or at a STOP sign.It is winter here in California and thanks for mother nature my HV battery rarely calls for cooling for most of the stop and go traffic and I still have not ventured to replace the two Internal HV battery FANs (FORD OEM PART 5M6Z-10C659-A) on my Ford Escape Hybrid but I do closely monitor the temperatures using this valuable tool.Bottom line: An excellent tool to have for any gasoline or diesel engines for real-time MPG and RPM readings as well as read understand and clear (Check Engine Light) DTC codes. Well worth the price as it pay for itself in less than a year if you come across a check engine light and could decode yourself and clear it. Or just by using this tool to carefully change your driving habits and improving the gas mileage.I am amazed how crazy some drivers are who accelerate hard cut in front of you, overtake you just to stop in front of you at a STOP Light. Did you know how much Gas you could save just by decelerating slowly and watch for the traffic pattern ahead of you? - You can save nearly 30% of your gas tank not to mention less wear and tear of you brakes and other stuff when you learn to drive less aggressively.Drive safe!, Drive intelligently and save on gas!Cheers!
I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel.  The kit was perfect and the tools were decent.  My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made.  Global economy or whatever, when I'm looking for quality tools, I'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices.  Sure, these are better than Harbor Freight, but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.But that is a rant to have another day, and I can point you towards a better kit for now.  So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA.I used this video to quiet a steel enclosure for a CNC mill. The product works perfectly. The amount I bought was overkill, but I saved on shipping and actual product price. My plan is to contact local stereo installers to see if they want to buy my surplus. If not, there are a myriad of items in my home that need some damping :) Used a wallpaper seam roller which worked fine.I admittedly didn't see the sound byte of the horn until now, and if I had heard it earlier, I would have thought differently. I installed this to have a lower, and hopefully louder tone in my horn. The factory horn was lower though. I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now, so on an Isuzu Trooper, it is a little pathetic. I blame this on myself though, and I realize the product is good for its intended audience. Just don't buy this if you havea  truck! The look of this horn, if you have it visible, is a plus, and the shipping and installation were a breeze.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!I am happy with this purchase. I already knew these magnetic part pans are excellent. If you will use it a lot, get one.Love this product. I am wheelchair bound and use this to charge my chair when I'm in the van. Great product
The good:  It adds significant security to a trailer.  The lock for the coupler latch can fit the wider models.  The lock that fits in the tongue where the hitch ball goes is easy to get on and off.Why it doesn't get five stars:1:  The lock for the coupler latch, even when lubricated and the cover on was a PITA to get the key inserted and wiggled in after the trailer was in one place for a couple months.  I was fearing that the key would break.2:  The tongue lock, it was hard to tell where to pull out the key.Would I buy this again?  Yes.  However, the lock for the coupler latch, I would throw away, and instead, I would consider using a long shackle padlock, or a lock that has an automotive-grade cylinder.  In all cases, I'd use some Tri-Flow or another locksmith-grade lubricant in all locks (NOT WD-40!)Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3.
These wipers do what they are supposed to do... Clear the window of liquid debris.  I would give the wipers about 4 stars cause I have noticed from time to time not the best performance but overall very good.This review actually comes in mostly due to the amazing customer service I received from Valeo.  When I was picking up one of my wiper blades, the plastic piece fell apart rendering the wiper blade utterly useless. I decided to search reviews on amazon to see if anyone else had the problem.  I found another review like mine and that reviewer said that they e-mailed the company and got replacement plastic clips.So I decided to e-mail the company and Watkins Devane replied back with in about 20 minutes.  After supplying my car information and model number of the wiper blade I had issues with, I was sent replacement parts that arrived in about 2 days.  Installed new clip and wiper works great again.Just a tip, if you plan on e-mailing the company with an issue like this, provide your car make, model, and year along with the wiper blade model number to expedite the process.I have a 1970 American Motors AMX with the bittersweet orange color which I bought new and drove until 1983.  Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime.  Its only use has been to serve as our cats "perch".  You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked.  Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try.  So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.  I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.  After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.  I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.  So I applied a second coat of cleaner.  That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, followed by the step 2 sealer, and step 3 carnuba wax has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.  They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).  But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.  I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.  In my mind, that's a small price to pay.I will be posting this same review under the step two and step three products to help anyone who may miss this particular review.  The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit.  You can save a few bucks on shipping to buy it that way.Happy Waxin'... &lt;>&lt;Since this product is designed to be used as a 3-Step system, along with the cleaner and carnuba wax, this review was also posted under the Step 1 and Step 3 products to help anyone who may miss one of the products...I have a 1970 American Motors AMX with the bittersweet orange color which I bought new and drove until 1983.

These Hopkins "Graduated Levels" come two to pack and are exactly what we needed for our new "pop-up" camper. These can be installed using the included double-stick tape or, more permanently, using the two pre-drilled screw holes (screws not included). We opted for the double-stick tape option since I really didn't want to put holes in my camper walls.These levels are easy to read from a distance and are very accurate.Highly Recommended!CFHWe use 3 different battery tenders on our ATV's and mobility chair. None are in the same place, and we need the option of different length cords so we can park them where we want and no right next to an electrical outlet. Even with the extension cords these have performed flawlessly--one of them for over 3 years now. We used to go through ATV batteries about every 2 years--by keeping the batteries charged with these devices, they are lasting at least 4 years so far (keeping our fingers crossed).  These things are running 24/7 and we've never had a problem.Bought a bunch of these and popped them onto my 2003 Honda Shadow Spirit 750. They fit perfectly and seem to be working fine so far. Beats spending two or three times that (or more) from the local auto shop, that's for sure.
For long term accuracy you will have to screw these to your RV. Or you can buy a carpenters level on Amazon and place it on the Floor of your RV to check it for level.You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
Looks like your standard tire plug. I keep this in my trunk in case I ever get a &#34;good&#34; flat so I won't have to solely rely on the donut spare that came with the car.Used this tool to remove my fuel line on a fuel filter change...OMG I was under the truck for over a hour wrestling with it! Eventually the tool broke! What a piece of junk! I ordered the metal sissor one off of Amazon, got the fuel line off in 2 minutes!!! LITERALLY! I heard the click, and the fuel filter just came out! Save yourself some time and aggrevation...if you have a Ford truck, get the sissor tool, not this plastic junk.I used this for an oil change on a 2007 Saturn Vue Hybrid. I find it odd how the GM ecotec have the oil filter canister right below the exhaust manifold. This socket fits under it without a problem allowing it to have room to unscrew the filter out of the canister. Worth the buy if you ever plan on changing the oil in your GM Ecotec vehicle! Or just to have in general in case you ever get a friend to change your oil for you!
This valve is exactly what I needed to make draining the hot water tank in my RV a breeze. Unfortunately, it arrived with a quality control problem - the T-handle was not properly crimped onto the valve shaft. The first time I tried to use the valve, the handle came right off in my hand. Rather than fool aroung with the nuisance of returning it, I reworked the crimp with a hammer & punch. I was able to make it secure enough that I can use the valve without the handle coming loose. Hopefully, it will not work loose & be lost due to vibrations on the road.I've used my Mityvac 7201 less than 10 times.  I have treated it very carefully, as I do all my stuff.  But still, it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate.  I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).  I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray, and operating it repeatedly.  But (1) It's still not easy to operate, and (2) I shouldn't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove.  It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement "Tube Connector Kit" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.  I had not noticed this before, but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil!  When I use it in dispense mode now, the main tube doesn't leak anymore, but air and oil come out from under the top plate.  I removed the top plate, and sure enough, "Look Ma, no seal!"  It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed, but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable.  Because I didn't notice this problem sooner, the seal (822821) is costing me an additional $13, including a ridiculous $8.75 fee for shipping.Now I've added (not replaced--added) the top seal, and while doing a test, I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly.  I give up on this thing.This would be a great practical joke if it didn't cost me so much money.Given the tight space, it is hard to take off the filter housing without this tool.  Still, I hope someone will invent a better tool because it stuck to the housing when I took the housing off and when I put the housing back on.  I'll drill a couple of holes as suggested by some of the reviewers.  Still, I'll avoid buying Toyota next time becaue it is such a chore to change oil.
7 Prong connector is the best for use in any towing situation even if you only need a flat 4 lead connection.  This unit is well used on rigs where you may run into many towed vehicle applications that do not match the 7 pole set up.  4 pole is at the ready if you need it.Very easy to use and I have not had any issues with sealing properly. I only wish that you could program 2 vehicles to it. I highly recommend it and will be buying a couple for gifts.Battery Tenders are a requirement if you want a recreational vehicle/ collector car / motorcycle battery to last through winter storage. I have used these for several years and can attest to their value.I would recommend this product for maintaining battery health.
I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different.I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLThis covers all bases and should be in every campers backup check list. Does it all and you can see the results through the clear plastic.Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.Once you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it.Tore the bumper on my RV. I do not blame this thing for the problem, the bumper just could not handle the force of two bikes and a bike rack ( total weight about 80 lbs ) running down a bumpy road. It started to tear a hole near the weld to the frame of the trailer. Did not notice it for a few days until I could see the bike rack sagging. Don't get me wrong, this thing is built VERY solidly ( and mounts perfectly to a 4&#34; square bumper ). I am really writing this to warn others thinking of using this as I did. You really need someone to weld something to the bumper to make it stronger ( or replace the bumper with a stronger one ) before using this, or maybe use a very light bike rack with a very light bike.
There are heavier-duty covers that would be more appropriate for daily use where you don't have protected parking (like apartments or townhouses), but I have a garage, so a cover isn't necessary at home. However, if you travel regularly, this cover is convenient to pack (it comes with it's own little storage bag), doesn't take much in the way of storage space, and is excellent protection against rain and dust when covered parking isn't available. I just added another touring bike to my garage, so this will travel with it. Do not consider using it on a bike that's being trailered, this is a very-general purpose cover, and there's too much loose material for it to be a good choice for a bike being towed at highway speeds.The size is deceiving. I got this for my dad who was kind of used to those heavy metal-cased chargers that need special care not to destroy the battery. The nice thing about these CTEK chargers are that they are &#34;smart&#34; and require no special treatment. It really is idiot proof: just plug and play.And I can attest to the &#34;reconditioning&#34; feature. It will NOT resurrect a totally dead battery, but if you have an old battery that's marginal (meaning it is borderline: may or may not start your car/tractor/whatever), it will make it better! We tested this on a marginal tractor battery. It only started if it felt like it before, but after reconditioning it was significantly better.The only feature I wish it had was a &#34;boost&#34; feature. But any charger with a useful boost feature of any use has to be a really large one so it would be impossible to fit that feature in this form factor. A spare battery is better than any &#34;boost&#34; feature anyways. You'd be better off keeping a spare battery sitting around to jump start your vehicles. I kept my old car battery, reconditioned it and leave it charged in my garage for that purpose.This air station started paying for itself from the first use.  With gas stations charging 50 cents and more for air these days, this is very nice to have on hand.  Here are some things to keep in mind when using.1. You need an extension cord.  The unit's cord is way to small to reach around cars.2. This has a small piston so it will take time to fill car/truck tires. Bicycle tires fill faster.3. Invest in a good tire gauge.  There are a lot of good digital or dial gauges that are very accurate.  The station has a gauge on top that can be set to what pressure is needed but it isn't completely accurate.4. The pumping noise is what should be expected from this small inflator.  I have a 12-volt inflator that sounds like a high-pitched mini jet engine so this B&D; is quiet in comparison.5.  The valve adaptor is hard plastic but has not been a problem.  It would be nice if they would have used brass but then the price would probably be higher.The air station works on AC or DC current and comes with car adaptor, ball needle and extension nozzle.  At $50 it is hard to go wrong here.  If treated right, this little air station will last a long time and pay for itself.  Well worth adding to the garage for car, truck, bicycle tires and all those sports balls.
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...
My son and I completed an 18 hour motorcycle training course this weekend, which included 10 hours of riding in the rain. Knowing the forecast was for rain I purchased this suit just for the training. Not only did we have rain almost 100% of the time, but the Saturday portion was with 10-25mph winds all afternoon.I'm pleased with the construction, design, and material used for this Rain Suit. Also the size chart turned out to be correct for me. I wear size L to XL. I ordered XL and it is large enough for me to wear over my jeans and a light jacket. Still the pants have sufficient elastic to stay up without a draw string.We were on and off the motorcycles every 15 or 20 minutes. Every time I sat on the motorcycle it was freshly wet from the rain. By the end of the weekend a little water had leaked through in the crotch and my jeans were slightly wet. I'm not sure how that compares with riding 55 mph on the freeway in the rain. Other than that I was perfectly dry.I appreciated the zipper legs which opened the lower pant leg up sufficiently to pull the pants on over my boots.The only annoying thing was the cloth covered bottom part of my helmet kept getting caught on the neck strap Velcro of the suit. I tried several times to adjust the strap so the hook part of the Velcro would be covered but nothing I did prevented the helmet from catching.For the price this is a good suit. It served my purpose this weekend. While I'm not likely to ride in the rain I wouldn't hesitate to use this suit for protection if I had to.I replaced a rear sensor in a 1999 camry 4 cyl with this sensor to eliminate a check engine light failure.  It was easier than using an identical replacement because the cable ran through the floor pan under the driver's seat.  By using this I just cut the wires underneath the car, spliced them with included splices and heat shrink and added a layer of self-sealing rubber tape to protect and waterproof the splices.  No more check engine light for about $30.Update: Replaced the rear sensor on my 1998 camry also with perfect success - they went bad on both cars at around 120000 miles.I have one of these in each of my vehicles, either in the door pocket, center console or glove box.  I didn't mount them because having them loose in a covered compartment seemed a better idea.  I also have the key chain versions (ResQme)as a back-up in case the trapped person cannot reach the one in the door, etc.I have only had to use this device once when a Blazer flipped over on the Interstate in front of me.  The first person on the scene tried several times to break the rear window with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful.  My life-hammer did the job effortlessly with the first swing, and the seat-belt cutter quickly ripped through the belt to release the trapped driver!These should seriously be standard equipment in ALL vehicles!
Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.If you ride around the roads of south Florida then you need this product in your tires. You will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! It worksIt's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it.
I needed an extension for my solar setup and this was the ticket.  It worked great and I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs an extension for their solar system.Bought this to allow the use of the std Tender for an outside car, run this from the garage to the driveway, works just the way it is supposed to...This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
supposed to slip in.. well you gotta smash it in and am scared to try it with my trailer hitch lights.wanna see if I can return itI got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side .I bought this to look in my winch on my Jeep. I just took one of the bolts out and put this in, I would thing if they really want it I'm sure they can get it out, this just makes it a little harder and if you install two they will have to work twice as hard. And for the price you can buy two..
I have used Stant locking caps for years on all my vehicles. This does fit a 2004 Ranger fine but the tether that keeps the gas cap attached to the truck will not work without modifications. There is no slot!........ I  removed the retaining ring on the bottom to see if I could modify it by trimming it down but if you trim it you will remove the ability to keep the ring attached.I ended up trimming the inside of my tether and slipping it over the top of the cap then super gluing a piece of electrical wire around the perimeter as a retainer. It's a lot of hassle to do but I didn't want to use it without the tether.One good thing, I was able to see just how they designed the locking mechanism in these. It is a engineering feat just short of genius, but it is not something that I really needed to know about.Anyways, it works as it should but only time will tell if it throws the check engine light due to a poor seal as some reviewers have stated on here. If it does then I will update my review.Some reviewers received 10510 caps with tether slots and some did not, which leads me to believe Stant must have made a new injection mold die but didn't provide any tether gap in it.Edit 11-12-2013: No problems with check engine light, it's a good seal.Easily flexible, not difficult to work into the slotted channel. Just set one side and work the other as you go across - shouldn't be any need for tools to insert this unless you have screws holding the channel that were not centered and flat in the channel.  If that's the case, you'll want to use a plastic type tool to avoid puncturing the vinyl.Just as it says.  Easy to install, is good quality and functions just as it should.  To install, all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place.  The ring does not have to be removed.  Place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover.  That easy!
Awesome microbfiber towel! I just wish it did not have the tag attached to it - it leaves a mark if you let it contact the surface of your car.CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is.This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove!
While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.This Permatex Ultrablack is wonderful stuff, a tough sealant and it does NOT tend to harden in the tube - - it's always ready to use when I take off the cap. Unfortunately, this particular item is ONLY 1/2 OUNCE!!So it's not a good deal for the price. There is no info in the item posting, you have to notice the image and the "0.5oz" on the package (which I didn't). Go for the 3.5 ounce tube, much better deal.5 stars for the product, 2 stars for the incomplete description.With the cost of this product at about 1/2 of what the General wants for his gear lube for Corvettes and the fact that most GM dealerships install it, it makes very little since to pay the extra money when you exchange it out yearly any way.
just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didThis are sooooo useful. I can't tell you how many of those stupid hooks or fasteners i broke before discovering these in a car forum. I hate those plastic fasteners. This solved my problem, they are perfect and has several different shapes and sizes. Thank god i found these.  I don't understand how people can give these bad ratings.These bulbs are bright, but you need to remember that: Ebay HIDs &#60; These Bulbs &#60; HIR &#60; HID.  If you think that the PNP HIDs are the best thing out there then go buy them if you however want a bright light that will not get you flashed at these are for you.
This air deflector was installed beneath our chest of drawers in the bedroom and is successful at getting the air stream into the main bedroom more quickly. The fact that it can be expanded to cover our 12&#34; wide vents is a plus.My Nissan Quest required a 28" and an 18". It wasn't until after I had them on for a while that I noticed the 28" does not cleanly touch the glass surface in the center of the spread, the point where the blade attaches to the wiper arm. This leaves a wet 2" channel arc right in my line of sight. I thoroughly examined the blade and the attachment, making sure it was attached as intended. It was. My guess is that the pressure that keeps the outer edges of the blade firmly on the glass is so strong it lifts the center up. The 18" appears to be ok. I wish I still had the box to send it back. Now I need another new blade.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.
What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).Used this RTV to create a gasket on an F150 differential cover. Used about 1/3 to 1/2 tube on the diff cover to ensure adequate coverage.  Applied around the bolt holes.  Begins to get tacky in about 5 minutes. Installed diff cover and finger tightened bolts, let set for approx. 1 hour.  Then tightened bolts to OEM specs.  Filled with gear oil and no leaks.
No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them)..i tested it with another gauge and it gave an accurate reading . Make sure you keep it secure to the valve or it will leak air out
I have had this item on my jeep for just about 2 years now.  I need it because of the 35 inch tire on my tailgate covers access to the normal hitch area.  It has been used to haul many items and has worked flawlessly.  ( trailer 5x10, boat, 16ft, and a cargo cart with 300lbs in it )  It has zero rust on it and I am very impressed with it over all.  Also noted that I do a lot of 4x4ing with my jeep and have dropped the rear end off a few steep drops and this extension caught the weight of the jeep without any sort of damage to it.  A++ in my book!I have had experience with dynamat in the past, but had never used it on my vehicles and was a little skeptical.  My car has a factory sub and the rear deck rattled like crazy.  After applying this to the underside the noise is gone.I recently rebuilt the engine on my GSXR and I used this instead of the Suzuki sealant recommended for use in the service manual when putting the case back together. This is a great product and worked great for my application. I have not experienced and leaks or problems by using this product. It has held up the the heat from the engine and has kept the oil inside the case.
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLI wanted some inexpensive seat covers and picked these.  So far they do the job as intended.  Time will tell how they wear and how long they last. As of now I'm satisfied with this purchase.Auto Expressions 5040620 Braxton Grey Bucket Seat CoverNot much to say about these as they aren't really an exciting product, but they are good constuction, they stack nicely when not in use to save space, and they are cheap.  They do the job.
these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the levelWe received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.
What can I say, it's a funnel.  Does the job as expected. Has a nice large fill hole so the liquids go in quickly.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.What else do you need to say?  It's a grit guard for the 2 bucket method.  Cheap and it fits well.
I bought this hitch ball as recommended by Amazon's "buy it together". The draw bar I ordered has a 1" ball mount and the 72802 is a 3/4" ball mount. Now I need to buy a bushing to make it fit. So much on trying to save a buck.The interlock does not work well with the 72802 as the base is too small.Amazon's website says the 15" version of this wiper will fit on a 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  That is not really true.  This wiper was "backwards" what my Cayenne required and I had to spend 15 minutes reversing the rubber to get it to fit the Cayenne.If you have a Porsche Cayenne, try something else.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push downRain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.Bought for an APO address and free shipping, couldn't beat it. When you twist off the bottle cap the remaining ring easily falls off, so be careful if you pour directly into your oil reservoir, don't want the plastic ring falling in with the oil. But use a funnel and you won't have the problem. Will buy again.
One question i have now that i read the bottom of the filter box saying "Made in Mexico"We all know "Made in China" means it was made good but with bad materials, so results can be OK or horrible depending on what it is, but how about filters ?Doing research i found that mexico's advantage could be the shipping price, but not much talk about quality of the assembly or material quality.Like I said in the title of this review what more can I say these product are far superior to anything else out there in the market as far as filters go they are number 1 in my book.  The kit comes with enough product for at least 2 cleanings even if you have the large filter just use the product according to the instructions and you are good to go.  Also let the filter dry COMPLETELY before putting the ol back on the filter.For the price these 4AWG cables can't be beat.  The image clearly shows what you're getting.  I actually made a few jumper cables to connect batteries in parallel in my battery bank.  I bought extra ring terminals to make these jumper cables.
I was looking for this air filter on the K&N website and went to AutoZone priced at 50-60 bucks. I put in my car info said, doesn't fit. BUT, it DOES fit my 2004 Crown Victoria perfectly.I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.Amazon's website says the 15" version of this wiper will fit on a 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  That is not really true.  This wiper was "backwards" what my Cayenne required and I had to spend 15 minutes reversing the rubber to get it to fit the Cayenne.If you have a Porsche Cayenne, try something else.
Recently my lift support arms had gone out and I was doing the vice-grip thing!! I decided to buy and just be done with it. These work great and come with everything you need to install them. You will need a second person to hold the lift gate up while you snap it on, or a long piece of wood like I did. Install took less than 5 minutes per side.This is my second tool, the first one I had to modify the puller tang to work with chainsaw seals...i was going to buy the replacement tangs but they cost almost as much as the tool when you add in shipping so I just got a second one.  If you take your time and ensure the tang fits in the seal this tool is indispensable when replacing shaft type seals (camshaft, crankshaft etc).Love it.**Edit - If you take something away from my post, it is that automakers design cars to run on specific spark plugs. Buy whatever works great for you car, and avoid spark plugs that don't run well. These didn't work in my car, but everyone is different. Check forums to see what works best as well.**I drive a 1998 Honda Civic EX with a VTEC engine. I am currently running NGK V-Power spark plugs and the original factory spark plug wires. I bought these spark plugs to see fuel economy gains and maybe a power increase while merging onto the freeway.They work, but I couldn't tell they were new. MPG's for my car went down to 36, usually 38-40, and so the price didn't match the product well. What I can tell you is that using the right spark plug for your car is key, and trying to eeek out extra MPG's from spark plugs doesn't work so well. I tried Autolites, NGK, etc. iridium plugs and the traditional copper cores work the best. I get 45-50 mpg highway on standard spark plugs.So save your money (I think I spent $16-24 for the set, it's been a while since I returned them) and buy 3-4 sets of copper core NGK V-Power plugs or whatever fits your car.The other thing to note is that replacing severley worn spark plugs with these will net fuel economy gains, but putting any new plugs in will do that. Don't be fooled by these fancy plugs. Shop for your car and check what your car is recommended to use, because that is usually the best option. Your car's computer is programed for the original plugs, not different ones.It's your money, but read the reviews to see if it helps your specific car. It didn't do anything for mine.One plus is that Amazon is amazing with returns.
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet.The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.
Bought these to give my scissor jacks a more solid platform to rest on.  They are barely large enough to hold a standard 24" scissor jack shoe for a 16 foot travel trailer.  Recommend you consider this when buying.  Had Camco made them literally 4" longer, I'd give them a 5 star review for $15.This tube is probably large enough for 5-10 brake jobs. I used this product when replacing the front rotors and pads on my 1999 Toyota Corolla about 2 weeks ago without any problems.I replace these about every two years or about 60 days of camping.  If you use your RV more thanyou may want to replace it more often.  This one is for a 6 gal tank and we have a 10 gal tank.  We did buy one last year for the 10 but it would not fit.
Armor All tire shine does a great job.  I use it on two vehicles tires, a Malibu and Chev 2500 Pickup.  Lasts a couple of weeks, unless it rains of course.  I get 3 to 4 all tire shines per can.  Recommend!Got these for my 2008 F150, to tow my 27 foot toy hauler and they made a world of a difference, just took some to get use to them and the bar in-between the two mirrors, putting them on only takes seconds!I have an army 6x6, 6 wheel nuts per wheel...each two piece wheel bolted together with 15 nuts at 400 ft/lbs.  A couple wheels had some air leaks, and they need to be disassembled.  It would have been a bear to remove these nuts without the ant-seize.  I use this on every bolt in every application.  Big bolts, little bolts and it does a great job of protecting threads that are exposed to weather.
these are pretty handy when troubleshooting, can free up a hand so you don't have to hold both leads to what ever you are checking.Bought these because the 2x2's I was using were old and splitting.  They work as anyone would expect a plastic pad to put on the ground to stabalize a trailer to do. They're not very tall...because they're flat...so depending on how high your trailer is after you level it with the Camco 44412 RV Wheel Chock you bought (because you need to be level before your stabilized) you may need to put a tree stump or something underneath of this, or buy more of these and stack them.  They seem to interlock rather well.All other jumper cables are not real jumper cables.  THESE are jumper cables.  Let me explain.When you're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead, you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that, it's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables.  It's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan.  Now, according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances, you need thicker cable.That's where these cables come in, they're long at 25' and thick at 2gauge.That's what these cables provide, maximum length at near maximum gauge cable.  And yes, your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that's what you need --- just look up the cost of copper on the market (that stuff is expensive).Yes, you can buy a $17 set of 10 foot, 18 gauge cables out there but if they can't reach between cars or if they can't carry enough power to start your car, you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $17 for all the false confidence it gave you.  I'm serious, buy an extension cord for $5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper' cables on the market --- there should be laws against marketing products that cannot jump start a car.  Worse, having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day, you want a 25' or 20' cable, so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there.  You can go to 6gauge if you're working your way down to 16' cables.  But, the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone's car parked in some tight parking space --- so you're back to the 25' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these (more importantly, I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw)- Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong, but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they're friggin heavy at near 14lbs, yes that's a pro!  that means there's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river (no pun intended). It's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps, it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert.  I don't know if that's a mistake or not.  I'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting.  I'm sure it's more than enough the way it is.Overall, these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up.  He custom made his -- he's old school.Anyway, if you're going to carry jumper cables, and you should --- don't muck around -- spend the dough, get these --- they'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice, after you get a jump don't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home.  There's always time the next day to roll these monsters back up and get them ready for the next wild adventure you might have.
These are a good basic microfiber cloth.  I do not think they are as great as all the reviews claim, but they are good.  I think you can also get the same quality and cheaper at Lowes.  I wish someone would make high-quality clothes.  Until then, these should do the job.Korean made bulbs that may or may not be up to the standards of when they were European produced.However both bulbs worked and have been fine for the past month.  I do not believe these are as bright as the standard Osram European bulbs they replaced though.Microfiber so far is microfiber, they all seem to clean about the same, some leave behind a little less lent than others but for the price these aren't bad.  Now that being said these are smallest microfiber wash-cloths I have ever seen.  Seriously they are the same size as most washcloths, they are tiny! The package makes them seem bigger than they are.
Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.  I typically prefer to go up a size on wipers since it gives a larger clean area.  You can typically go up 2 inches which translates to one inch per side from where the blade attached to the arm.  When the car is dirty, you should be able to see where that extra inch goes - if it hits the top of the trim or other part, you're out of luckWe're using a 28" blade on the drivers side of my wife's Mazda5, and this clears very nicely - no skips or squeaking.  Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.
This item was purchased because my landscape trailer was constantly pulling my harnesses apart, they would drag the street all the time. This is a simple bracket you install on your hitch or bumper that keeps the light harness stationary. I will never again go without this bracket. matter of fact I plan to order a few more so I have them when I upgrade or buy more trucks for my company. I highly recommend this product if you pull any kind of trailer.The reason I am giving the lock three stars is the lock would not work for our trailer hitch. we have a Lance trailer and the hitch was to wide for the lock to fit over. I may grind down the sides of our hitch so I may use it, I will check with Lance first so not to weeken the hitch if for and reason it may then the reese lock is unuseable for my lance trailer and I will pass the lock on to someone who can use it.I haven't used this product much, but I do want to warn people that there is an indentation in the bottom (up front) for this chock to fit on one of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler).  This is good because if the tire is sitting on one of the levelers that this chock is integrated in, the chock won't move.  I suppose that you could still use this chock without one of their levelers, but it won't sit flat on the ground due to that indentation mentioned above.  If your RV doesn't need a leveler, then using this chock may not work as designed.  You may want to consider one of the chocks that doesn't require a leveler to use (Camco 44492 RV Super Wheel Chock).  I'll update this post when I get more experience with them (it comes in a set of two chocks).
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are.I never used these before but I will use them again. they are different than most which have the grooves or ridges on them that line up with grooves in the pullys. These are very quiet and fit perfectly.
Nice brush.  Does what it is made to do and cleanup is easy.  Which the handle was longer so I could get deeper into the drum.Almost nothing to it, mass wise, has an adhesive disc on the back approximately 1.5" across, slightly off-center.  The actual mirror part thought seems to be silvered plastic (no surprise), but arrived with what appears to be scuffing directly from the packaging itself.  As long as there isn't a light source in the reflection, it's barely noticeable, but it's there.The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?

Exact same filter they sell at walmart or an auto parts store.  Save the money and buy online isntead of paying more dollars for local purchase.As good as originals at a good price. Much better quality than some of the knock-offs in the local stores.If you look around in Automotive stores you see these at $49 and some like Autozone give you a mail in rebate for $10 that takes two months to get back if you get a responseThese are the brightest and best light distribution from all the tens of selections of ugly blue, &#34;white&#34;, wobbling filaments and short-lived bulbs.I highly recommend these and at this price I bought 4 sets for the price of two sets and cannot be happier
Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!this is a great product from 3m I would tell any one who is going to do painting this is one tool you should have
This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.I lube my slideout and other seals and gaskets on my motorhome about twice a year.  This works well on the gaskets of the storage compartments.  Be aware that it is really messy to spray on.  You have to open your slides to access the seals, and this comes out of the can similar to engine degreaser - a foam that is messy.  It gets on the painted surfaces and needs to be wiped off promptly. With a straw from another lube can, I can spray it on the top gasket which is almost impossible to reach.  For the side gaskets on the slideout, I find that it is less messy to put on a plastic glove, spray it in my hand, and rub it on.  Works okay that way.  If you are on the road, and your slideout seal is sticking or binding, try baby power. This is an effective product, but Thetford needs to change the nozzle to control the mess.I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose, so I returned it and got this.  A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge "back in the day" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a "dual chuck" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.This tool worked great removing and re installing the oil filter canister on my 2011 Toyota Sienna. It can't get better than thisIt fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine
Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.Fits well into the 7 pin socket and holds the 4 pin socket securely.  Works just like it's supposed to.  Nice adapterFit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute.
Despite all the Reviews and high praise, alost of that comes from advertising and hype remember. Not saying this oil filter is bad, i love it, but it is very expensive for a resin type fiber filter. It will filter well, but not as well as say, glass enchanced nano filters from other brands, especially at this price range. Those other filters may not have as high flow rates, but i do not run a racing dry oil sump system in my car. Some good things about this filter though, it has a thick steel casing and a removal nut, i personally just use my hands to twist off, but for some, the nut can be a real help in taking the filter off. This is a high quality product, do not get me wrong, its just this filter does not fit my situation as well as say, a mobil1 or purolator filter.Ok like most say it gets heavy but most polishers this size and are this weight. Its part of the machine. Whats nice with this is that it comes with rubber backing pad, and a velcro pad as well. It also comes with a real lambs wool pad. So its  price for it all,this is good. I just used it on a big RV project and it did a great job bringing the finish up very nice. It worked over a very large area 4 hours at a time. Well worth the investment. Seems heavy duty, Swich is soild not cheap. The instruction booklet is usless but my common sense figued out how to attach handles and change out different wheels.I would say its probally the best deal on here for the quailty at this cost. Time will tell how long it lasts but they do send and extra set of brushes to have a replacment should they burn out on motor. So thats cool too. Hope to never have to use them.This is an excellent lead set at a VERY good price for the quality of the kit. I have a few sets of leads, and Recently purchased a Extech EX505 CAT IV-600V True RMS Industrial MultiMeter with Waterproof (IP67) and purchased teh kit to accompany it at the same time.  good thing I sis since these leads are a much higher quality than the leads that came with the 505.  The only thing that would make them better is if they were silicone, but the wires are well made, and almost feel like a set of silcone leads I have.I am very pleased with this kit and would recommend it if you don't want to fork out the money for a set like this that is silcone.
I'm using these as DRL, and they are perfect for that use.  Very good quality, great installation gear, and they look nice.  I am going to replace the bulbs with LEDs to cut down on current draw.these seem to be very good quality spreaders. I am going to buy another set to have on hand  in case i need them.While I am very glad I ordered as they are very good and at an excellent price one does need to have &#34;bolts&#34; to attach the one end which (while the picture clearly shows) I did not see.
Works as advertised! Heavy duty construction. Don't know that I care for the bolt that hold it in place would rather use a locking pin as I do with all of my other hitch devices. But that can probably be remedied if I can get out the threaded insert.After using a star lug wrench for many years, I decided to try the Gorilla telescoping power wrench and I am impressed by the additional power that this wrench seems to have.  There is absolutely more torque with this wrench and I am able to remove lug nuts with less effort than the star wrench that I have used for years.The Gorilla wrench can expand to provide additional leverage needed to remove even the most difficult lug nuts attached to your wheels. The telescoping feature snaps into place and I found that in order to reduce it back to it's normal storing size you must depress the recessed spring button and slightly turn the wrench.  You then just simply push the wrench against a hard surface such as the ground in order to collapse the wrench back to it's compact size. Two additional sockets are included as well as a protective plastic case to store your wrench.  The Gorilla wrench is heavy and is of sound construction and I am very pleased with this purchase.This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.
3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter.This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper. Easy to use and sturdy. Is not a eyesore, and seems well made, i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest, it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire, but when the thief see's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel, it won't be so much a snatch and grab. Some piece of mind to myself. I run 31.10.50 x 15&#34; wheels (over $350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $1750), with a Smitybilt tire carrier, the 36&#34; cable was plenty long enough.
I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.

Designed to be light weight, affordable, and reliable. Except that it should only be used in emergency situations. Situations where you walk out of a store to realize your car wont start. This will have enough power to jump start these kind of scenarios. It WILL NOT jump start a car thats been sitting for a month and the battery has been drained to nothing. Its not designed to do that. The light in the front is useless and isnt even LED, BUT it doubles as a cigarette lighter type 12v socket to charge up a phone or whatever. Dont lose the charger, it costs half the price of the actual jump box and is a very non standard voltage.Would give it 5 stars, if it had a more standard 2 prong or 3 prong standard wall outlet plug for charging. but overall. its good to have in the trunk for those just in case moments.It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper.

These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!
Exaclty the same as the OEM filter I dug out of the glove box. This one was the exact same but so much cheaper.This is basically the same as regular sta-bil but with twice the potency...definitely a better buy than the red stuff.This item appears to be the same as what you'd get from the dealer, only at a fraction of the price.  personally, i like the baking soda odor neutralizing ones better, but this is good also.
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.

i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicelyPurchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.

The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was "lost" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O. No explaination was given when I contacted the company. Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance. My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra. The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota's optional "tow package". Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long. The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way. Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal. If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake. If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good..This seems to be one of the better levelers.

Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
Amazon's website says the 15" version of this wiper will fit on a 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  That is not really true.  This wiper was "backwards" what my Cayenne required and I had to spend 15 minutes reversing the rubber to get it to fit the Cayenne.If you have a Porsche Cayenne, try something else.I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.I purchased the JNC300XL for my wife, because she has a habit of leaving some load "on" and drain her battery.  I was attracted to this product because, (1) it was ranked well on amazon, (2) it does have lots a solid reviews, and (3) it was small and not too heavy for my wife.  Before purchasing this product, I was spectacle of the "900 Peak Amp" rating.  I researched all of the internet to try to find any battery specs that comes inside this so-called jump starter.  When it arrived I tried it on a friends sedan.  Connected it up, turned over the car, and nothing.  I took the JNC300XL back home and opened it up to check the battery.  It is an 8ah battery inside. To be frank, I am not a battery expert, but how can a 8ah battery delivery 800 peak amps? I reassembled the JNC300XL and connected it back up it my friends car, and left it connected for several hours (~2-3 hours), and it did eventually work. If you are purchasing this as a jumper starter for emergency situations, I think you will be disappointed.  If you just need something to boost your battery, and time is not an issue, it works just fine.  I just think the product description is misleading.  It should say battery booster, not jump starter.
A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara. Simple install. Does what it is suppose to do.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.
This did not do much for perfomance...the original plug works much better.  I use this plug now as a back up.It is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy againbought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed.
If you simply follow the directions this is the best thing you can get to seal your gaskets.Just what it is - brass drain plug.  Normal quality as you would buy in a hardware store if you could find this configuration for this specific purpose.This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.First of all, the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second, once the car is started, you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display, indicating that a charge is occurring. However, this is a static icon, it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom. And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery. For this you need accurate readings, and I can not see these on this unit.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.If you need extra room for storing this, then is perfect for you; ball sizes range from 1 7/8 to 2 1/2" and change very easily with little effort.  This model requires a slight turn of the center pin to lock/unlock the ball for changing and you need to remember to re-lock it after attachment.7 Prong connector is the best for use in any towing situation even if you only need a flat 4 lead connection.  This unit is well used on rigs where you may run into many towed vehicle applications that do not match the 7 pole set up.  4 pole is at the ready if you need it.
I gave a five star rating because of past expierence using this product.The first California car duster I had recieved as a gift  lasted 15 yrs.I bought a new one 5 yrs ago its still doing a good job and use that for my work truck.t I wanted to buy  one for my wife's vehicle..I like the wooden handle FYI follow instructions about putting it on a newpaper for 48 hrs.It will show some streaks the few times of use.They have to get broken in and it does a great job.I highly recommend this product.I used this on a 1993 Lexus with 135,000 miles.It had problems shifting into over drive with a 4 speed auto transmission.In less than 100 miles after replacing 3 qt`s transmission fluid and 8 oz`s Lubeguard (1 oz.for every qt your transmission holds) it shifts smoothly once again.I have a 2012 tundra and the mpgs were lower than the day i bought it. So i gave it a shot of this stuff and man it works. I bought a gallon at the recommendation of a friend who uses this stuff it will last me a year sin e i have two cars. You can use this with every fill up. The engine idles like knew and the mps increase by one mile. Thats an extra 25 miles to a tank.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderCan't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.

Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.changed engine oil on my equinox. just make sure it will work on your type of car. other wise it will give you pain like one of my friends. when it works, it is super cool. not a single drop of oil on the floor.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).
I know that nothing is theft proof. All we can do is make it as inconvenient for the thief as possible, so maybe he will move on to an easier target.This lock would not be easily opened with hand tools... a torch or grinder would probably be required, making the attempted theft a bit obvious from the showers of sparks.The round style keys are much harder to pick than a traditional tumbler method.So far, I haven't found any faults with this device... but I will update later in the summer when it has had some use.Can't comment much on these since they have not yet been used (I will come back and update my review is I find any issues after first use) ... but they are built solid, nice tough big hard clamps and love having a long cable so I never have to move cars around or anything if needed. I bought these to have in my new truck since you always need cables ... but another reason is for when I tow my travel trailer and we run the batteries with no shore power they may die after a couple days ... if you are in need a quick small recharge they are the perfect length to pop my hood, run the cables to the back of the truck and hook up to the batteries that are on the tongue of my travel trailer ... running the truck for 30-45 minutes with this nice large gauge wire connected from my battery tot he trailer battery will give me a bit of a charge if ever in a pinch and I have no shore power, solar, or generator to recharge.Bought the bucket boss 06009 jumper cable bag and it fit this 25 footer Perfectly!!!It has no use and is a waste of money right now ... but will EASILY pay for itself the first time you need it ... always be prepared! :)This tool is designed to get behind the lip of a dynamic oil seal, without having to remove the shaft, or disassemble an entire gearbox to be able to drive it out from behind.  It works, by having a thin 'hook' that you can work under the lip of the seal, and then you use the handle to 'lever' it out.As a labor saving device, it works pretty well.However, the hook has to be thin enough, to be able to wiggle between the seal lip, and the shaft, and being that thin, it isn't terribly strong.  There is a reason, a spare hook comes with the tool.I would not classify this, as my tool of choice for seal removal, so much as a special use tool, that you pull out to turn a 2 hour R&R; job, into a 15 minute one, and for that it works well.  The hook is just too delicate for continual use, and will break sooner or later.  I have not priced replacement hooks yet, I still have one good one.  Maybe if they were super cheap, I would rate it 4 stars.  As it is, I have trouble rating it over 3 stars, when I broke the hook on the 3rd or 4th seal I tried it on.  To be fair, I just tried 'levering' it out, and maybe if I was being a little more careful, it might not have happened.
Pros:Generous supply in 32 oz bottleWorks in fuel or mixed with engine oilSmells pleasant (minty, clean)Keeps cold engine start-ups slick and quickCons:Thin lubricantThins out your oilIt is a solvent, it MIGHT (no facts to support that possibility yet) deteriorateyour gaskets, seals.Claims:Cleans out engine, plugs, valves, and injectorsMY recommended use:8 - 10 oz per oil change(they recommend 20% mmo with engine oil change. That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.
I purchased this for a small RV modification. My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.  I have used these before for water hoses, and though it says &#34;electric cable hatch&#34; it will work fine for a standard RV freshwater hose too.I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chockedBought these for my Vette.  The length of the ramp is not sufficient to get the car on and off without using wood extensions.  Getting on is OK, but getting off without the wood slipping and crashing the bumper is a real trick.  Have to bore a small hole in the wood and a small hole in the ramp to "lock the wood extension into place" to avoid slippage.Other than that, they work.
This dogbone lock is very nice and well buildt. It is perfect for use on any car or truck if you are going to remove it after each use. But it is not for use on a motorhome reciver, were it is going to be left on for some time.The problem is ! The protective rubber cap that covers the key entry, fits loosely. The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot. Any little bump in the road, and off it comes !  Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism, the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch.I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...It worked perfectly to remove the spark plugs. the grip part is left visible when inserted in the spark plug hole, so, you can continue removing or adjusting the spark plug with hand. good tool, right size.
Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.  When we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash 360 degrees and the car is parked perfect.  Our garage is a 3 car one, but with my car, motor cycle, large mower, tools, tool chest, garbage cans, lawn equipment, wall cabinets,  etc....we need to make sure we manage the space.  And now we have more space.so I got sick and tired of getting hit in the head with the gate, especially on cold days. these were very easy to install (thanks to a dewalt impact driver). it does take some effort to close the door now, but I'm happy because I won't get hit in the head or walk into the gate anymoreThis works well so I can keep my unit inside the garage yet hook up my vehicle when there is no room to park it inside . I have to batteries in a camper van . I used to have to crawl under and hook it up in winter meaning it didn't always get done . With the proper disconnects attached it is no longer a difficult thing to do . Just make sure the leads can't rub on anything .
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.What I really like about these is the locking bar.  Most inexpensive stands do not have the add safety feature of a locking bar.  These are quality items that make me feel very safe working under a carA number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guessbecause, I have not used these yet.  I know they will be quite wonderful when I do need to use themI use this item. I use alot of Meguiar's products for my detailing. You don't need alot to make it happen,  SW
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellYou never know when you might need a first aid kit for your car. I just never knew what kinds of things I should have in it. After buying this, I feel like I could make my own first aid kits for auto in the future. It's so much cheaper to do it that way.Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.
Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these coversWhat canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.
Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date.Bought a new weight distribution hitch that came equipped with a 2&#34; ball ... I needed a 2-5/16&#34; ball for my larger travel trailer but wanted one with the larger big beefy 1-1/4&#34; shank ... my WD hitch had a hole for that size and NO WAY would I go buy a 2-5/16&#34; ball with a smaller diameter shank and use a spacer in it!I want to best thickest built ball and shank and I could not find a ball this size with this larger shank here locally.Price was great and I love having a big bad boy ball and shank to pull the 5-6K load of my trailer.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.
I've had this buddy with me in all my roadtrips and I need no other tire gauge with me. I use this on snow/sand trails with me even though my compressor has its own built in gauge, I still use this for a second reading. I wish they had 1 psi increments though.I presently use this in a 2007 Dodge Nitro SXT (56,000 miles) and a 2005 Yamaha Royal Star motorcycle (shaft drive, 88,000 miles) which are both frequently operated far from population centers. I've also used this in my previous Dakota pickup truck and my Mustang hardtop, total mileage on all vehicles in excess of 500,000 miles (206,000 on the Mustang, 166,000 on the Dakota) and no problems experienced with any of them. I consider it cheap "insurance" for vehicles I depend upon to get me wherever I need to be.These tools paid for them selves with the first use. Good quality but stick to cars and small trucks or you might have problems. Wish I had them when I rebuilt the front end of my Chevy S-10. I will never touch a pickel fork again!

a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it.What else do you need to say?  It's a grit guard for the 2 bucket method.  Cheap and it fits well.I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair.
I agree that these should come on the Jeep instead of having to pay extra for them, but with that said, installation was easy and they look good.  Overall I'd buy them again.Again, these guys are hard to do without.  They are doing the job!  I don't buy the 3-pack, I prefer to buy the individuals in quantities of 3 because, for some reason, I get free shipping on the individual ones, but not on the multi pack one.  So, it came out cheaper to buy them a la carte.  Go Figure!these seem to be very good quality spreaders. I am going to buy another set to have on hand  in case i need them.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Tight fit that is snug. A bottom fist strike seats cap. We will see soon how it handles a road trip.

I use this on snow/sand trails with me even though my compressor has its own built in gauge, I still use this for a second reading. I wish they had 1 psi increments though.I presently use this in a 2007 Dodge Nitro SXT (56,000 miles) and a 2005 Yamaha Royal Star motorcycle (shaft drive, 88,000 miles) which are both frequently operated far from population centers. I've also used this in my previous Dakota pickup truck and my Mustang hardtop, total mileage on all vehicles in excess of 500,000 miles (206,000 on the Mustang, 166,000 on the Dakota) and no problems experienced with any of them. I consider it cheap "insurance" for vehicles I depend upon to get me wherever I need to be.These tools paid for them selves with the first use. Good quality but stick to cars and small trucks or you might have problems. Wish I had them when I rebuilt the front end of my Chevy S-10. I will never touch a pickel fork again!
Dynamat is great, it's the original, you can't go wrong. I'm strictly using for door panels on both vehicles as I upgrade their stereo systems completely.  But I plan to put this on the floor of my truck as well, under the carpet.I use this on my new Vette and have zero flaws in use and how it shows up on the finish!  Just bought a new RAM and it does the same.  Great product!I bought this tool on a whim, since it's fairly cheap, preparing to replace the rear brake pads on my 2003 Beetle 1.8t.  None of the sides had the correct spacing to retract the caliper piston.  I rented a kit from an auto parts store beforehand to be safe and needed it in the end.That said, I am going to keep this tool for future cars.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.

Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderIt fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.
Recommended for use in all hybrid vehicles. You can extend the oil change out to past 10K miles with no effects. If you have a GenII Prius (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, or 2009) you should also buy the Purolator PL20195 PureONE Oil Filter (also available on Amazon). This is a bigger filter than the stock one, but if you are pushing out your oil changes, a bigger filter is cheap insurance.Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.
While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size.These work just fine and provide a good smooth surafce for jacks or landing gear. Since mine are new I can't comment on durability. They fit perfectly with other Links products.Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.

I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckbought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanksCan't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youI have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.This fits perfectly onto my Scion 2006 XB. Cheap. Just did an oil and filter change. I would buy this again and reccomend this item.Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well, no issues. Would purchase again.

What can I say? It does what it says and I like the weight of it...makes it feel solid. I also like the LED light they put in so you can take the pressure in the dark/dim light.Installed in a 2007 Camry Hybrid.  However, when I close the lid, I do see a bit of the white cover on the left but Fram says this is the correct part.  Did not notice any improvements in performance, but cheaper than OEM.This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.  I'm using it for that occasionally, but I'm a little worried about it...
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!This is a great price for a replacement cabin air filter for my 2005 Toyota Corolla. It works fine and is easy to install (especially if you've done it before).Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!

it's a depth gauge. not much to it- it does the job so you can better measure how much tire tread you have left. handy when you're looking to replace a tire and debating on whether or not you need to replace two tire, or have the new one shaved down.  a handy little tool.When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it...If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me.
Great hydraulic oil. Quality comes in an entire package. This includes the container, the pouring spout and the way the spout can be retracted with the cap on for storage. One can is enough to flush and refill the entire power steering unit.j After changing the fluid, my power steering is noticeable smoother and quieter. Very pleased with the performance of the product.Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.Well, to start, the only thing that I will complain about is the reservoir jar.It's not well made (may leak air), and doesn't hold that much liquid.I ended up building my own with a mason jar and two nozzles from a local hardware store.Other than the jar, I'm very happy with the kit, especially the the pump.The pump is well made, solid construction with all metal.  The gauge is movable.It has two settings, pump or suction.I used the kit on the following projects the past year:1.. Oil change on mower.Experience: Worked great.2.. Oil Change on Generator.Experience: Worked great.3.. Brake fluid change.Experience: not so great.  No fault to the pump or the kit setup.When using suction with brake fluid change, the fluid doesn't come out in a nice uniform motion where I can examine the bubbles, for example.  The fluid comes out in the tube with a roller coaster fashion (can't see anything.)I think next time I'll go back to the 2-man setup.If anyone has a recommendation on this please let me know.Overall, a great kit (great pump), and would recommend to others.
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.i bought this to replace worn out pins and springs on my 20 year old Hi Lift Jack... Jack is still in good working order and will use the fix it kit, as a back up!
This works much better than any dinky siphon pump they sell on this site and at auto zone.This makes changing rear differential fluid much easier!  If you don't have a drain plug or the cover does not remove you can suck out the old then add new using this unit too.If your transmission does not have a drain plug and you want to change whats in the pan you can suck out from the dipstick tube and add new.This tool has come in handy many times and has not developed any leaks.Works excellent! Get the Aerosol over the liquid if you have the pod style filter or flat corrugated style for sure. It spays nice and even. I have used them both, the spray, and the liquid and the spray is the way to go for these. If you do have the older all foam style filters then get the liquid (squirt/pour kit or bottle) it will last you longer.Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.

works wellIt fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engineCan't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus.My 2003 Silverado 1500 5.3 V* owners manual called for a GF626.....This is the EXACT same fit and goes on  easy. Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid...This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
THESE ARE GREAT MICROFIBER TOWELS. THEY WORK GREAT.  JUST DON'T DRY IN DRYER. HANG DRY AND THEY WORK GREAT.  POLISH,CLEAN ANYTHING WITHOUT SCRATCHING.  I BOUGHT TWO OF THE 36 TOWEL PACKAGES AS I USE THEM FOR EVERYTHING. THANKSI WAX THE CAR/MOTORCYCLES ALL THE TIME AND I RATE THIS LIQUID WAX HIGHER THAN MEGUIAR'S THAT I HAVE USED FOR YEARS.  YOU WILL LIKE HOW IT GOES ON AND BUFFS/SHINES UP SO EASILY.  GREAT FRAGRANCE TOO.REPLACE WATER PUMP SO I DECIDED TO REPLACE THE BELTS TOO ....PERFECT FIT FOR 5.3L 2002 ESCALDE.....NO SQUEAKING AT ALL IN THE MORNINGS....
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLRated the best &#34;value&#34; filter on the market by independent testers that tested each filter on the market by using them and then cutting the filters open to see how they held up under actual use.  They then rated the filters on how well they fared and also how well they were made.Actually I like the price best. These are usually way over priced. Here they'e just expensive. They do the job and in a year I'll let you know how they hold up.
put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions.what a great replacement for those awful plastic plugs which are so difficult to put in and take out.  Supposedly they also extend the life of the water heater.I kind of wish they just sold the filter and O-ring together, instead of also with the cap, but what are ya gonna do? Worked as expected.
I qualify 5 stars because it would be unfair to give a bad reputation, I purchased this product on September 27, I Bought 2 Armor extreme shine, I live in South America so I need an address where my purchases must arrived in the united States and then send to my country. My courier company said that they couldn&#8217;t transport Aerosol or contents under pressure because is a dangerous goods. I had to declare the product as abandoned, I lost my purchase. I will not be able to watch my shiny wheels, I'm sad about that, but I'm sure it's an excellent product because I have purchased other products of &#8220;Armor all&#8221; that are not dangerous goods and arrived without problems to my country where I check the good quality of their products.I bought this for my new car and my vintage car.  I don't like to use water on my old car.  This product works.  Like all products read the instructions before using.  Many reviewers write before they read the instructions.  I will buy again.I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!!

I would not have believed it if I didn't try it for myself. The Onan generator on my toy hauler would not start and I tried new gas, but the lights would blink that the generator needed service and would not stay running. I poured a little more than the recommended dose in the tank and kept starting the generator. After I felt I got some of the fuel into the generator carb I left it overnight. When I came out the next morning and started it the generator fired up, blew out some white smoke and ran like a champ. I let it run for an hour under full load of the A/C. The generator fires up every time now and runs great.I spent several weeks trying to decide if i wanted to invest in a brake controller for our new-to-us travel trailer. Since i grew up on a farm, trailers are nothing new to me but brake controllers are. I am pulling a 26' bumper-to-bumper trailer with a 2006 Yukon Denali XL and the 400 miles that I have pulled it have been without issue. However, there was one time that I wished that I had more stopping power and the trailer seemed like a load for the Yukon's brakes,so I started researching brake controllers. First I looked at a middle of the road option from Wal-Mart, but then I ran across this one for $40 more. Somewhere in the reviews a person mentions the cost of not having one, and he/she could not be more right. $20,000.00 SUV, $4,000.00 trailer (weekend warriors), and my priceless family and family pets....and I had to think for two weeks about spending $100.00???I ordered the brake controller and the proper wiring harness from Amazon and had it in two days thanks to my prime membership. With the $10 wiring harness for the Yukon, I was able to install the controller in 20 minutes...no joke. No splicing...no fuse manipulation..no electrical tape...just plug-n-play. Also to my surprise the Yukon had two pre-drilled holes in metal directly under the steering column that fit the brake controller mounting bracket perfectly. Now for a test run.I hooked the trailer up and the controller immediately detected it so I took off slowly down my driveway. While I did look at the brakes when I purchased the trailer (I am pretty sure the previous owner never used them), I had no way of testing the overall system so my first test was to see if the trailer brake system actually worked. It did. In fact, the boost was set on 2 and the wheels locked up with little effort. I tried no boost and then settled on boost 1. I can see where the options of no boost, boost 1, and boost 2 will be nice when going through the mountains.Anyhow, the final test, I took off down the road and not 3 miles from house some yahoo decided to pass me on a two lane road at the crest of a hill and forced me into a situation where I had to put the brakes to the floor. In that instant the trailer brakes locked and stopped the Yukon, not the other way around, and every ounce of buyers remorse was gone just as quickly.Give yourself some piece of mind while saving the brakes on your towing rig. Buy it and grab a wiring harness while you are at it.I wound up spending $200 or more replacing my Vent Valve Solenoid, purge valve and Evap Canister because I was sold a defective AcDelco GT276 gas cap. I got the dreaded p0400 code and learned the first thing to check is the gas cap. Bought the Delco brand because of the tassle and hoped that it would be the same as the oem cap. Well, it's not!After replacing the gas cap and getting the same code a couple weeks later, I began to try and troubleshoot the EVAP system and quickly learned that it is a booger...After spending the time and money to replace the above mentioned parts and continuing to get the SES light and monitoring results thru my system/code reader, I turned my focus back to the Gas Cap. I had noticed that the tension on the cap before it began to click wasn't even as strong as the old oem cap I had replaced. At my wits end , I decided to go ahead and purchase the STANT brand gas cap and give it a shot. I read some good reviews about Stant. The new cap arrived and the tension and fit on it was 10 times better than this cap. After replacing with the Stant cap, I monitored the cars system and it PASSED the EVAP check. At that time I felt relieved that I found my problem, but I was also peeved that I had spent $200 on other parts because of this defective cap. So I would advise anybody out there to buy a Stant instead..... Oh, and the Delco is made in Germany
Installed these on a 1999 Jeep XJ Cherokee in about 20 mins start to finish and they work as well or better than the factory lifts that came on the Jeep.Same part number fits both right and left sides, you simply have to flip the upper bracket over on one of them with your finger to have it fit the other side.I will certainly buy this brand again when needed.Standard shipping was very fast and product was delivered in perfect condition.Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.I have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade, and this is my fourth cover purchase.  They are fantastic quality and fit for the price!Storage indoors, and the cover will easily last 5+ years if you're careful not to snag it, as it will tear easily on sharp corners (mirrors, license-plates, etc.).  For the first 5-6 years of my bike's life, it was stored indoors, and one cover lasted easily during that period... where I live now, I don't have that luxury (yet).Outdoors, this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful UV damage for at least two seasons (mine started to fall apart after 3-years of year-round, outdoor coverage, but I also coat it annually with Camp-Dry to increase water repellent ability and UV protection).  The elastic does start to give out after a couple of years, but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds.Sizing:For sizing, The XL fits perfectly (slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn-signals) over my 1100cc Honda Sabre with 19" windshield, large saddle-bags, and small tour-pack behind sissy-bar.  This XL fits exactly the same as the XL made 10 years ago, with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals... I'd be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there.If I had to buy again, it would be a toss-up as to the XL or XXL.  My last one was an XXL and it was very loose-fitting, which caused it to flap in the wind, catch wind under it, and sagged in heavy rain, which created places where water would "pocket" on top or droop to the seat-level, eventually soaking through the material.  The XXL also covered (almost) all the way to the ground, which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes/engine touching the black material (not the heat-resistant silver).Design Change:The newest version of this cover also does not have silver running 360-degrees around the cover, as in the picture.  The black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel, and the silver starts right behind the forks.  This does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting, and actually looks much better when on the bike.Cons:My only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more "nylon-feel" than "cloth-feel" of the ones made 10 years ago (or even five years ago), and the cover does not have the full Nelson-Rigg logo... missing "More than just a Bike" wording below the logo... no biggie, but having the full logo does make it easier to find the "front" of the cover in the dark :)  I do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least, as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months, and still looks like NEW.  We'll have to see about longevity... but if it lasts 2-3 years in outdoor conditions, I'll not be complaining!Update 6-8-14:When putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain, the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors.  The rip was not bad, but very disappointing to spend $40 on a cover that has barely held up to 6-months of use and very mild weather!  I will be contacting Nelson Rigg to obtain a replacement under warranty!
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.Just like the rest of the reviews, this thing fits perfectly in the Wrangler windshield. It's small, rolls up out of the way but it is pricey - but all the custom fit ones are - what r u going to do.
This is a great product. Has special coating on filter to prevent mold from developing on it. Keeps in car air clean and prevents it from smelling bad.I used this to wrap the ehaust system on my 2004 Yamaha R6. Went on good and looks good against the black frame. Also keeps the heat down from buring the track plastics!Easy to use. Keeps my trailer hitch safe and secure.Has a cover over the key hole to protect from rain and dirt.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.

I just ordered a custom painted front plate for my truck and wanted to protect it from dirt and fading. This cover fits the bill just right. Easy install over the plate and clear view is not a problem. I highly recommend this product.I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well .
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.These are a whole lot better than my stock nozzle. Will spray a fan of fluid, it is adjustable and comes with the adjuster key, silver thing in the picture.The only thing I wish was different was being able to adjust the spray higher than what the limit is at now. It is just barely clearing the whipper blade, but the stock one had been so clogged that is wasn't getting above it at all.It is on a ball type adjustment, so all angles and such, just the angle of my hood is the issue, overall, way better and even spread.I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.

changed engine oil on my equinox. just make sure it will work on your type of car. other wise it will give you pain like one of my friends. when it works, it is super cool. not a single drop of oil on the floor.Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though.This wax goes on easy but you will get a work out taking it off but that will pay off, this wax will last for a while. I have applied it several months ago and the water still beeds up like I waxed it last week.  I used a electric buffer to take it off that will make it easier on you.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.They don't. I waited too long to try them so I can't return. The model optimizer clearly said this is what I should order. They are not sized properly. I've bought Bosch before too.They fit perfect, they do exactly what they are supposed to do, and I got them for a great price. What beats that?
While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.This item appears to be the same as what you'd get from the dealer, only at a fraction of the price.  personally, i like the baking soda odor neutralizing ones better, but this is good also.
Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.This unit has made cleaning and dumping of the holding tanks work almost to perfection. See my comments on the camco 39847 45 degree swivel fitting.
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost.This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.Needed a good tester for ignition systems on most cars and trucks now days. nothing worse than having a cheap tester and not knowing whether the tester is good or not.  Plus the old put a sparkplug on the wire and try grounding it with the high voltage is not fun any more.  worth the money for a quick use tester.
easy to install and works great a good product and great price. very simple to use and clean looking like it came from the factory on my truckThing works great and is very easy to install. All RV's should have this on the black & grey tanks.I bought this to use on the electrical system in my car. It works very well and appears to be very accurate. Shipping was very quick and using it is fairly straight forward. If you can read and follow directions you will enjoy this item.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!works fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.
The first time I used it to inflate the tires on my garden cart to 35PSI it blew the 15A fuse for my car's cigarette lighter circuit. This also comes with its own 15A fuse as extra protection, but my car's fuse went first.I'm upgrading to model 90P instead which comes with alligator clips that go straight onto the car battery terminals. It starts to slow down when it gets beyond 35PSI so I would NOT consider this "heavy duty" at all, but for most light weight purposes it does the job. This is a cute and small pump.Tip: if you do decide to go with the 70P there are a couple things you can do to decrease the chance of blowing the fuse. 1. turn on the pump before connecting to the tire, and 2. run the engine since the alternator will increase the voltage thereby reducing the amp draw.Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended.This sewer hose support compresses to about one foot or will stretch out to match the length of a fifteen or twenty-foot hose. A convenient plastic carrying handle holds the assembly together for easy transport and storage. Using this support to keep the sewer hose off the ground can provide a smooth slope from the RV to the campsite sewer connection to ensure a continuous, efficient flow of the effluent without pooling that could freeze in cold weather and cause backups.  Raising your sewer hose with this assembly also makes it less likely that someone will step on it.  It's made of lightweight plastic which, if handled roughly, will snap.  But with reasonable care it should provide many years of useful service.
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows.
Working well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
Bought for my new Corvette.  Chevy sells a similar (if not the same0 product for a much higher price.  The CTEK web site shows this unit brand labeled for BMW, Audi, Maserati and Lamborghini so it may well be the unit Chevy buys brand labeled.It has a 4 mode charging system.  The last is a pulsed maintenance mode so it can be kept on all the time for when the car will not be used for several weeks.  Well-made and comes with a bag to hold it and the accessories, that I put on a pegboard hook in the garage.I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.With this 25 ft extension I can leave the Battery Tender inside the garageand close the door so it's not out in the weather ~nor any concern about the BT coming up missing,and reach my truck battery in the driveway to be sure it starts in the winter.We also keep a car in our one car garage, that is hardy ever driven,so periodically I connect the Batter Tender to the car to maintain that battery too.And the Battery Tender works equally well, with or with-out the 25 ft ex.The total potential lenght combining this cable, with the BT cords are about 38 ft.if continued in a straight line.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord  74" long ~Cable that clips to a battery 84" long ~ totaling over 13 ft.For me the BT extension cable is perfect.I leave my car hooked up for several days ~then add the 25 ft ex and clip to the truck.This extension cable is of good qualityand adds to the versatility of the BT Plus.
It is simple, it is a hitch lock that locks. If that is what you want then this is what you are looking for. I like it, i keep my hitch on 24/7/365 now and never worry it might get jacked!Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.This is a nice steering wheel cover.  I'm not completely sure its leather but it feels nice.  I read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather.  I'm going to say this.  If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $20 for a product.  For that price you get what you get,  regardless of what the manufacturer may claim. Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant.  A nice cover it is.  Top grain leather it is not, at least not for $20. Want top quality?  Spend multiples of the cost of this product! !!! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap.

To me? Grabage... the quality of this set has gone downhill IMO... I have an older set that rocks so I bought this newer set for another trailer - garbage.  Mismatched looking pins and locks. Hitch cover lock is plactic and doesnt hold well. I would recommend buying local so that you can try it and return it... Thank you AMAZON for allowing me to return this POG.Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellThese will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?
Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems.The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.Very nice sturdy chock with a convenient synthetic leash.  Looks just like the one pictured.  I purchased two.  The price is for one each.  The size is just right for compact vehicles such as a Ford Ranger or other small Truck or Car with Stock Tires.
Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.installed the unit in an BMW e46 320D Wagon and the unit works ok... but sometimes you get that wiper switch slap you dont with other brands.... install Valeo brand instead if you can..!What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.
These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.Pros:-Helps you get your wheels off.  Then you can fix your own brakes, paint your calipers, or swap wheels!-Has 4 wrench sizes, which work for both metric and SAE lug nuts.-14&#34; provides adequate leverage for easy removal and installation of lug nuts.-Inexpensive!Cons:-Doesn't remove lug nuts for you.-Doesn't put your lug nuts back for you.The only way to make this wrench better would be to make it much longer (20&#34; or something), or to include a mechanic to do all the work for you (expensive).
I HAVEN'T SEE ANY IMPROVE IN MILES, MOTOR SOUND LOOK THE SAME AS BEFORE USING THIS OIL; MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN COULD SEE SOMETHING, SO FAR IS THE SAME AS CONVENTIONAL .PRICE ON AMAZON, E-BAY AND PARTS STORE LIKE : AUTOZONE,O'REALLY, NAPA ARE TOO HIGH, $ 36 +,  SO GO TO WAL-MART THEY HAVE IT FOR $ 24 TO 25 A GALLON OF 5 Q.BOUGHT THIS FOR A REPLACEMENT TO THE OLD WHITE TANK COVER ON MY 31' COUGAR CAMPER. GREAT COLOR BUT NOT BRONZE, MORE OF A MEDIUM BROWN. I LIKE THE ACCESS ON TOP FOR THE VALVES. THE ONLY REASON FOR 4 STARS IS THE FACT THAT IT IS A 2 PIECE BOLT TOGETHER DESIGN. WOULD HAVE RATHER IT BEEN ALL 1 MOLDED PIECE FOR FIT AND FINISH.GIVES YOU THAT EXTRA 5 FEET YOU NEED  GREAT...CAN SET MY LAPTOP ON MY BENCH INSTED OF BENDING OVER IN CAR WITH A BAD BACK.
Looks great, easy install, will help back passengers when top is down, since there is nothing to hold on too, low profile, does not get in the way of view. (Jeep Wrangler 2013 2 door)The flat surface perpendicular to the valve axis is what makes this gauge especially easy to use.  It allows your thumb to easily push down while the main grip remains firmly in your hand. Moreover, the readout is very easy to see.  Combining both elements, the Accutire is an excellent product to use in low light environments or when the the weather is poor.Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations, this is it. If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it. Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt. Its going to shine. Great automotive or household maintenance product.
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.Bought this to use on my 08 4Runner. Converts the factory socket into a 4 prong flat connector to use with most common uHaul trailer wiring. Works great, seems well made. Only gripe is that it doesn't seem to fit with a reassuring snap or click or anything of that sort. You push it in and have to sort of guess if you got it right.
Removing spark plugs from the Ford Modular V8's can be exceedingly frustrating; especially if you snap a plug in half while trying to remove it. The diameter of this tool steadies your approach down into the depths of the head and prevents you from leaning your tool sideways; thereby making in easier to remove the plug in one piece.Bought for an APO address and free shipping, couldn't beat it. When you twist off the bottle cap the remaining ring easily falls off, so be careful if you pour directly into your oil reservoir, don't want the plastic ring falling in with the oil. But use a funnel and you won't have the problem. Will buy again.Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.
I like that you can shut off the flow out the funnel.  This is handy because if you know the amount of oil needed, say 20 ounces in your lawn mower, you can measure 20 ounces by the markings on the funnel, open the valve with a quick twist, and watch it go in.  It even has a little screen at the outlet to keep any debris that might get in there, from getting into your engine.A lid for the top, and a cap on the end of the hose, keeps the dust out when not in use.  The flex tube going down is easily flexed, but can kink if bent too sharply.  That is OK, though, because a tube that would be harder to kink would likely not be as flexible, or as transparent....oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now.The Key Vault appears to be well made, with very little plastic.  Being concerned about rust (which may or may not be a problem), I put a little bit of Teflon oil on the inside of the two sliding retainers that hold the two pins in, as well as a drop on the two latch points before installing.  This way, if it does get some rust, it will have less of a chance of seizing up.  Long term instead of oil, I'd probably recommend a small amount of Teflon based grease where the pin contacts the two sliders, as well as on where the sliders contact the inner wall.  Since the drawer walls are high, the oil isn't going to come into contact with the contents.  I'd probably consider a drop of oil on the spring in the back that pushes the drawer out when the right combination is entered and the lever pulled.I easily changed the combination and had no problems whatsoever installing it.  Time will tell if it gets water into the drawer, but so far, it looks decently water resistant.  I personally am not worried about water getting in the drawer.As for people being able to tell it is there, the only real way someone can find it is if they examine the hitch pins and notice that it isn't a standard hitch lock, or pull off the dust cover.If someone had to place a spare key on a vehicle, this is the most secure solution for this answer.  Of course, a thief who has some power tools can get into it, as well as someone sitting there flipping through 10,000 combinations.If someone is worried that keeping a spare key in this would be a security issue, you can do the following which an acquaintance of mine does:  Keep a "dummy" key in the Hitch Safe that will open the door.  Then inside the vehicle, use a console or other strongbox with a stout lock store in there a spare key that works in the ignition.  This way, for a thief to steal the vehicle, they would have to either break out the Hitch Safe, then try drilling out a heavy steel enclosure for the ignition key, or break the windows and try to get into the console safe.  Either way, eventually a thief would prevail, but it will take a lot of time and noise.  For all but the most crime-plagued areas, the Hitch Safe appears good enough -- it keeps all but the dedicated thieves with hand/power tools away.
I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi DevilleI haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.
The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.The small size of this drainer is perfect for any camper.  The little cut-out on the bottom fits over the edge of the sink.Bought this to fill gear oil for Manual transmission in my Hyundai Elantra. The fill port on the elantra trans is on the fron of the housing and there actually is about 3-4 inches of clearence. The fill tube fit nicely in the hole for the transmission and filling was pretty effortless. My only gripes is as I was filling there was a constant drip from the fill hole and the hose bends easily. So not only is filling slowed down but I lost probably about 1/4 quart of oil down the front of the transmission.
The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.Fits perfectly, will not slip and 3/4 the price in an RV accessory store (same Thing).  Cleans off in a Jiffy
This is my second time purchasing this for my Acura RL. I am 100% not sure about the pollen crap, but I am certain the weird smell is gone.I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel.  The kit was perfect and the tools were decent.  My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made.  Global economy or whatever, when I'm looking for quality tools, I'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices.  Sure, these are better than Harbor Freight, but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.But that is a rant to have another day, and I can point you towards a better kit for now.  So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA.I agree with the other reviewers who state the unit is ugly.  the welds are bulky and uneven.  However, the welds seem stout and I am sure it will perform just fine.  After all, this is about as low-tech as you can get.  I will disagree with other reviewers who say the unit does not move/sway.  I have a 5/8&#34; pin in it and my bike rack moves pretty substantially.  I will be getting an adapter to remedy this problem.  Bottom line for me for this product was price.  I am overall pleased with Curt and this product.
I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks.I kind of wish they just sold the filter and O-ring together, instead of also with the cap, but what are ya gonna do? Worked as expected.I've used Bosch wipers before after learning about them from a commercial during the Storm Chasers series on TV where they chase down storms. I figured they are good enough for people chasing tornadoes I would give them a shot. I've gone through a few pairs of these and never am disappointed. They do a phenomenal job of clearing the rain off of the window and are built well to last longer then typical blades I used to get from the big box stores that were cheaper. Now I will say you can buy a typical set of blades for about half the cost of a pair of these since these are sold in single packs, but the quality really makes a difference with these. I will add, I am also a member of the SKYWARN Storm Spotter community and also use these (different model) on my truck when I'm out hunting down storms.The people complaining about size on here I'm not sure if they choose the wrong model for their vehicle but in my experience as long as you choose the right vehicle it will tell you exactly what you need. In my case it went from year down to trim style and picked the exact blades I've bought before, so make sure you choose exactly the right details and you shouldn't have any issues getting the right size.
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!
i neede this for my duramax tailgat, it fit nicely and looks original.  easy to install and stays where it's supposed tothis detailer is very easy to use and works well when you clay your car , it makes the clay slide easy and also cleans up quick so you can get to the waxingYou'd be hard pressed to find this product to be not functional.  It is fused and connects right to the battery.  All in all it works like it should and it is easy to install.
this detailer is very easy to use and works well when you clay your car , it makes the clay slide easy and also cleans up quick so you can get to the waxingexcellent grease gun! easy to load, easy to use and the longer hose is great!I love this thing - it was easy to put together holds me just fine... And is easy to scoot around on.  Great price nice creeper.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicelyThis is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...
My Harley has a lot if black on the motor. It's a 2003 and very gradually the black will loose it's rich dark look. This product really brought back that dark rich look. I recommend it.to those who wish to know the truth regarding PIAA light bulbs.the PIAA light bulbs are no better than stock light bulbs.i purchased my 2004 toyota corolla brand new. the stock lights burned out in the year 2011.do the math, seven years without a stock light burn out.stock lights are just as good or better than the overpriced PIAA light bulbs.PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin PackMade my steering wheel turn smooth.Flushed my 08 bmw 328i at 80k. Old fluid came out pitch black and this new fluid is pink.
Awesome microbfiber towel! I just wish it did not have the tag attached to it - it leaves a mark if you let it contact the surface of your car.What can I say, It does what it says. Just make sure to keep it upright. If its on its side or upside down it will leak slightly. Not sure why someone would put it in that position but just a heads up. Cant beat the price on Amazon. Especially if you have prime !I think this Hitchmate Hand Signal Cover is such a cute idea.  My dad loves it, which surprised me.  He doesn't strike me as someone who likes cute.  I tried it out on his Jeep Wrangler, which has the larger receiver.  It fit just fine. Once the hardware is installed (takes four screws), it's easy on easy off.  What the hitch cover is missing is the locking pin.  If you buy this, you need to provide your own locking pin.The fingers bend to make whatever hand gestures I want.  Some fingers don't bend completely when the hand is on the car in certain directions because the car gets in the way.  I'm sure this is more or less of a problem depending on the type of car.  If I want to turn the hand from upright to horizontal, I need to unscrew the hardware and reposition it.Everyone instinctively knows what hand gesture they'd like this hitch cover to make.  It's capable of that, also.  Some jokesters can have a field day with it.  Depending on where you park, just be careful.
First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room.This little converter is a good deal for the price and will pull the current rating listed on it! So that's why I rated it a 5 star.This is a must if you use the Moroso tire gauge. I do not know why it is sold separately. It should come pre fitted to the gauge. I'm sure no one will complain given the fact that it protects the gauge against knocks, even if it added a few bucks to the gauge, which is not cheap in the first place.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RV
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.This is a great price for a replacement cabin air filter for my 2005 Toyota Corolla. It works fine and is easy to install (especially if you've done it before).
I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.I put my sports car to bed in the winter, battery would be dead with out this charger.  Needed an extension to reach the carPurchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
The newer Qx4/Pathfinders call for the XX14612 filter, which seems smaller than this PL14610 filter. Not sure if the filter material/pleats are equal or not. I've seen a few Qx4/Pathfinder owners continue to use the 14610 even though their year/make calls for 14612.Regardless, my 2001 Qx4 calles for the 14610. Nonetheless, there's not much to say about this filter. I use it and rely a lot on the brand, model, and other remarks on the Purolate PureONE line.I've been happy with the prices I generally see on Amazon, so will continue to purchase for my vehicles.5/5 for availability :)A product that's been around in the same form for this many years speaks for itself.  I started looking around for body filler for a project, and was amazed at all the companies selling body filler, and all the options out there.  Jeez, when I searched automotive for &#34;body filler&#34; I was overwhelmed.  Maybe all those more expensive types are something special that YOU need, but I use what I know works for me.  No need to experiment or spend more.Quality compared to 2 other kits like this I have had, this is the best so far. Not the typical cheesy plastics you find in some sellers stuff.Best thing to do with fuses when doing wind and solar power systems, buy lots. I have saved this seller and their links for future needs.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.The straight foot design and robust construction of this tire pressure gauge makes it THE choice for checking inside dual wheels!
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.
Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.After owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!!
I'm hoping the quality holds up as they appear plastic and my trailer weighs  over 5000lbs and sits on a small incline.  I will correct my review if they don't work but they were a good price.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderthey are light and smaller than you would expect, but they work fine and store easy as they fit into one another (stackable)
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderFits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.I just installed 3 of these and they fit well and are well made. I am expecting them to hold up for years.They are small, but they are sturdy and stand up well under the weight of the two front jacks of my trailer.
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.
Measured my front and rear tires.  Front 6/32, rear 8/32.  Time to rotate.Accuracy is cleaverly done by putting the numbers around the barrel so accuracy is increased because numbers are spread apart.  Mechanically simple and small to fit in glove commpartment.Can't imagine any advantage to paying more for such a simple tool when this one works so well.  Quality is medium but more than sufficient for this purpose.  Only a few measurements needed for tires.  This tools is the one to buy.OTC makes good strong tools. This front service kit has worked like a charm for every front end suspension job I have done. Its  a must have kit to do front end service. Works for many makes and models. The case is durable and keeps everything organized. &#34;BUY IT&#34; it pays for its self, as soon as you use it one time.Great product!!  I'm going to make it pay for itself by checking and clearing the "Check Engine" lights for my friends (for a fee).  Down side is that installation brackets are not included or even offered.  The manufacturer expects everybody to use hook and loop tape.

Works great.  Would recommend.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made.
I was looking for this air filter on the K&N website and went to AutoZone priced at 50-60 bucks. I put in my car info said, doesn't fit. BUT, it DOES fit my 2004 Crown Victoria perfectly.This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.
Easiest way to apply:2x plastic spoonsSmall paper bowl or plate (do not use cups because they make it difficult to fully mix)Make sure you do not use the same spoon  for scooping out different ingredients, one spoon goes in epoxy, the other in hardener, they never touch. Scoop one on one side of the plate and one on the other. If you want you can have a small scale under plate to get perfect ratio, but I've been able to eyeball it without any problemsThis stuff is absolutely amazing for covering up exposed fiberglass on boat bottom (scrapes from beaching), old screw holes, lots of repairs where gelcoat is damaged. It should not be used for any structural repairs, use fiberglass + resin for that, this is only gelcoat/small non-structural holesIt sands very well using ultrasonic sander, hand sanding works too but takes a while. Try to get it as smooth as possible before it fully dries, I used my hand in rubber glove to smooth it out, then sand when fully cured the next dayi purchased this to attach some decorative automotive products to my jeep wrangler.it is a bit on the flimsy side compared to something you could choose to pay $30+ for, but i have put probably 20 or so rivets through it so far without any issue.  the head can be chanced out easily for different sized rivets.  so far for 10 bucks i am very happy with it.A very simple concept but someone had to be the first to invent it. I suspect others will soon imitate this.Photos show lifting tires. No doubt it would work fine for that - especially with heavy, over size tires (as shown) or farm equipment tires. But it's good for so much more.A piece of steel under the corner of a small building, set hooks under the steel, and lift the building for re-leveling. Hook it under a mower deck of a riding mower to remove/sharpen blades.You trust your jack, now trust the accessories they provide so you can get the most from it. Be sure to get the base for the jack, better than carrying around a piece of 2x6 and no one will toss it on your camp fire, either.
One side goes to your propane cylinder and other side goes to your regulator.  Make sure you put some pipe dope on the 1/4"  to seal it or yellow gas tape.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Although my camper is a pop up hard sided unit, it has a scissor jack at each corner with small pods attached to the jacks to keep the camper from rocking. These pads keep the camper feet from sinking into the ground and help to keep the camper level and eliminates rocking. They are easily cleaned if you put the waffle side up and let the smooth side touch the ground.
This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket.This is a great item.  Works well.  Indicator lights let you know the status of the battery.  Very pleased with this battery tender.This stuff works great and wow, when you pay $1.00 in the auto store for a little squirt, this is a tremendous deal!!
I bought this stove top cover to use in my RV to give me more work space, since I rarely use the stove itself.  It fits perfectly and does exactly what I want it to do.  And it is sturdy.If you have never used a clay bar to remove contaminents, this is the one to try. It works exactly as advertised.I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.

A well made piece. This brush is not too stiff and the ice scrapper part is located on the opposite side of the handle (convenient if you only need to brush off the show or leaves). Rubberized handle allows for a good, solid grip. Lightweight.The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?Hard to complain, it's a funnel, it's a good length and width for awkwardly located fills. Has a guard on the top for spill prevention, feels sturdy and durable, and the price is more than fair. What's not to like?
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied.

This strainer works, but can't fit even full size plates! It also is very flimsy. I would find another one!The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat.
Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPSHavent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as well
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.This fits my 2004 Lexus RX330 perfectly. IMHO I feel that thisplain paper is superior to "carbon" type filters. How long can athin sprinkling of "carbon" last? Plus you can easily see howdirty the filter actually is and replace accordingly.  A good value.I needed a decent filter wrench for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel.  The filter is up beside the engine and is best reached from below.  This wrench grips the round Amsoil Filter, Which is not wrench friendly with it's smooth surface. It holds the filter securely while I turn it with my 3/8&#34; ratchet using a nine&#34; extension.  Make sure you get the right size range for your filter size.
If you want this in chrome type the letter C infront of it in your search.  I love the welded nut option it is a life saver for motorcycles or small engine bays.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I have a 2007 RAV 4 V6 and change my own oil. This tool fits the cannister perfectly and makes installing a new filter cartridge and "O" rings a snap. You just need a common 3/8" rachet driver to fit the hole. Worth every penny for this well made, accurate, quality product. If you have one of the 65 mm canister type filter housings, and change your own oil, you can't do better than this. Highly recommended.

And I have a SUV. I was able to only use one of the applicator. But with this one I am glad I got it. I approve this review.

Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair.If you want this in chrome type the letter C infront of it in your search.  I love the welded nut option it is a life saver for motorcycles or small engine bays.
I just installed it today and fits perfectly for my Honda Accord 2007 SE.It's cheaper on Amazon than in a store for the same brand.As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.This was a fraction of the price of the ones at the store and fit perfectly for my 2004 Lexus RX 330 AWD.
perfect fot connecting 2 tug 'em straps together or making a hook up loop on one end, a must have item if you go 4 wheeling anywhere where you could get stuck in sand, mud etc.I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!I have a 2001 Silverado with a 5.3 engine. On the 2001, 5.3 engine the Knock sensors sit in deep pockets. Water tends to get down in there sooner or later and that causes the knock sensors to fail. Replace the harness while you are at, as the harness is the seal.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
Caps do the job, noting special, but if you have lost one of your valeve caps these are good replacement for factoryput them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions.These are basically a good product. I would say they are better than the OE catches on my RV. But make sure you keep the screws from the existing catches, or better yet, buy a pack of stainless screws. These do not come with mounting screws. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I wish it came with a locking pin instead of the bolt, but other than that, this is a good solution for mounting my bike on the back of my Jeep with an oversized spare.
The deflector does a good job navigating the air in the direction desired and the magnets reliably hold it in place on a vertical vent in a wall. I am happy with the product, happy enough to order another one!I have a 2001 Silverado with a 5.3 engine. On the 2001, 5.3 engine the Knock sensors sit in deep pockets. Water tends to get down in there sooner or later and that causes the knock sensors to fail. Replace the harness while you are at, as the harness is the seal.I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance.

Had these in past years and then lost them somewhere.These things are perfect for frozen windows on cars.They get that ice off quick and do not harm the glass in any way.Amazon should be commended for offering these, you usually have to go to the auto supply shops to get these.Most times these shops in my locale don't have 'em on hand so you have to wait until they order them.Why not order them thru Amazon and get them with free shipping when enough items are ordered?Thank you AmazonIts what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change.
There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked.I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them.
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesYes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine.
No, I wouldn't use this to power a generator from 12' from my vehicle so my kids could play XBox...but it works perfectly well in my application. I run a 12V air compressor mounted in my truck with this from a standard 12V socket in my Mustang. It has never let me down, blown a fuse, or caused any weird power spikes/drops. It serves its purpose well!It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!I use this on my r1 during the cold days in winter or when ever i put the bike in to storage. Still working till now and this includes a spare wire to place a dis-connectable connector from your battery to the battery tender (which can be routed from your battery to your backseat compartment) Highly recommended.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
I do a lot of brake and suspension work on my track car, and "Copper" Anti-seize is highly recommended as they have higher tolerant of heat than regular anti-seize. This 8oz. bottle will last you a life time if you only occasionally DIY on your vehicle.  For the price, this deal can't be beat....I bought this to simply pop the lower ball joint on my 2006 Land Rover LR3 with 70K miles. I couldn't use the venerable pickle fork, so I had to breakdown and buy a front end set. This kit paid for itself in this one job alone. The dealer wanted over $700 for this job; It cost me $200 for parts and $94 for this kit. I used the longest puller for my job and it easily popped off the ball joint with just a couple of cranks with a normal length 1/2 drive breaker bar. The puller didn't even flinch. No warps or bends in the claws.I suspect this kit will serve me for life since I won't be abusing it with a commercial rate of use. I do work on cars more than the average backyard mechanic and I am confident you don't need to drop $400 more on a commercial grade name brand set.This is a must-have if you have a wall charger as the length is great and if your battery is not close to the charger. I use mine for charging my RV truck battery and the house side battery at the same time, as I have a Battery Tender 'Y' for charging more than 1 battery. This is heavy-duty and works for both my Battery Tender plus and my Battery MINDer's; at a great price. I highly recommend this, and the Y for 2 or more batteries, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
This filter was easy to install and fit perfectly. Why pay three times the price to have someone else do it?Works great. All the horror stories I read on this made me skeptical. I use mine to pull my fishing boat. Most negative reviews I read dealt with bike racks. What would you expect having that much leverage twisting on a thin rv bumper???I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.
I have one of these in each of my vehicles, either in the door pocket, center console or glove box.  I didn't mount them because having them loose in a covered compartment seemed a better idea.  I also have the key chain versions (ResQme)as a back-up in case the trapped person cannot reach the one in the door, etc.I have only had to use this device once when a Blazer flipped over on the Interstate in front of me.  The first person on the scene tried several times to break the rear window with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful.  My life-hammer did the job effortlessly with the first swing, and the seat-belt cutter quickly ripped through the belt to release the trapped driver!These should seriously be standard equipment in ALL vehicles!Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag.
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance.I underestimate the size of this level (although it was stated in the specs): I was expecting a small bulls-eye level, around 1" in diameter. This thing is 4 times the size! But regardless, it works as it is supposed to. I've contemplated mounting it to our travel trailer via the screw-holes or double sided tape but haven't just yet. I want to make sure the thing will hold up to some weathered-use before I drill holes into a metal component. Not bad for &lt;$4 (at the time of this review).I have a GM 1995 OBDI engine and the adapter they shipped for GM did not fit my connector so I had to return the whole unit.  I'm now back to grounding out the data pin and watching the flash code on the check engine light for trouble codes.  It's important to check your adapter fit before purchase since that's what you will rely on to get the data into the unit.I liked the unit's design - it came in two zipper bags that zipped together to hold the cables and adapters in one bag and hold the tool and book in a separate pouch.  You can also unzip one zipper and lay them side by side to go in a tool box drawer.I wish the adapter would have fit my vehicle - if it did I would have kept this unit because of all the features it offers.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Very happy with this purchase, as it save piling bricks or boards under the trailer tongue jack to shorten the amount of cranking necessary.  I would recommend this to anyone with a trailer.I bought this to simply pop the lower ball joint on my 2006 Land Rover LR3 with 70K miles.

Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...works fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.
Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
so this sat around for awhile before i used it and sure enough i go to use it and the top of the UNOPEN tube is hardened and unuse able this is BS and i cant even retuen itI had read many mixed reviews but I ordered this wrench hoping it would work out well for me. Unfortunately, for my circumstances I found it difficult to get the wrench to grip the oil filter. You MUST be able to get one hand on the filter to hold the jaws of the wrench in place as you move the wrench to loosen to filter. I found this to be more trouble than it's worth. Maybe it would work better on another vehicle with more room to work and a different size filter. I was able to turn my filter by hand, but if I couldn't I'm sure I could have gotten this wrench to work, but it was more difficult than I was expecting.I bought this for the wrong Jeep so I returned it anyway, but it seemed very flimsy to me. A screwdriver could easily get this mechanism open.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...i used on rear brake shoe replacement.  It goes on easily without fuss or mess.  Hopefully it performs as expected.
Does everything. I can see when the tanks flush out clean. Has a valve so you can easily flush a tank and do it again if it needs more. Flush out the sewer hose when you are done. Should be standard item on a new RV.This blade works great however you need to know a few things.  The ice will destroy it over time if you try and run this + windshield washer fluid in the winter on an uncleared windshield.  If you at using this in the rain/show though it will work great.  Another thing is that you can't use rain-x with this it will cause smearing.What can I say, It does what it says. Just make sure to keep it upright. If its on its side or upside down it will leak slightly. Not sure why someone would put it in that position but just a heads up. Cant beat the price on Amazon. Especially if you have prime !
BACKGROUND:Our travel trailer came with baggage door catches on all of the exterior compartments except for the largest one at the rear of the trailer. After struggling with this compartment for one summer with bungie cords and whatever else, I decided to install a proper catch. Half of the challenge was trying to figure out what this part was called but I guess if you made it here you've figured that out already!MY EXPERIENCE:The door catch itself seems well made. Contrary to the previous reviewer, mine was very white (much whiter than the "white" siding on the trailer). My main complaint is that there are no directions and no mounting fasteners. I installed it by drilling two holes in the fibreglass siding and then using some drywall type anchors (the kind where you insert the plastic plug first and then turn in a screw to expand the plastic plug). There also was no sealant or gasket so I siliconed the backside of the door catch before installation and then siliconed around the door catch after installation. Is this the proper way to install it? I have no idea. I just hope it lasts.Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires.I was looking for a small air compressor to fill basketballs, bike tires, car tires, etc.  This compressor works fine but it has to be one of the worst designed products I've purchased in recent memory.  The power cord is about 12" long, as is the air tube.  Who thought that was a good idea?  Meanwhile, there's about 50' long cable for the 12V adapter.  This actually makes more sense but since I'm not using the 12V it just gets in the way.  Of course, you can store the 12V cable in a nice little storage space in the unit...except that's where they decided the put the power switch!  Are you kidding me?  The power switch is located deep inside some hole in the back of the unit?  Are the designers insane?  I'm stuck with this thing but you might want to look elsewhere.
I love it. Can also use to leave vehicle outside so the BatteryMinder ( Tender ) stays dry in the garage, if it rains outside. A must have for me. I want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf, not under the hood in a hot engine bay.This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing.Very sturdy. Easy to drive up on when in the dirt, cement or gravel.  Slides backwards in the snow & we carry large nails to keep it in place in the snow.  They are quite large and barely fit into our storage compartment.  We had to cut off the handle in back to get it to fit.
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it.I purchased this wheel lock punch for my newly acquired OEM wheel locks i purchased from Amazon. The only thing i hate about this pouch is that it is not made of the material depicted in the picture. It is made out of Nylon.I needed a decent filter wrench for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel.  The filter is up beside the engine and is best reached from below.  This wrench grips the round Amsoil Filter, Which is not wrench friendly with it's smooth surface. It holds the filter securely while I turn it with my 3/8&#34; ratchet using a nine&#34; extension.  Make sure you get the right size range for your filter size.
My last bottle of wax was Mothers California Gold. To be honest I can't tell any difference between that and the NuFinish either in applying it or the end result. Both are great.I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...Hi All.There is not a whole lot you can say about a "Plastic Bag Holder"  It does do as it says it does, and that is a place to stroe your Plastic Bags in your RV.  Its neat and orderly to use.  Only real issues, is look at the size of your RV's Cabinet Doors and measure before you do buy this Plastic Bag Holder.  It is made very well for what it is.  Its a very Heavy Duty Plastic made holder.  I was a little surprized at the size of it.  I too, should have measured.  But it did work out for us, as we have faily large Cabint Doors in our Motorhome.  You could also mount it inside of a Cabinet or on a Closet Wall, out of the way also.  And it does hold a fair amount of Plastic bags, for later use.  Happy Travels.
If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations, this is it. If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it. Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt. Its going to shine. Great automotive or household maintenance product.If you are a professional or just a want a be then this is a great product for you!!!!  Your car will look like glass when done!!!This product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover.  While it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint.  If you use this product I recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as Meguiar's  Ultimate Wax.  (paste or liquid)
This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...And because of this fact, I use this product. If you frequent non Tier One fuel suppliers, as many of us occasionally do, you should regularly use this or a similar product to insure that your fuel system is kept clean, lubricated and properly functioning. Certain automotive industry professionals and automotive industry publications suggest that a steady diet of economy gasoline will ultimately result in costly repairs due to dirty or contaminated fuel delivery systems. So, to minimize the incidence of expensive repairs such as fuel pump and fuel injector replacement, I use this product with which I'm very happy.This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket.This little thing works perfectly!  I use to use a pressure bleeder, but was concerned about what some people say, that pressure bleeders push more air into the brake fluid, which causes both more air and moisture to absorb into the fluid.  Best way is to press the brake pedal, or put a vacuum on the bleeder screws.  A vacuum would be nice, but also a lot more work to setup initially.Instructions say this check valve does not work on air, only brake fluid, but on empty systems you can still pump the pedal until fluid comes out, and run your drain side pipe into a container that has brake fluid at the bottom.  That way you only suck back up fluid, not air.  Once you have fluid in the lines, this is completely unnecessary.  Did all 8 bleed screws on a Brembo-equipped car, was effortless.  I completely trust this little check valve, hope it lasts.  Rinsed it out with simple green and then a little PB Blaster to keep it from corroding or whatever.Remember to buy a couple more yards of cheap 3/16" clear hose from the hardware store, so you'll never run out, and can throw away what you've used after each brake job.The included hose clamp is worthless, but you don't need it anyways.Another great trick to compress pistons is to crack open the bleeder screw first, then push in each brake piston.  Fluid will go out through this check valve, instead of fighting every other brake piston.  Makes life a LOT easier, and does not push old fluid back up the brake lines or risk overflowing your reservoir.
Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.The small size of this drainer is perfect for any camper.  The little cut-out on the bottom fits over the edge of the sink.The overall length is 16 inches. About 4 inches for the handle. So yes there are plenty of bristles to clean the wheel. Finally, I can clean my Dodge Charger 5 spokes wheels perfectly. It reaches everywhere. And that seller sells it for less than another one on Amazon sold as a "16 inch" brush. Well this one is also 16 inches and it is Prime eligible. I wish I had that brush years ago. Give it a try.

In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function.This is just the perfect fit for my 2001 Honda Accord - passenger side. I bought a pair along with the driver side wiper that is 5 inch longer. Replacing is a cinch (I mean if you have already replaced a wiper before, all it takes is 30 seconds).My old one is steel framed "Rain X", it is broken now. Part of the rubber squeegee is peeling like a piece of string cheese hanging down. Not to discredit it, but it lasted also a couple of years and I have no problem getting the same product except I wanted to try something else. The Bosch 4819 is sleeker looking. Very lightweight and works perfect with no streaks. Very happy with it - I just have to see how long it will last through summer and winter seasons in Virginia weather.
This is a piece of junk.! The straps stretch, the plastic clips slip off while tightening, and the dam things fall off while driving. Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on.  They do work well.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing.

These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too.
bought for all the traveling we do its durable doesn't leak easily and is accurate .conveniently shaped to get into the valve  stemsfits perfectly in  one side of the rv double sink.  Additionally can sit on the Tray and drain into the sink as well.Due to size does not hold many dishes but adequate for my useI needed this in order to drain the waste tanks on our RV in case I wasn't able to do so on way home from a trip (or removing antifreeze from tanks in the Spring).  It twists on fine, makes a good seal to the drain fitting, and the hose outlet fitting does end up on the bottom so almost no liquid is left inside when draining is done.
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room.
I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.What can we say about this thermostat? It is a Stant. Arguably, the best thermostat available for cars. It was priced right and processed/delivered promptly.It's sta-bil how can it be wrong and this is the best price I could find. I am very happy.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.A bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way.  It's manageable to lock and unlock, but you have to do it at a slight angle and/or wiggle it in.  The black makes it look hidden and matches nice.
I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.What is not to love about a cheap genuine K&N; product?  It fit in my car with zero issues and its K&N; so you know its quality.On a nice side note for the men out there,  K&N; includes a sticker to put on the air box that says the filter is a K&N; product and does not need to be replaced.  I only say this because my wife has had people who change her oil try to sell her a new one.  This was a nice thing to see in the package.  They even include a card to put in the glove box with a 1 800 number for a service station to call if they don&#8217;t believe it!I have always put a K&N; air filter in my car and as long as they are around I always will.  Plus Amazon had them for about 30-50% than other places I looked.I have no issues!Like Life Insurance, nobody ever hopes they have to use a Life Hammer. The two Mythbuster episodes about a car going into a lake were enough to make me purchase one of these for each of my cars. The most recent episode showed what happens when a car flips over in a lake (apparently a fairly common scenario). They showed that it is virtually impossible to escape the flipped car with no tools. Therefore, I purchased the Life Hammer.We do not regularly pass by a body of water that could require the use of this device, but I'd much rather have this inexpensive insurance than not.This is a standard design. The hammers are about six inches long and a fluorescent red. There is a glow in the dark dot that I hope I never have to see in dark water because I'm not certain that dot would help much. One end is a metal tool to shatter a window, and the other end is a protected blade used to cut a seatbelt.The real issue with these is how to mount them in your car so they are easy to get at, but out of the way enough that they aren't an eyesore. No mounting material is supplied with these. The small instruction sheet recommends using two Velcro pads. For the non-mechanically inclined, this is a good idea. For the more mechanically inclined, screwing down the black base is a better way to go. As the directions warned, be sure to check behind the panel before you drill.Someday it would be interesting to break a car window just to see how these work. I understand that they take very little force to do their job. Glad I purchased this little bit of insurance.
There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked.The reason I am giving the lock three stars is the lock would not work for our trailer hitch. we have a Lance trailer and the hitch was to wide for the lock to fit over. I may grind down the sides of our hitch so I may use it, I will check with Lance first so not to weeken the hitch if for and reason it may then the reese lock is unuseable for my lance trailer and I will pass the lock on to someone who can use it.I had never bothered to measure tread depths until I bought a travel trailer and realized you can wear the tread right off if you have the wrong electric brake controller installed. I bought one of these depth gauges so I can periodically measure the tread depth to be sure my brakes are working right. It does the job and is easy to use.
If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.there are a number of misunderstandings about this product:what it is:  it is a washer fluid concentrate where you add 4 oz per gallon of water.... you don't need anything else unless you are using it below freezing...  so in warm climates its an all in one productantifreeze:  if you need to use it in sub freezing weather, just add 1/2 bottle of rubbing alcohol and it works fine down to about -20Fyou can add it to washing fluids if you want, but seems like sort of a waste of moneyIMPORTANT:  the rain x effect is cumulative with this product, it builds up over time and stays at its best when you always use it, not just every other bottle or whatever....  I live in FL, use this in plain water every time and nothing else, and my windshield  sheds water like crazy, I almost never need to use the wipers....  if you USE IT CONSISTENTLY IT WORKS PERFECTbecause this one came with the replacement cap, it gets 5 stars.  Those cheap plastic caps with the enormous 32mm head suck and whoever designed them should be shot.  I cant tell you how many times I have done the oil change after someone else and this freakin plastick piece would not come out without warping and damaging it.  If you have not done your oil change yet, you will be glad you have a spare plastic cap on hand.  I recommend changing every 4-5 oil changes even if you dont damage because of the o-ring and the fact that plastic of any grade is not designed to withstand the constant temperature range of hot engine oil.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.I installed these on my 2003 Forest River Sunseeker 3100SS motorhome. I used a tiny piece of 5lb 2 way tape on the corner for added security. Works GREAT!  Been driving all summer with these and still there. Would recommend!strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.
please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesThese are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.Microfiber so far is microfiber, they all seem to clean about the same, some leave behind a little less lent than others but for the price these aren't bad.  Now that being said these are smallest microfiber wash-cloths I have ever seen.  Seriously they are the same size as most washcloths, they are tiny! The package makes them seem bigger than they are.
These snap on gutter extensions are a must for RV's that don't have them. They just snap on to the existing small gutter extensions supplied by the RV manufacturers.  Keeps those black streaks from forming on the side of your RV. I don't understand a reviewer who stated he's never seen them in 40 years of camping. We had them on our 2007 Jayco Eagle and now on our 2014 Cougar HC 321RES trailer. They are cheap- they work & they just snap on or off.Takes a lickin & keeps ticken.....These are light weight and do the job, to help stabilizer ground pads from sinking into softer surfaces.  Our stabilizer foot pads are about the same as I have seen on the majority of campers under 7000lbs, so they should do great for most campers.  Do recommend them to anyone looking for such an aid, especially camping in sandy or light soil conditions, and they are durable.I bought these because they were marketed alongside the Camco tripod stabilizer jacks and I assumed they would fit.  They do not.  They are not big enough for a tripod jack base.  However, they will work fine with the single-leg swing-down jacks at the back of our trailer and are a lot nicer than the blocks of wood my husband has been using!
Bought this to allow the use of the std Tender for an outside car, run this from the garage to the driveway, works just the way it is supposed to...Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool!I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above.
I used these two jack stands to hold a Nissan Maxima front end up and they worked without any issues. I will be testing the locking pins to see if they will hold the weight when the latch arm is pulled because I'm curious.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.These work great.Only need a small flat tip screw driver to pull back on the clips to remove the old ones and install the new ones.  Don't remove the clips completely, just pull them back a little bit and lift the hood gently at the same time.  2 people makes this a flash.
Although my camper is a pop up hard sided unit, it has a scissor jack at each corner with small pods attached to the jacks to keep the camper from rocking. These pads keep the camper feet from sinking into the ground and help to keep the camper level and eliminates rocking. They are easily cleaned if you put the waffle side up and let the smooth side touch the ground.Two of thes pads, under my Camco RV jack stands, raise the stands to the proper heighth for my pop-up.  They don't slip or slide on hard or soft surfaces.I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chocked
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine.

They work as described for my RV trailer.  Sturdy, hard plastic with a flat side and an indented, grid on the other side.  The velcro strap holds them together nice and neat.  I'm not sure these would work for motorhome jacks, however.  They work great for me.I installed these on my 2003 Forest River Sunseeker 3100SS motorhome. I used a tiny piece of 5lb 2 way tape on the corner for added security. Works GREAT!  Been driving all summer with these and still there. Would recommend!
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.I have this unit, then I bought a Bosch unit that was a disaster (have a review on here as well). This ctek is just perfect.  I bought the bosch because it was on sale, but that was just a waste of cash.  these ctek units are simply fantastic and work as you would expect.  They work as designed but also as you would expect (e.g. - memory when power goes out, it knows what it was doing last and will go back to it)To clarify this will fix any DTC codes you are getting from a bad fuel cap. The handle is not as wide as the original so the grip is not as easy but it works.
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.I use this battery tender for my Harley Davidson. With the OEM security system, the Harley can drain a battery quickly, making it a hard start on those cool fall mornings. When we are up north at our lake home, the HD does not have a garage to be placed in, so I will use this  battery tender outside and did not trust using the normal battery tender out side with not protection, so I was using a pail to place over the tender. Now I can use this one without worry.Would purchase again.
bought to change  coil springs on  a camaro they  arived very well  packaged  i would  say  any one  looking for  a set  to  buy  this set you  wont  be  sorryWhat a ripoff, you can buy this at a parts store for  $5. With advance auto coupon code for 3"% off it's $4To me? Grabage... the quality of this set has gone downhill IMO... I have an older set that rocks so I bought this newer set for another trailer - garbage.  Mismatched looking pins and locks. Hitch cover lock is plactic and doesnt hold well. I would recommend buying local so that you can try it and return it... Thank you AMAZON for allowing me to return this POG.
I bought these horns to replace my rusted out horns on my camaro.  Note that you need the high and low as they work in unison.  It took me about 15 min to replace them and these work as good as new. You'll have to splice in to your existing wiring ( I just used some 3m quick connects to splice in ) and I reused the stock locations and bolts.  These horns come with brackets as well.They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.Dixit
Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.My 2000 bmw 323i 5 speed transmission did not like redline manual transmission fluid, but i thought it was good so i bought this one for my differential.I might have to change to Royal Purple soon.
I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers.As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price.This little converter is a good deal for the price and will pull the current rating listed on it! So that's why I rated it a 5 star.This is a good low cost feeler gauge set that is suitable for your shop.  Recommend this one for most applications.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good LuckI bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
I highly recommend this product for when you want to re-oil your K&N or any brand of high perf air filter whether it be cone or panel. Not as much waste , easier to apply than the squirt bottle type.This sheepskin item could be thicker and longer. It still does what it's supposed to do though. My older one was not as long, so this one is certainly an improvement. I could not find this locally either. It's an all-natural product too. If your seatbelt bothers you, check it out.I drive a CLS 550 AMG Mercedes which is high maintenance.  Once a month I flush my tank out with this.  If I have any left over I put it in my brother's truck.  Both vehicles run like champs.  I notice a significant performance increase when the gas has the Techron in it.  Not just for high performance vehicles, but any vehicle can benefit from being cleaned and flushed with this product.  If you don't think so, buy a bottle and prove me wrong (unless your vehicle doesn't have an engine, then I'm wrong).  :)
I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.Haven't used it yet, but i checked that it fits. I hope I can easily get the filter off to do my own changes. They shipped it to APO, which is always a good thing. I bought this because a regular oil filter wrench doesn't work that well on this style of filter.
Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage, from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges. I need to buy another pack though, for the back doors protection too, as it is not long enough for both doors. We don't need it for the back doors very often, but I think it will come in handy at times. Since we like this so much, we will be buying another.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.

As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.
Used this RTV to create a gasket on an F150 differential cover. Used about 1/3 to 1/2 tube on the diff cover to ensure adequate coverage.  Applied around the bolt holes.  Begins to get tacky in about 5 minutes. Installed diff cover and finger tightened bolts, let set for approx. 1 hour.  Then tightened bolts to OEM specs.  Filled with gear oil and no leaks.Armor All tire shine does a great job.  I use it on two vehicles tires, a Malibu and Chev 2500 Pickup.  Lasts a couple of weeks, unless it rains of course.  I get 3 to 4 all tire shines per can.  Recommend!I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months.

Read the postings on ClubLexus and found Denso 234-9009 is perfect fit for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (behind firewall, access from underneath the vehicle).  Removing the connector is the biggest job.  Used a pickup tool with wire prongs to hold the sensor connector part from the top, pressed the tab on the right connector and disconnected relatively easily.  Jacked up the front passenger side, went underneath the vehicle and sprayed PB blaster penetrating oil on the old sensor threads, waited for a few minutes and was able to get it out easily using an O2 sensor removal tool.  Applied the anti-seize that came with the package on the new sensor threads and installed.  Total time spent was under 30 minutes!  Disconnected the battery negative terminal for a few minutes, then started the engine and the codes didn't come back!  Check out the pictures posted in the images section.This sensor works for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (before catalytic converter, access from underneath the vehicle) and Bank 2 Sensor 1 (between the engine and radiator, accessed from the top).Note: Recommend using two jack stands for added safety while working under the vehicle.PB Blaster:Blaster 16-PB Penetrating Catalyst - 11 oz.O2 Sensor Tool:Powerbuilt 648691 Oxygen Sensor Offset PullerUpdate: February 16, 2014The Check Engine Light (CEL) is staying off and the mileage has improved.  My vehicle registration is coming up and it is due for SMOG check.  I'll update the review with the results of the test.Ordered many brushes. Some of my brush will remain dry to dust off the brake parts, another brush to dust off electric fan grills and A/C window units near the filter. Another to quick clean my chain saw of sawdust before I open the oil tank cover and inside the safety guard filled with sawdust. Have one in the kitchen to wash with water the many parts of the machine we use for cooking. That will stay in the kitchen to avoid contamination. And cost effective enough to have some for spare since it takes a few days to receive it from the mail.
Purchased this item to keep on my motorcycle should I pick up a nail/screw while away from home. Tucks away nice and neatly.I did use one plug, it performed as it should and held fine without any air leaks.If making a permanent repair, I would use a combo patch/plug which installs from inside the tire.I purchased this for a small RV modification. My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.  I have used these before for water hoses, and though it says &#34;electric cable hatch&#34; it will work fine for a standard RV freshwater hose too.I use this in our travel trailer. It's a good fit on the counter, but the stand needs to be a bit taller to be able to slope the water toward the sink, so I end up propping the end up a bit. I don't use it for storing since it's an open grate on the bottom and don't want to chance spilling any detergent or soap during transit.
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.I received this seat a year ago as gift.  I enjoyed it enough I've ordered two for my brother and a friend that are car enthusiasts.  It's perfect to work my cars from eye level to waist height while sitting.  Example: headlight, wheel well, door, and interior.  The tray comes handy for a beer :p But it has dividers to separate fasteners, tools, and my refreshments.  The cushion is still comfortable.  I've used it handful of times in a year of time.  So I can't comment on the durability or comfort of the seat for long and frequent usage.It was simple putting the seat together.  If you work enough in the garage, you have enough wrench time to put this together.  It's worth the luxury.
Fits fine on a greased 2&#34; ball.  The plastic or vinyl is very flexibile, and can be squeezed to create a slight vacuum to help it glide into place. Otherwise the trapped bubble of air underneath needs to be worked out before it fully seats.Recommended.An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.
I have found few RV camp sites to be level. I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well. I always feel like the trailer is leaning when I walk around in it.With this bullseye level, I can place it on the trailer tongue or on the trailer floor as I do my leveling. I can quickly do the leveling with confidence. When I am done, I slip the bullseye in a drawer where it will be safe for my next trek.CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is.This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove!
The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.My Nissan Quest required a 28" and an 18". It wasn't until after I had them on for a while that I noticed the 28" does not cleanly touch the glass surface in the center of the spread, the point where the blade attaches to the wiper arm. This leaves a wet 2" channel arc right in my line of sight. I thoroughly examined the blade and the attachment, making sure it was attached as intended. It was. My guess is that the pressure that keeps the outer edges of the blade firmly on the glass is so strong it lifts the center up. The 18" appears to be ok. I wish I still had the box to send it back. Now I need another new blade.Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install.
These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition CoilDo what the ir suppossed to do.  I like these so much better than the MOPAR ones that wrap arounf the roll bar.  These actually use existing hardware on the sound bar or on the windsheild.  You can also place them behing the headrest.  I have the MOPAR velcro ones and these look so much better.
Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYIAmazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThis is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates.  I see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts....why why why??  Just remove the frame, get these caps and hide the ugly screws.  :)Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps.  Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem.
At about 3 bucks a piece they are an excellent buy. As all the other 5 star reviews have noted, they are soft and versatile. They do an amazing job on windows and mirrors. They are 16x24.I rated them 5 stars because they are excellent and an excellent value too.If you are looking for the next level, or you really want something dedicated to just babying your paint job, then these Cobra towels (  Cobra Miracle Towel 6 Pack ***NEW*** ) are pretty awesome. These towels run about $7.80 each with shipping, they're plusher, 70/30 towels and although they are the same size, 16x24, they seem a lot bigger and they feel much nicer.DarinWhat can one say, test leads they work and they are priced right one recommendation is to sell a kit with an assortment of ends.Korean made bulbs that may or may not be up to the standards of when they were European produced.However both bulbs worked and have been fine for the past month.  I do not believe these are as bright as the standard Osram European bulbs they replaced though.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckNo headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.This fit my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee V6. Price was great when I purchased. Can't beat having car parts shipped to your door for free.
Have not used it yet but nice to have when needed. Thought this would help winterize if no RV antifreeze available.Seems to work, can't tell if its really doing anything but if I have no problems then it must be working. LolI haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!
California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderNeed a 90 degree to make life easier on one of my bikes,  one has a 90 degree on the tires already but this fit the bill on my GL1200. only problem I can see is the pin in the center is  plastic so dont know the longevity on it.
I rated this product 5 stars for quality and ease of use. The scale is easy to read and moves easily and stays where it needs to be after reading the depth.This meter should be used as a general indication of voltage only. I checked it against a calibrated professional meter and found it to be reading 4 volts high. This put the reading in the read area when in fact the voltage was acceptable. I will still use it on my generator and simply subtract 4 volts from the reading. Used this way it is marginally effective.This digital gauge is easy to use and to read, even in bright sun light. It has a wide range so you can use it on high pressure tires.Alot of gauges only go up to 60 psi which is too low for load range E tires.
I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with 33&#34; tires that I just bought last year. I drive it around the 'burbs 99.999% of the time, so obviously I need a Hi-Lift X-Treme Jack and accessories to go with it the other 0.001% of the time.For my application, this works great. It's solid and looks cool.Exact fit for a '98 Nissan Frontier.  I have used Purolator in the past and I have no doubts that the pureone will exceed the requirements of my car.  -1 star because I feel that the metal casing is a little thin, it flexed pretty easily when I gripped it to installI presently use this in a 2007 Dodge Nitro SXT (56,000 miles) and a 2005 Yamaha Royal Star motorcycle (shaft drive, 88,000 miles) which are both frequently operated far from population centers. I've also used this in my previous Dakota pickup truck and my Mustang hardtop, total mileage on all vehicles in excess of 500,000 miles (206,000 on the Mustang, 166,000 on the Dakota) and no problems experienced with any of them. I consider it cheap "insurance" for vehicles I depend upon to get me wherever I need to be.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.As the title says, this accessory is worth getting with the jack. It secures the handle firmly and eliminates any vibration between the two.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderWell it just came today, looks better live then in the picture, I think it will be a perfect size for a weekend cruise.
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile.
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...
I was looking for this air filter on the K&N website and went to AutoZone priced at 50-60 bucks. I put in my car info said, doesn't fit. BUT, it DOES fit my 2004 Crown Victoria perfectly.It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Working well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckWorks just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter.

This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Super heavy chain.

I bought 2 of these.1 the key works with ease and turns no problem, the other one needs a little fiddling but comes off in less than a second still.Fits the proper 1/2&#34;Comes with a plastic cover to cover the key hole as well.4 stars because I feel they both should operate flawlessly like the better one.bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower.Great little kit that you can get everywhere but, it's Amazon pricing (even less than WallyWorld)This comes with a mounting bracket, don't buy on with it.  The unit is easy to install and is of sufficient quality that I expect it will last a few good years.  Plastic sprung closure of the round, rubber pop cap for the 5er.. I like this on my Tahoe and wiring was just a google away.
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.These seem to be happiest on concrete or hard ground, if the ground is soft or slightly unlevel they bow and will not stabilize the inside of the 5th wheel.Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.This is a great price for the cover and the filter.I paid less than $9 for both and they are OEM replacement parts.Great deal
Well....It's a good ball.  It's a shiny ball.  Exactly what it's supposed to be.  Pulls a trailer.  Very tough.  Thanks.This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug.  It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer.  The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew.  Even though this plug is only finger-tight.There are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare. It will last much longer, and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car.  The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining. It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it isn't anywhere near as bright as a flare. It has a single LED that is very directional. If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P. Logue, 2010
This product is great, I only bought one of the sheets and all you have to do is fill the open holes in you trunk. I only covered the holes on the trunk and on the rear deck lid for the speakers. I didnt notice a big difference while driving till i looked at my rpm gauge and it was at 3500!!!! i usually shift at 2300 rpm and it was soo quiet I did not realize the rpm's i was running!!!! This product dampened my car from the sports exhaust sooooo much!!!! Great if you have a different exhaust system!!! I am amazed on how much this product helps!! I am about to do my bottom of my trunk and my inside firewall and I know my car will almost sound electric from the interior!!! GREAT PRODUCT!!!My dealer had put a plate frame on my motorcycle when I bought it but it covered part of the info (numbers and State) which is not legal in NC. I liked the look and price of this one and bought it. And it looks nice and frames the plate without covering any of the info on the plate. I did have to use a snipper to cut off the top of two of the barbs to get the screws in but you can't tell.This is a nicer lock than I expected.  I missed this detail when I ordered it... but this lock is different than the other receiver lock I have used.  Most receiver locks (I think) use spring loaded pins to "lock".  When you unlock it you pull a sleeve out and then the springs push the pins away and the lock comes off.  This is all fine and good till you get some rust, then the springs can't push the pins out and you end up banging on the lock with a hammer for an hour (trust me, I know from experience)This pin has a T-shaped tip and the lock rotates around it to lock it in place.  This means there are no springs to jam.  The turning of the key directly unlocks the pin.  This seems much more robust to me.Notes on Material* The packaging states that the PIN is Stainless Steel.  It never claims the lock is all stainless.  I'm guessing the inside of the lock has some carbon steel due to strength requirements.* Some people have complained that the inside rusts.  I put a couple sprays of silicone in the lock to help protect from rust.Notes on Fit* This is longer than needed for my truck.  I have a 2012 F150 with the Max Tow package.  This is probably about 3/4" longer than what I need.  I was worried about it being too short so I ordered this "extended" version.  I suppose I should have just gone out and measured the hitch receiver.* Anyway, I am not worried.  I will probably add a couple o-rings (like others have said) to keep it from rattling too bad.Pictures* I took some pictures of the packaging and on my truck.  I thought it would be nice to see the notes on the packaging so thats why I took the pics...
I've been using brass scrapers for over 20 years. I have not had any problems with scratching; brass is softer than glass so it makes no sense that it would scratch the glass - must be the glass/snow/ice is dirty in which case any scraper is going to cause scratches. It is not a large scraper which makes sense because if it were any larger you would not be able to get enough leverage to make it work and you'd just bend the brass or break the plastic handle. Once you try it you'll throw your plastic scrapers in the trash.The ends fit snugly into the cord you're extending, and everything works fine...The plastic coating is overly stiff & just has a generally &#34;creepy&#34; (I don't know how else to describe it) feel to it.  It just feels cheap and makes a weirdly &#34;hollow&#34; sound as it clacks against the concrete.  It also is *very* stiff.  I've had one of these laying outside for a year and it still has the from-the-box kinks in it. It's unlike any other cord I have.Also...why not put the little protective cap on both ends to prevent crap from getting in there?  I know you can stick the two ends together to that effect when unused, but having the cap on only one end means you're 50/50 on the cord being the &#34;wrong way&#34; even though it's uni-directional...  Minor, but it's already pretty expensive for what amounts to be lamp cord with a special fitting on each end...This unit is great. The keyhole is sealed with a rubber cap to prevent dirt and moisture from entering and it is solid and strong. I had to tap the end lightly with a rubber mallet to get it through, but other than that it worked great! Comes with two keys.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!What can you say except that it holds a lot and has a big opening. The lid doesn't have a gasket so don't tilt or turn over. the only other small gripe is the hinge on the lid hits the handle and will probably help the fatigue factorbought for all the traveling we do its durable doesn't leak easily and is accurate .conveniently shaped to get into the valve  stems
Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.Make sure you use this any time you install new spark plugs - you'll be glad you did, when it comes time to change them again!
I purchased some much thicker microfibre towels, as these ones just aren't thick enough to soak up sufficient water. These are now relegated to cleaning the windows and wiping down the interiorYes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine.These tools are a must have for anyone who works on the interior of their car. The sizes and shapes included in this kit are well thought out and prevent any scratches and gouges to your car's interior when you are removing plastic panels and pieces. These will pay for themselves, even if used just once, as replacement plastic pieces for car interiors are quite expensive.
What else can you ask for? 3 Ton and light weight plus locking mechanism is way safer than the wedge cuts in regular ramps.I suggest that they cover the top with a rubber pad or silicon piece to help protect car and standThe picture is slightly misleading.

The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2. I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it. The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible.  WD40 did not work, neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3. So if you try to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4. When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples.

I personally did not need the grommets but the bolts were exactly what i needed.  Only negative is that the key for the bolts should have been grooved on both ends, as the groove is only on the tip of the long end leaving you to struggle with the short end of the key when the bolt gets really tight.  Advise using something like a Ratchet extender on it....

The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.

What can I say, It does what it says. Just make sure to keep it upright. If its on its side or upside down it will leak slightly. Not sure why someone would put it in that position but just a heads up. Cant beat the price on Amazon. Especially if you have prime !1. The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2. I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it. The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible.  WD40 did not work, neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3. So if you try to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4. When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples.This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked. When disconnected, it also does not leak (it does not pressure out unless you pump it).
I like this flexible funnel over others for two reasons:1) Length is excellent and makes it easy to access the filler hole.2) Bottom stopper lets me hang the item for storage without having to worry about excess fluid leaking everywhere.Unlike other funnels, you can't simply stick this in the hole and have it stand on its own due to the flexible tube. However, it does have a small hole in a plastic tab sticking out of the side of the rim which is perfect for threading a small hook or wire through and attaching it to the underside of the hood. All the benefits of a regular funnel with added flexibility and length - perfect.The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast.

The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.
bought to change  coil springs on  a camaro they  arived very well  packaged  i would  say  any one  looking for  a set  to  buy  this set you  wont  be  sorryTo me? Grabage... the quality of this set has gone downhill IMO... I have an older set that rocks so I bought this newer set for another trailer - garbage.  Mismatched looking pins and locks. Hitch cover lock is plactic and doesnt hold well. I would recommend buying local so that you can try it and return it... Thank you AMAZON for allowing me to return this POG.I replace these about every two years or about 60 days of camping.  If you use your RV more thanyou may want to replace it more often.  This one is for a 6 gal tank and we have a 10 gal tank.  We did buy one last year for the 10 but it would not fit.
This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.Nice rig but it becomes unhappy and sticks if you use it in cold weather , below 40 sit seems to stick. So if it sticks your back to using it as a tire inflator and using your tire pressure guage again. The entire reason for this thing is to pump air in read it your done. Not the case. If it sticks not you have lost faith in it.This is a pretty simple, cheap compressor.  As others have said, you can take it out of the housing and turn it into a compact compressor that you can store easily.  Especially useful for motorcycles.  Don't try to use it on the battery without turning on the engine though.  You might end up draining your battery.I attach it to a gauge that has a passthrough valve and can check tire pressure and fill up easily before going out for a ride.  Since it's always best to do the tires before you start riding on them, this works out well for me.Accu Gage Air Check Inflate TiresIs the gauge I use
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.
I had given this filter 1 star only for the price however I was able to get this as part of an oil deal at a local auto parts store free.If you get it cheaper than 10 it is an effective filter to use but 10 dollar price just for the filter is unjustifiable IMHO.Compared to Purolator Pure One filters this filter does not provide extra protection but it is double the price of Pure One.Just what it is - brass drain plug.  Normal quality as you would buy in a hardware store if you could find this configuration for this specific purpose.Best choice for the price point research shows penzoil outperforms Mobil 1 in wear test, number one is amsoil but royal purple is a close second and for the money it is number one. Mobil 1 just has excellent marketing it truly is JUNK, but keep buying it if you buy into the marketing lie ; ) .
One side goes to your propane cylinder and other side goes to your regulator.  Make sure you put some pipe dope on the 1/4"  to seal it or yellow gas tape.Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push downTired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.
If you need an off the shelf QD, this is a decent choice, but there are better products available locally.Pros-You can find it anywhere-Almost foolproof to use-Smells niceCons-Doesn't add much shine-Sprayer is too miserly-Not a great value for the $If shopping locally, I'd go for Lucas Slick mist or the Duragloss QD.  For mail order, you are much better off with FK425 or Optimum Instant Detailer.Like is the word and not love.For my 1998 shadow ace vt750c.Requires the original honda spark plug tool due to clearance issues.Improve fuel economy? Nah.Improved performance? Nah.If you find hard enough, their website rated this plugs good to go for 50 000 KM.The denso are better made and packaged. Have a smaller tip and a U groove electrode which can last 30 000KM. But since there is no difference in using a normal and iridium plug for my bike, mileage is more important.Only reason to use this is if your plugs are difficult to get to or you dread spark plug changes.... there are other tools that work just as good, if not better, for half or even less then the price of this.Plain and simple this is a great roller, the rubber head doesn't cut or tear into the foil backing of the sound deadening mat and really helps you put good even pressure to hard to reach areas. That and it saves wear and tear on your hands.But like I said there are cheaper alternatives like a super cheap wallpaper seam roller (you can find some with a rubber or wooden roller) or my personal favoritea "J" roller. With the J roller you can use the roller or even the curved handle to apply pressure to the sound deadening mat. You can even use old roller skate/blade wheels.So to recap:Great toolSaves your hands from a ton of wear and tearWorks greatBUT other tools/items can be had that do the same thing for much less.
I do not know if this is any better than any other but I have 4 of them and have given several as presents. This works on all types of batteries and even my 2009 BMW motorcycle when BMW says it will not.Good productThis product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!Great alternative OEM filter for Lexus LS430's. I've used this filter without any issues. Fits perfect and does not leak.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...
Love this pump. I have use it on re-filling my cars Transmission. works great I am happy with this itemHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.
I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.This is a great product. I use it once per year to clean my fuel system on a 1990 Camry. Still have the original fuel injectors. Do NOT use too much. Follow the directions on the bottle. If you use too much, it will deteriorate plastic and rubber parts in the fuel line. It will also make your car run rough. When I first used this years ago, i made that mistake and called Chevron. The technician at Chevron stated emphatically that you should NOT use more than is recommended on the bottle. In this case,. more is NOT better. When used as directed, it will keep your fuel system clean and your car running great. You can reach Chevron Technical support at 1.800.582.3835Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.To keep plastic water pipes from freezing in winter, this device is used to blow any excess water out the pipes.  Easier to use and cheaper than using marine antifreeze.This item will help keep your battery on full charge,and ready to go all the time, when used properly. Use in conjunction with the extender cord,(will let you park farther from the wall plug).
I bought the Scan Gauge II for one purpose and that was for the transmission temperature gauge for my Silverado. The other option was to replace the dash cluster with one that had the transmission temperature gauge and the Scan Gauge was cheaper by a long shot. Besides having the gauge I was wanting now I've got several others to like the actual water temperature plus the ability to identify and clear engine codes. I've had it on my truck long enough now to say that this is a good product. It works like it's supposed to and unlike a lot of the blue tooth units that transmit the info to the smart phone the Scan Gauge doesn't have to be reprogrammed every time it's turned on from the last time you used it. The Scan Gauge comes back on with the same display every time.This was a perfect oil filter for my Kohler Command Pro 18 HP engine.  I was going to buy the Kohler replacement but several reviewers recommended not to use it as the New Kohler filter has a part that holds the paper internal filter into place is made of plastic and this Purolator filter was recommended.  The Purolator has a metal internal piece just like the original Kohler filters used to have.  I filled the filter with oil to the top and let it soak into the paper internal filter and I oiled the oil filter gasket and installed it.  This is the type of maintenance that your engine just loves.  I ordered it with a bunch of other parts and they all worked fine.  My engine is a Kohler Command Pro 18 HP model CV18SMy favorite hardware store and lawn engine repair shop went out of business as the owner sold the land for a fortune to a large grocery store chain.  I went to Amazon and purchased an air filter, the pre air filter, a new spark plug and an oil filter and went to work.  It runs like a new one again.The prices were better than the local shop I was using and the parts were delivered in 3 days. I didn't have to waste my gasoline to drive anywhere and the items all worked perfectly.Now I am set for the rest of the summer!These wipers were installed on my Prius. I've had it for several years and the original wipers were just not cleaning as they used to.  I was surprised that this small car needed a wiper that was longer than the ones my 4 Runner uses.I'm not sure why, but the larger blade started to leave about 2 to 3 inches smeared in the middle of the blade. I have reinstalled it, used my old trick of diluted vinegar to clean the blade and the windscreen and it still does not do an adequate job. The smaller blade is working fine, but this larger one will definitely need to be replaced before the next few days of inclement weather.
I've been looking to purchase a new Jump pack for use in the shop and narrowed my selection down to either the Clore JNC660 or the Shumacker ProSeries DSR PSJ-2212The reviews were about equal on both so I decided to get the JNC660Well, I just received the JNC660 today and it is defective right out of the box.I plugged it in to charge and the amber led that is suppose to be lit does not indicate it is charging. The Green LED does not show it is fully charged either.I verified my power cord has power from the outlet; even switched to another cord.Disappointed; I guess companies no longer have QC on their products.UPDATE: Feb 04, 2014After realizing that Amazon will not accept returns on this item, I contacted Clore Automotive tech support and explained that I had received a defective jump pack. I reviewed with them the various items I had checked to confirm that it was indeed defective.After they confirmed that I had purchased it via Amazon, they shipped a new JNC660 to me along with a prepaid UPS label to return to them the defective unit. I had the replacement unit in 5 days after contacting them. The replacement unit works great.Clore Automotive gets 5 stars from me for making this disappointing defective unit right.I see that no one has left a review in a while, so they no one may  have ordered for a 2012.I ordered this for my 2012 JK and it does not fit. The circumference for the steering wheel was right but I assume the "thickness" of the steerng wheel has changed as this does not cover the steering wheel correctly (front to back) and I had to remove and return...I shopped around on the internet, and Amazon clearly had the lowest price on this battery (50 dollars cheaper than buying in town - even with a coupon).  I was worried, though, after reading about so many issues with the batteries being delivered damaged or smashed.  Not mine.  Mine was in the original Optima box with HUGE styrofoam protectors surrounding the battery.  The box was extra thick cardboard.  Not only that, but UPS delivered the battery and the box was perfect - really - no dents, no signs of being dropped or mishandled.  And, even better yet is the battery was fresh stock - manufactured in the same month and year that I placed the order.  I am a very happy customer on this purchase.  BTW, when the battery arrived I checked it with my DVM and the voltage was about 12.8 VDC.  I installed it and the car cranked right up!  You can check out my video on how to change this battery on a Suzuki Grand Vitara on YouTube at watch?v=ppqJdzyMZxM&list;=UUSZgIbvZItJr78kHY3Y9wnA&index;=5Update:  after just a bit over a year since installation, the negative terminal started leaking acid.  I wrote to Optima and included my Amazon receipt.  Optima notified Amazon directly to issue me a full refund.  I have used and loved Optima batteries for many years, but feel their quality may have suffered when they moved assembly to Mexico.  I have switched to Odyssey.
I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.One thing about cabin air filter replacement is to make sure you are ready for a &#34;not&#34; so easy task for a Mazda 3. Very intense labor which includes removing a fuse panel and the bracket that it attaches to just to get to the screws that hold the end cap that covers the filters. I would highly recommend TYC brand cabin filters. Their cataloging is correct as well as their instructions. I have used this brand on 2 Nissans and this Mazda 3.
I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.
Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror.I bought this because it comes up when searching for a Cadillac Eldorado 1994 but this blade is too curved.  It stands an inch above the window in the middle the whole way across.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.
Do what as it says and you'll get the results you wanted. don't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint. otherwise, this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxingNeeded for the 2010 Toyota Sienna.  I tried some others and they don't allow you to take off the canister.  This is necessary if you want to change your own oil.Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer.....

I am writing this review after three years of ownership:This is the best digital tire gauge I have ever come across.  This Accutire model came highly recommended from reviewers and that is why I eventually bought it.  It features an easy to read red digital readout that gives accurate 0.5lb increments and the readings take less than a second to register.  The tire valve/gauge seal is great, the rubberized handle easy to grip (even with gloves) and the size fits nicely in a glove compartment.  After three years of nearly monthly readings on all my family's cars, I'm yet to replace the batteries.  This is the third digital gauge I've owned; the first one was worthless trash and the second was ok but not particularly well made or durable.  The third time was a charm with this rugged Accutire model.  I highly recommend this gauge for anyone who checks tires regularly, and it is a good idea to check them regularly for safety, tread wear and gas mileage purposes.I believe the older 2.0L WRX take the Purolator PL14460 filter, but this is the filter for 2.5L WRX and WRX STI.  This is the closest(nearly identical) thing to the OEM Subaru filter.  The textured grip is a nice touch that I have not seen before in a filter.  Good price and easy to buy on Amazon.  I bought four and am happy with my purchase.I have purchased this same model and earlier versions of this gauge for all my cars and my garage. There is one in each car in the door pocket. I also gave one to my father who is 80. The gauge is sturdy, long lasting, accurate, easy to read and hold. It makes an easy tight seal with the valve stem. For low clearance valve stems I use its cousin the, Accutire MS-4710B Motorcycle gauge.
What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!What can I say, it's a funnel.  Does the job as expected. Has a nice large fill hole so the liquids go in quickly.

This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.

Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.

If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.These are a whole lot better than my stock nozzle. Will spray a fan of fluid, it is adjustable and comes with the adjuster key, silver thing in the picture.The only thing I wish was different was being able to adjust the spray higher than what the limit is at now. It is just barely clearing the whipper blade, but the stock one had been so clogged that is wasn't getting above it at all.It is on a ball type adjustment, so all angles and such, just the angle of my hood is the issue, overall, way better and even spread.As high beams are on only when its really dark I liked the increased field of vision how it increased the sides and the length of what I can see.  Yes I would buy them again.
I use only 100% synthetic fluids for my 1990 Toyota Camry which I keep in mint condition since the day I bought it new in 1990. Mobil 1 Extended Performance motor oil. Royal Purple Max ATF Synthetic automatic transmission fluid, Royal Purple fully synthetic Power Steering fluid and Toyota 50/50 Anti-Freeze coolant.I won't give a lesson on why synthetic fluids are far superior to conventional fluids. I've had that argument WAY before auto manufacturers started REQUIRING synthetic fluids right from the factory. They are far superior.In the case of this brake fluid. I've compared all the spec. sheets on all the major brake fluids, and this one meets the highest standards. I just keep is simple with fluids and follow two rules. Change EVERY fluid on your vehicle yearly (more often n the case of the motor oil depending how much you drive) and use the BEST fluids available. THIS is the best brake fluid available.I have used K&N air and oil filters in all of my vehicles for many years.  I do oil peformance and filtration tests through Blackstone-labs and the filters have always worked well and the "nut" on the bottom of the oil filter is very handy.Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

This replacement gas cap solved the &#34;Check Engine&#34; light problem traced to the gas cap or other expensive solution.  I drilled a small hole (carefully) to receive the original retaining line.  I would buy this cap again.This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.
Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!Just what I needed to install two lighter/power sockets under the seat of my motorcycle to power my mobile electronics.I have K&N filters on all my cars and I needed this recharge kit to clean and keep my cars running smooth.  This kit worked great and looking forward in keeping my air filters clean with this kit.
Like I said in the title of this review what more can I say these product are far superior to anything else out there in the market as far as filters go they are number 1 in my book.  The kit comes with enough product for at least 2 cleanings even if you have the large filter just use the product according to the instructions and you are good to go.  Also let the filter dry COMPLETELY before putting the ol back on the filter.If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me.What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know.
If you need an off the shelf QD, this is a decent choice, but there are better products available locally.Pros-You can find it anywhere-Almost foolproof to use-Smells niceCons-Doesn't add much shine-Sprayer is too miserly-Not a great value for the $If shopping locally, I'd go for Lucas Slick mist or the Duragloss QD.  For mail order, you are much better off with FK425 or Optimum Instant Detailer.Like is the word and not love.For my 1998 shadow ace vt750c.Requires the original honda spark plug tool due to clearance issues.Improve fuel economy? Nah.Improved performance? Nah.If you find hard enough, their website rated this plugs good to go for 50 000 KM.The denso are better made and packaged. Have a smaller tip and a U groove electrode which can last 30 000KM. But since there is no difference in using a normal and iridium plug for my bike, mileage is more important.Only reason to use this is if your plugs are difficult to get to or you dread spark plug changes.... there are other tools that work just as good, if not better, for half or even less then the price of this.Plain and simple this is a great roller, the rubber head doesn't cut or tear into the foil backing of the sound deadening mat and really helps you put good even pressure to hard to reach areas. That and it saves wear and tear on your hands.But like I said there are cheaper alternatives like a super cheap wallpaper seam roller (you can find some with a rubber or wooden roller) or my personal favoritea "J" roller. With the J roller you can use the roller or even the curved handle to apply pressure to the sound deadening mat. You can even use old roller skate/blade wheels.So to recap:Great toolSaves your hands from a ton of wear and tearWorks greatBUT other tools/items can be had that do the same thing for much less.
As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.
I bought 2 of these.1 the key works with ease and turns no problem, the other one needs a little fiddling but comes off in less than a second still.Fits the proper 1/2&#34;Comes with a plastic cover to cover the key hole as well.4 stars because I feel they both should operate flawlessly like the better one.bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower.Great little kit that you can get everywhere but, it's Amazon pricing (even less than WallyWorld)This comes with a mounting bracket, don't buy on with it.  The unit is easy to install and is of sufficient quality that I expect it will last a few good years.  Plastic sprung closure of the round, rubber pop cap for the 5er.. I like this on my Tahoe and wiring was just a google away.
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.These seem to be happiest on concrete or hard ground, if the ground is soft or slightly unlevel they bow and will not stabilize the inside of the 5th wheel.Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.
What can be said. RV store in town 3 times the price, Amazon online for the same product is a blast at 1/3 the price. Switches work well, wire solder joints are good and the bulbs were all included. Did the job well, mounted perfectly in a 12 volt powered outdoor shop building and a RV ( I bought a bunch), Soon to buy more.This item appears to be the same as what you'd get from the dealer, only at a fraction of the price.  personally, i like the baking soda odor neutralizing ones better, but this is good also.What you will be getting is Castrol DOT 4 Synthetic oil which you can get at the local auto parts store for half this price.Castrol GT LMA is the old name of the same product. When I called auto part stores for Castrol GT LMA they did not have it because it's the old name they are not familiar with.
If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.
Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.Bought this for our 2003 BMW R 1150R.Even as a female I understand that Mobil 1 is THE standard for synthetic, and we would never buy another brand for any of our engines.Bought a new weight distribution hitch that came equipped with a 2&#34; ball ... I needed a 2-5/16&#34; ball for my larger travel trailer but wanted one with the larger big beefy 1-1/4&#34; shank ... my WD hitch had a hole for that size and NO WAY would I go buy a 2-5/16&#34; ball with a smaller diameter shank and use a spacer in it!I want to best thickest built ball and shank and I could not find a ball this size with this larger shank here locally.Price was great and I love having a big bad boy ball and shank to pull the 5-6K load of my trailer.
I work as a salesman at a car dealership so I had access to a lift.  If you have access, I strongly recommend using a lift vs. jack stands.  I was able to raise and lower my car so I was always painting the calipers from a comfortable standing height and could look at (and paint) the calipers from different angles to make sure I didn't miss anything.The included brush is downright awful -- plan on buying a decent tiny paintbrush for this purpose.The color is a glossy, fire engine red.  At the same time that I was doing this, I also PlastiDipped my rims a bright white (my Grand Am GT coupe is white as well.)  The contrast is striking!There's plenty of paint in this kit -- easily enough to do two sets of calipers.  I gave my remaining paint to the tech who helped me get my car on the lift and showed me how to use the air tools for my wheels.I, like other reviewer, was unable to get a wide enough positioning for the lasers to reach the center dash of both cars. I had to dremel out the surrounds of one of the lasers to get it to go to the right position for my garage ceiling height. Other than that it works fine and is a moderate improvement over the tennis ball method.*Update*After installing this device for a months, we have noticed both lasers are getting pretty dim. A few times I have completely missed seeing them on my dashboard and pulled the car too far. Luckily I use a brick as a safety stop under the tire or else I would have nicked the wall. Short product life.I really took my time and made sure I cleaned my already "clean" bumper with the supplied cleaner to ensure I followed the directions precisely to have the best results.I applied three coats carefully over a period of a weekend (one coat Friday night, a second on Saturday late afternoon and a third Sunday evening).  Overall, I'm quite pleased with the results, though if you are close to the vehicle you can still see some streaking where the product just didn't want to adhere as well as in some areas.  Obviously I can't be certain with independent labratory testing (LOL), I do think my results were more a function of the condition of my bumper at the onset.  It seemed as if some areas of my bumper accepted the polish almost like a sponge....while other areas almost appeared to have wax as the polish sort of smeared and wouldn't apply evenly.Even so, after a third coat I was pleased with the end results.  The bumpers and side trim look like new from any distance greater than 10 feet away.  As I stated, as I get closer you can clearly see some areas that look a little "funny"....but it is still a huge improvement over what they looked like prior.I should note that I used this product on a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee - a vehicle I care very little about in regard to its appearance.  Still, I would recommend it to someone with an older vehicle that is trying to make their vehicle look a little better.  I personally would not use this on a late model vehicle in fear of making it look silly.
I purchased this wheel lock punch for my newly acquired OEM wheel locks i purchased from Amazon. The only thing i hate about this pouch is that it is not made of the material depicted in the picture. It is made out of Nylon.Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some numberThis is a great quality -  made in the USA tire inflator.The ONLY problem I have found is this model does NOT have a deflate feature, the only was to lower the pressure is to raise the chuck up off the stem slightly to allow the air to leak out.
I have used this brand/type thread sealer in many applications from intake bolts, head bolts, and even under the water line on hulls. I`ve never had any issues with removing any hardware using this product! recommend it hands down!Unlike some who had problems with these blades, I think they are the cat's meow-especially when purchased @ Amazon @ discount.... No issues with these at all--wished I have bought them sooner. Highly recommend!Remember to take the clear blade guard off the blade before installing these!Use this with every tankful on my mower and other small machinery that sits around between uses, and haven't had any ethanol related problems (gumming up.) Excellent for winter storage to if you don't want the hassle of draining the carbs, gas tanks whatever.
Camco must make an item for even inconceivable storage problems in your RV.  This is a perfect example of a void that probably did not need to be filled.  And actually, I couldn't find an appropriate mounting location in my travel trailer, so I gave it away.  A cheap lesson learned.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I just got this today, I was amazed the base is perfect for the HI Lift jack, it is a lot bigger than picture shows (12&#34; x 14&#34;) I would highly recommend getting this, it could save your life, or prevent injuries using an unstable jack. &#34;This should come with the jack&#34;. Will last longer than a piece of wood, and is easy to clean.
There are many types of clay out there but this works great on a newer vehicle or one that only needs to be dressed up a bit. Easy to work with and requires little effort. I use a spray lube and have found Mequiars Final Inspection does the job.Make sure the surface is washed before starting.Unless you drop some or have other issues, one bar will be enough for most vehicles. I've been able to do 3 small cars with one of these bars.You could shop all over and play hit or miss for a couple bucks or just do it right the first time.Here's a little hint: EVERY SCION xA & xB can use a cabin filter, and it is a great upgrade to make. It doesn't matter if it came with the option from the factory: every HVAC unit comes with the filter tray. All you have to do is install it.There is only one thing I require for a cabin air filter, and that's the absence of cow dung particulate when traveling along the Central California section of I-5 when it's 110 degrees and hasn't rained in four months.From personal experience, this filter delivers the goods at a great price. It fits the carrier tray perfectly, just make sure you lock the filter's lip into all the tray's plastic snaps. It'll click, so it doesn't require much brain power.I drilled a couple of holes into my toolbox and mounted this to the side of the toolbox.  now my grease gun is always handy and does not take up space in the toolbox.

Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.What I really like about these is the locking bar.  Most inexpensive stands do not have the add safety feature of a locking bar.  These are quality items that make me feel very safe working under a carWhat can we say about this thermostat? It is a Stant. Arguably, the best thermostat available for cars. It was priced right and processed/delivered promptly.
Fits snugly (you don't want it blowing off going down the road) and looks great.  Based on past experience, these covers last about 2-3 years when constantly exposed to sun and rain before the vinyl becomes brittle and small cracks form if handled.This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing.Used this with 1 gallon of distilled water, fill up the rest of my car with 50/50 mix, WOW my car runs cool now! It use to overheat on hot summer days with A/C on, now, the temp gauge actually goes down from time to time! Love it, will use every summer!
would have like to have know that this item was so important in 'most' situations. If you don't have the LynxCap you will likely wish you did have them...Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.These lights are just what they say and if you want good off road driving lights you know you need to spend the bucks.  Wiring was complete and simple, lights worked just like they were suppose too.  I don't plan to be driving off road at night but these are on there just in case.  Like they say you only have to need them once and they paid for themselves.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.
ARB base plate, nice thick plastic, works great.  Essential part of your kit if you carry a Hi-Lift on your truck.good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.Pro's:  Does everything you need at a fraction of the price of DeWalt or other various polishers. Secondly, it seems very heavy duty, I expect to use this machine for years.Con's:  IT'S HEAVY! NEARLY 10lbs! Ok so your saying to yourself that doesn't sound so bad right?  Well after hours of working with it, your arm will become like a noodle.  Secondly, the two backing plates that come standard with it are worthless, throw them away!  Plan on purchasing a Meguiars or a 3M backing plate to pair with this polisher.  I went with Meguiars W68 backing plate but the W66 would be an equally good choice. Another major Con instead of telling you RPM's on the dial which is pretty standard the dial reads 1 2 3 4 so its hard to know exactly what speed your at, wish they had followed their competition on speed selection.Bottom Line: For the price you can overlook every Con.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.As high beams are on only when its really dark I liked the increased field of vision how it increased the sides and the length of what I can see.  Yes I would buy them again.The Meguiar's X2020 are the best bang for the buck, bar none!  What separates them from MOST other microfiber towels is that they are LARGE in size.  Most other microfiber towels, including the popular Zwipes here on Amazon are much smaller so you need 2-3 of them to do what 1 of these X2020's do.  The X2020's are also high quality and remove wax or detailing polish/liquid so smoothly.  The roughly $2 or so price per towel is pricey but b/c of what they do, it's definitely worth it.  Next time Amazon has a sale, i'm loading up on these again.
This is a quality roller and is made in the USA! As long as you use it correctly, it should last a long time.If you're needing to press on this tool really hard, then you're doing something wrong or the sound deadening material you are using doesn't have a good adhesive on it. You should be cutting your material to fit into spaces. You can't just use the roller to make the material go around shapes/contours, that's definitely the wrong approach. Aluminum cannot stretch, so don't assume that sound deadening material with aluminum backing is any different. When rolling, you're adding just enough pressure to make the adhesive stick, and that's it. Over rolling will cause the butyl material to get all over, and if ever think you may want to remove the sound deadener some day, you just made yourself a lot more work.I am using this roller with Thermo-Tec 146xx/147xx series sound deadener. I am sure this roller works well with Dynamat brand sound deander as well. Your luck may vary with some of those generic brands out there that simply relabel ice-guard roof stuff as sound deadener. you know you got ice guard stuff if after 2+ weeks after installing your car smells like asphalt. The ice guard stuff is meant for your roof, it's not something you want inside your car. Anything sold by Amazon.com should be good stuff.All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change.Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.
This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.This thing is ok for out in the open filters, but if you have limited space (ie Harley Filters) there is not enough room for the edges to catch on.  Not a miracle tool at all.Protects you charger and keeps everything in one place. Just enough room and a very fair price. Has a window inside for the instruction sheet.
This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function.This is a good little charger, amazingly small.  Lots of handy features. I appreciate the cord storage, so it makes a neat, uncluttered appearance sitting on the shelf. The only downside ... it's CHINESE ! Never thought there would be any Chinese named Shumacher .... more off-shore sourcing at work.  Mike G.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.Careful you don't drop the adapters when prying the package open (don't ask).  Product seems to fit well but time will tell.Do what as it says and you'll get the results you wanted. don't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint. otherwise, this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxing
Took me awhile to install because I could not find the perfect spot to mount the control box in an 05 Dodge Magnum. I ended up mounting it with velcro between the driver seat and center console, then ran two of the LEDs under the center console to the passenger side and the other two to the driver side.Instead of messing with any power wires, I bought the "Roadpro 12V Fused Replacement Cigarette Lighter Plug with Leads" and used that to power the lights. Working fine so far.As for the lights themselves, here are some pros and cons:Pros:-Nice and bright-Easy to stick some velcro on ends of tubes and stick them on bare metal under the dash and under front seats.-Wires are plenty long-Lots of lighting pattern choices, nearly all of them look great-Love the rainbow-colored fading pattern - matches up perfectly with my aftermarket deck-Wheel on the side of the control box controls how fast or slow the lights fade - a nice touchCons-While having a lot of choices in lighting patterns is good, it can also be a hassle because...-This doesn't come with a remote, which would be much easier to cycle through patterns.-Has turned on by itself a couple times during the day when I don't want it to. I assume this is because I power it through the center console cigarette lighter which is always on. You could easily wire it to a power source that turns on only when the ignition is on (the directions tell you how to do that)Overall, I'm pretty satisfied after a couple days of having these installed. Wish it came with a remote, but I could've paid a few more dollars for the 6pc. Million Color LEDs by LEDGlow that DOES come with a remote.I definitely recommend this product. As long as it lasts me awhile and the LEDs don't start burning out I'll be happy.Doesn't sync up that well with music, even if you turn it up loud.These things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small. they could be a tad bit brighter but they are a fog light which is exactly what i needed. Lights feel well made and sturdy. The wiring harness is very well made. Wire is of good quality and is fairly long however, the load wire that goes from the switch to the relay was not long enough and needed to be extended for my needs. The switch that comes with the kit is really nice and has an LED active light thats red when the lights are off and greeen when the lights are turned on, but i wont be using it.EDIT: CRAP! lights started to leak. seems like the weather stripping inside around the lens is way too big and doesnt seal right. took the lights off my front bumper and put them on my rear bumper to use as reverse lights since they didnt give me the light output desired. after almost of week of being on my rear bumper they filled up completely with water even worse than they did on my front bumper and one lens also cracked. going to contact the company or seller to see if i can get a replacement lens. READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING. THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT THE GREATEST.Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right.
These are a whole lot better than my stock nozzle. Will spray a fan of fluid, it is adjustable and comes with the adjuster key, silver thing in the picture.The only thing I wish was different was being able to adjust the spray higher than what the limit is at now. It is just barely clearing the whipper blade, but the stock one had been so clogged that is wasn't getting above it at all.It is on a ball type adjustment, so all angles and such, just the angle of my hood is the issue, overall, way better and even spread.The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?I wanted a 130-amp load tester because--at least per the manufacturers' claims--these units are more accurate than 100-amp models.  The OTC 3181 looks exactly like the Actron CP7614 (except for brand markings on the front), but is far less expensive.The OTC 3182 is a digital 130-amp load tester for just a bit more money than this OTC 3181, and it has a couple more features (an alternator test lead and a ripple detection light), but I tend to have better luck with analog products over digital products, in terms of reliability. Also, when you use the OTC 3182, it shows you just a number (the voltage reading), and you're on your own to interpret it. The OTC 3181, on the other hand, has "replace/weak/good" markings (in red/yellow/green), which make it very easy to interpret the results, without having to remember or think about what voltage range is acceptable during testing.I was a little surprised at the size of the unit when I opened the box.  It's a bit large!  The clamps are large and strong.  The overall feel is quality.When testing a battery (unless it's a totally dead battery), the unit will heat up very significantly.  Through the vent holes in the unit, you can actually see metal coils getting red hot, like little heater elements.  That's how the load is applied--in the form of heat.Testing is easy: With the vehicle and the key both off, attach the negative clamp to the negative post of the battery, then attach the positive clamp to the positive post of the battery.  (People with mechanical experience may think this is backwards, since you normally attach the positive clamp first.  I assure you, I am quoting the manufacturer here on the order advised.)  Press and hold the rocker switch for 10 seconds, and then quickly look at the needle while still holding the switch down.  (They advise against holding the rocker switch for more than 15 seconds.) To test the charging system, begin with the clamps attached as described above, then start the car and run it at 1,200 - 1,500 RPM, and read the needle.  Remove the positive clamp, and then the negative.When I was choosing a load tester, I kept reading about "zero adjust" features.  I didn't know what that meant.  Now that I have a unit in hand, I can see that it refers to a little screw in the face of the unit; turning this screw one way or the other (with the clamps not connected to anything!) allows you to adjust the needle so that it is accurately zeroed.  That's all.
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon.This kit is great! The LEDs are very bright at night and all the colors look good.The music pulse feature is lacking but I didn't expect much from it.
If you want this in chrome type the letter C infront of it in your search.  I love the welded nut option it is a life saver for motorcycles or small engine bays.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Needed to check a sea doo. Bright enough to see in normal light and confirm spark.You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.Nice product, claims not to damage pressure senders, seems to be effective if puncture is in the tread.  Does not claim to work on sidewalls.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.

you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech.The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display. Yes, a little air does escape but my unit was always able to make a good seal in a fraction of a second. For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear. I can't think of a practical use for the 'flashlight' feature - it stays on only while the power button is pressed - but there may come a day I will be grateful it was there.I find this gage to perform well and, so far, I was able to operate it without any trouble. I understand that it's possible to perform the exact same readings with a near-free 'analog' gauge but I believe that the added precision and convenience are worth this item's price. However, I will take out one star and rate this gauge as a 4-star mainly for the somewhat misleading '5-year warranty' claim, prominently displayed on the packaging. Given that 'in real life' the customer would pay more for shipping back and forth than it would cost to purchase a brand-new unit the warranty promise, whether 5-year or double-lifetime as quite meaningless.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.for some reason it listed for my application,but it was for a newer vehicle so it did not work for me ,i gave it to my aunty and it worked perfectly.Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel.  The kit was perfect and the tools were decent.  My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made.  Global economy or whatever, when I'm looking for quality tools, I'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices.  Sure, these are better than Harbor Freight, but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.But that is a rant to have another day, and I can point you towards a better kit for now.  So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA.Product arrived on-time from amazon. Purchased this for an old motorcycle that I was tired of swapping chargers with.  I opted to give this one a try because of all the positive reviews.  This charger is just a poorly made product.  Even though is was $20, and less than other brands I have purchased, I think it is a waste of money. First, it says it is for agm batteries, but only charges a battery at 14.3v.  Agm's need a higher voltage than this (in fact all batteries need a higher voltage than this). Second, it would not bring my battery up to a full charge. Lastly, the charger runs really hot, so I was afraid to leave this connected for a long period of time. Frustrated, I decided to open up the charger, and to my surprise, all there is is a transformer and a diode.  For a transformer in a box, I should have paid a lot less.First I must say I hate purchasing tools that only do one thing...(uni-tasker).  I purchased this socket tool, becouse I had to.  Not becase I wanted to, but quickly found out I need another socket to turn it... and here's the kicker.  The socket is bigger then standard set 19mm or 3/4!  So you have go out and purchase a 15/16 or 24mm socket, which is a huge socket.  I will never use this socket unless I own a diesel truck.  Add that to the cost of the wrench. So about 8 dollars for the socket and the price of tool, just to get started.  The oil filter wasn't on too tight, so the cheaper plastic tool worked out just fine for me.  The 24mm socket stays on the aluminum tool and should ship like that.  Waste of time and money for a tool that only does one task....
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.Great hydraulic oil. Quality comes in an entire package. This includes the container, the pouring spout and the way the spout can be retracted with the cap on for storage. One can is enough to flush and refill the entire power steering unit.j After changing the fluid, my power steering is noticeable smoother and quieter. Very pleased with the performance of the product.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.
I got my rv level and checked it using bubble levelers in several locations. Once it was for sure completely level I put these on the front by my electric tounge jack where I can see them when I am leveling the trailer. one is positioned for the side to side level and one is positioned for the up and down front and back level.They work great. I cleaned the area really good with alcohol and used the adhesive backers they came with.You can drill holes and screw them on but I do not like drilling holes if I do not have to.They have been on there for some time now and if they start coming off I will just get some 3m command strips or just get new ones since they are not that expensive.These looked descent when put up in my travel trailer but where on the floor the next day ... then on the floor the day after. the double sided tape sucks on these and needs a more heavy duty industrial type hold double sided tape.When put up you can see the white double sided tape form the side and it looks a bit ugly.Not impressed at all and bought different organizers from camping world that look WAY better and hold perfectly and are flush.Was past my 30 days return so I sold these on eBay for a few bucks ... lost 90% of my original purchase price!I would never buy these again.But all depending on the surface and for the price I guess they would okay for some if they would hold.Not for me and my trailer though.I mounted one of these levels on the side and the other on the front of my camper where I can see both at the same time. Makes leveling the fifth wheel a snap. They are held in place by adhesive strips. Just make extra sure that your camper is level when you mount them in place. The only reason that I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is because the green has faded to a yellow in the bright sun, but it still works fine.
This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.What else can you ask for? 3 Ton and light weight plus locking mechanism is way safer than the wedge cuts in regular ramps.I suggest that they cover the top with a rubber pad or silicon piece to help protect car and standwith plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal.
These replaced the stock beep horns on my 03 Maxima. They bolt straight in, and I needed to tweak the position of the horn a bit due to short leads from the car. I did not need to do any rewiring. Package comes with the relay, but did not need it. Luckily the awful red covers and silver grilles pop off easily. You do need a high and low tone horn to get the proper sound. These are good horns for $17, but still not as penetrative as my BMW's. Overall, happy.I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy!Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack.
I bought these cause the price seemed good.They chatter unless its pouring out I wont get them again for sure. If you want good wipers get the Rainx lattitudes or Trico Neoform they are both superior to Bosch crap..These lights are just what they say and if you want good off road driving lights you know you need to spend the bucks.  Wiring was complete and simple, lights worked just like they were suppose too.  I don't plan to be driving off road at night but these are on there just in case.  Like they say you only have to need them once and they paid for themselves.I truly don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. Take the guess work outta knowing weather your tires need replacing or will pass inspection. Can't go wrong with this one.
While I see these as a good product and they do serve a very nice purpose but they are also limiting at the same time.Do they soak stuff up.. YesAre they durable.. YesAre they convenient.. yesWell what's the problem?It's the fact that you have to get them nearly soaked before you can unpack/unfold them. it seems like they are just compressed into a form and allowed to dry. You can't just get them damn and start unfolding them. Makes it pain if you don't have a bottle of water handy...On the other hand though, they do stand up to some decent abuse and I do keep a pack in the car as well as a in my camera bag and luggage. you never know when you are going to need something like this and they are small enough to simply just cut a strip or 2 or 5 and leave in a bag.also keep in mind that these aren't "towels" as we would normally think of a towel, they are more very thin cloths. not really towels...Will I buy these again:I don't really know... Depends on if I find them truly useful by the time I run out of them. I've only use a couple of them to date. So we will see how it goes.If you have ever cut a filter open so see how it's made, you need to see these to appreciate the quality. I find they are the best and I am running two &#34;Cobra&#34; engines.I needed some new bulbs for my Hella H1 headlights since I made the switch from the generic sealed beams on my E30 to some German made headlights that have a way better lighting pattern (even though they are not DOT legal, hehehe). These are good, reasonably priced bulbs that will suit your headlight bulb needs. They aren't as bright as the high performace Xenon bulbs, but they will light up the road enough for you to see it. So if you want to get some H1's but don't want to break the bank or pay dealer prices, get them here from Amazon.
It's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it.Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them.For long term accuracy you will have to screw these to your RV. Or you can buy a carpenters level on Amazon and place it on the Floor of your RV to check it for level.
Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j
I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon.I like the Junior and just let it sit and charge. The green LED light stays on and lets you know the battery is 100%. No issues. I like that it comes with two sets of cables.I have been using an old fashioned test light for years. This product can replace the old style test light and has many more uses. It has all the adapters you need and the power applied by the unit is a life saver. The LED light is bright enough for most work.

At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display.

So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display. Yes, a little air does escape but my unit was always able to make a good seal in a fraction of a second. For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear. I can't think of a practical use for the 'flashlight' feature - it stays on only while the power button is pressed - but there may come a day I will be grateful it was there.I find this gage to perform well and, so far, I was able to operate it without any trouble. I understand that it's possible to perform the exact same readings with a near-free 'analog' gauge but I believe that the added precision and convenience are worth this item's price. However, I will take out one star and rate this gauge as a 4-star mainly for the somewhat misleading '5-year warranty' claim, prominently displayed on the packaging. Given that 'in real life' the customer would pay more for shipping back and forth than it would cost to purchase a brand-new unit the warranty promise, whether 5-year or double-lifetime as quite meaningless.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.for some reason it listed for my application,but it was for a newer vehicle so it did not work for me ,i gave it to my aunty and it worked perfectly.Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.

Why didn't I think of this years ago? I have been using McGard wheel locks exclusively for 30+ years and I usually wrap the lock key in either a shop paper towel or a rag and put in the center console or with the spare. Either way I have doing the 'cheap' version of this and this just makes SO much sense for keeping the wheel lock key in an identifiable location. Bought two (2), one for each vehicle.We have tested a few chargers for fleet use - this being the best one I tested.I have a fleet of Ford E250 vans, mostly 2004, 2006-2008 models.  I have jumped at least 10 vans with this on a single charge.  The 10th van had zero juice in the battery (not enough to even dimmly power the cab light or even get a flicker on the dash), and it fired right up without any charge time.My ONLY complain is the charger leads do not grip well onto GM side post batteries (we have some '02 and '04 GMC 2500 vans as well).  It works but you have to work to make a connection.This jumps far better than some other brands we have tried and I am recommending that we purchase several more for our fleet.Just received my 2nd unit (for emergency backup).  First off, the first one I have is similar to the other photo that a customer posted here, that contain the "white grip guards".  The NEWER models do not have the white covers because the teeth of the grips are recessed (per customer service technical support), and can't make contact with metal or anything to short them out.  I purchased my first unit this summer, and now the new models are out with the upgraded recessed grips. Personally, I still like the one with the grip covers, mainly because I know for a fact they are covered. I'll probably place some small kiddie size cups on them to reduce my paranoia :)I have one I leave in my diesel truck, and the 2nd one I keep in my RV for using as backup power via 12 volt socket.  I haven't used any of these units yet to jumpstart my vehicle or anyone else's but I like how easy it is to charge this units, and the fact your can easily use it to power 110 volt equipment using an inverter.  Very versatile, and a good display reading on the front showing the voltage is a plus.  Nice compact unit, and doesn't weigh a lot.Wouldn't be without them!
I would say the claim of 51 watts equaling 115 watts is just not true! Based on the claim I figured these bulbs would just blow away my Sylvania Ultra Stars. Put the PIAA in one light and compared to the Sylvannia left in the other. Against my white garage door, I saw no visible difference in light output at all! Drove the truck and no difference. Color is only a very slightly different shade of white. I am not knocking PIAA as I know they do make quality products, but the claim is misleading.Installed in a 2007 Camry Hybrid.  However, when I close the lid, I do see a bit of the white cover on the left but Fram says this is the correct part.  Did not notice any improvements in performance, but cheaper than OEM.I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers.
Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltageAfter a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operationAt less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet.
Fits my 2006 Honda Civic EX perfectly.  There's an arrow on one side of the filter, indicating direction of air-flow, which you match up to the arrow on the air-filter frame.  Love the convenience of not having to go to the dealer, or even the auto-parts store.I double checked Amazon's part recommendation for my car against FRAM's website before ordering, and Amazon's recommendation was accurate.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.On comparing these 'Ultra' bulbs with the base Silverstars that preceded them:  The base (blue pak) Silverstar is a much better light, IMHO.  I actually went back to the base Silverstar for what appeared to be its superior illumination down the road that I experienced with both our '03 Honda Civic (HB2) and '03 Focus (same bulb, but 9003/H4 designated).  Felt a bit 'scammed' by this newer 'Ultra' offering really.  And, it's true; 6 mos 'tops' for 'life' in both cars but.. wouldn't be without.Bill H. in the Pacific Northwest - rain country!
Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock "beep-beep" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud.

So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display. Yes, a little air does escape but my unit was always able to make a good seal in a fraction of a second. For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear. I can't think of a practical use for the 'flashlight' feature - it stays on only while the power button is pressed - but there may come a day I will be grateful it was there.I find this gage to perform well and, so far, I was able to operate it without any trouble. I understand that it's possible to perform the exact same readings with a near-free 'analog' gauge but I believe that the added precision and convenience are worth this item's price. However, I will take out one star and rate this gauge as a 4-star mainly for the somewhat misleading '5-year warranty' claim, prominently displayed on the packaging. Given that 'in real life' the customer would pay more for shipping back and forth than it would cost to purchase a brand-new unit the warranty promise, whether 5-year or double-lifetime as quite meaningless.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.for some reason it listed for my application,but it was for a newer vehicle so it did not work for me ,i gave it to my aunty and it worked perfectly.Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.

Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.for some reason it listed for my application,but it was for a newer vehicle so it did not work for me ,i gave it to my aunty and it worked perfectly.Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.If you decide to get this I also rcomend you get some lengths of gutter, at least 2 pieces, you can lay in on the expanded matrix so the gutter hose will not fall between the expanded sectiond.  So this and you have a great working system.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.
This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing.this stuff is amazing, works perfectly, Gas stays very functional all winter, in the boat, Lawn mower, and i use it in the snow blower over the summer.  fantasticoThis car wash cleaned the car very well,but it left water spots. To be fair the car was in the sun and I was talking to someone while I was drying.It was about 75 degrees outside that day and sunny. I washed silver,blue,red and grey colored cars with no problem.I live in NYC and the water is not that hard.A little goes a long way and its very foamy.Works well in the foam gun.Just dry it quickly if your car is black.Otherwise 5 stars!
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
Considering these stands cost about four times as much as a lot of others, and considering the five star reviews, I was expecting perfection.  Unfortunately, they have design flaws.First, the packing sucks.  Two stands come packed together in one box with bits of cardboard that are supposed to prevent the two stands and the two separated stand arms from rubbing together.  I'm not sure if they scraped through the cardboard or if it just shifted, but all of my stands have scrapes on them and in one place the metal is rusting where the paint was scraped.  The manual says if you see rust to scrape it off and repaint it.  I shouldn't have to do that when they're new due to bad packing.  Also, the scrapes reveal just how imperceptibly thin the paint actually is.The description says "Formed base adds stability and helps reduce sinkage into pavement".  When I think "formed base" I think formed as one solid piece.  Instead, the base has tiny triangles of metal welded to the _inside_ of each foot.  Then they carefully take a picture of the stand so you can't see what they did till you get it.  That would still be acceptable except they made no effort to level either the feet or the triangles.  On many of the feet, the triangle sits too deep in the foot so it wouldn't even touch the pavement until the foot edge had dug into the pavement.  In other cases, an edge of a crooked triangle will form a divot in the pavement before the rest of the foot or triangle touches ground.  They could have splurged for a tiny bit more metal to make the triangles large enough to rest the edge of each foot on the triangle, then set the whole thing on a flat surface while the triangles were welded.  I've seen other stands with that design.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the arm that locks the stands at a particular height doesn't move very far and so it's hard to tell by looking if the lock is engaged.  I agree this is a problem and I wish the teeth were deeper so it was easier to tell when a locking arm was fully engaged.  However, it's probably not really an issue because the weight of the yellow bar and the shape of the teeth and locking bar will force the locking bar to fully engage.  Even if the locking bar is rusty enough to prevent the weight of the yellow bar from fully locking it, the weight of the car certainly will.  I could possibly imagine a case where the tip of the locking bar is barely touching a tooth of the yellow bar and putting weight on the yellow could cause a failure, but I couldn't get it to sit like that when trying, so it's pretty unlikely.  However, as the jacks get rusty and teeth possibly wear, or if you simply get one with a small manufacturing defect, such a situation could become more likely.  So I'm not a fan of this design where locking can't easily be confirmed visually.  Even if they had made it so the locking arm sits perfectly horizontal while locked and an inch off horizontal when unlocked it would have been better.While doing my tests with the locking bar I created quite a bit of shaved yellow paint particles just from moving the yellow bar up and down by hand.  This is probably typical of the paint used on jack stands and maybe there's no avoiding it, but it certainly doesn't seem that they used any sort of premium paint.  The coating of yellow paint does seem to be thicker than the coating of blue paint, at least.I don't think the description (or the 3-ton label on each stand) makes it very clear that the 3 ton rating is per PAIR, not per stand.  You have to read the manual to find that out.  They also have big warnings in two places in the manual not to put a car on four stands.  Since it's fairly common for people to put cars onto four jack stands, I don't know if that warning is just there to cover their butts in case someone lifts a car wrong onto four stands and it falls over during lifting or if there's something about these particular stands that makes them bad for using four at once.  Perhaps the bases are just too small.  Of course, using four stands in earthquake country is just asking for trouble so that could be another reason.In case anyone was wondering, these stands only lock at a particular position.  Just because the description says "ratchet" doesn't mean you can ratchet them up while the car's weight is on them.  If you manage to move the locking bar with the car's weight on the stand (which actually shouldn't be possible due to the shape of the teeth), the stand will collapse to its lowest level.The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too.
As the title says, this accessory is worth getting with the jack. It secures the handle firmly and eliminates any vibration between the two.This thing is pretty basic. You essentially create a girth hitch with it. You pass the strap around an object, then you take the standing part of the strap and grab a loop of it and pass it through the sewn loop at the tag end of the strap. Then you slide this thing between the standing part and the sewn loop, and when you tighten the strap, the bone prevents the standing part from sliding back through the sewn loop, essentially creating a knot. Any sailer will be familiar with this system it's used alot in quick release knots.You have to have this. Mounts most typically on the outside of the RV.. Just tilt the outside door/vent open and Olsen the peacock valve. No tools required!  Very cool!
i recommend it to everyone who has a hi lift jack or something like, to buy this product. it fits very snug, hard to fall off. it does exactly what it is suppose to.I'm sure this product will do what it needs to do.  It's difficult for this product to really screw up what it's intended purpose is.  I use it to put on spark plugs and wheel lug nuts so they don't seize up and become impossible to remove.Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...ok, if you read the reviews, you will see lots of "oh the cord is so long, it has to run by the brake pedals, its not 100% accurate" blah blah wah wah. This device simply reads and displays what the vehicles computer is showing. is anything 100% accurate? hardly. but it does a good job. for the people who say its not helping my mpg, are u kidding? this device does not have anything to do with CONTROLLING your mpgs, your FOOT does! the only way this helps is as a reminder that if you drive like an idiot, u use more gas. if u need a computer to tell u that, dont drive! yes the cord routes by the pedals, thats where OBD ports are. not everything in the world can be bluetooth, deal with it. use a little common sense and route the cord. this thing is handy, and works as advertised. only reason im taking a star away, is that it is a little expensive for what it is, however, with my luck, now that ive bought it, the price will drop. overall a great gadget, that can be saved and used on any future vehicles i may buy.EDIT/UPDATE:  after using the gauge a few different ways now, ive found the average mpg very helpful. it really makes you realize the best way to increase mpg. i thought before if i grandma the pedal always it wud help, takes more than that.
I'm not shocked that there were no wires, even though the picture shows wires.  But I am surprised that the dust cover - which appears to be integral in the picture - is not included.  All that's in the package is the clamp itself and some self-drilling sheetmetal screws.  Maybe I'll check back some day and see that the picture has been changed or the description has been updated to reflect reality, in which case I'll change the number of stars.  But for now, I'm knocking two stars off for the deceptive ad, and another star for the product really being a fairly cheap piece.  In my opinion, the piece isn't a great value; the price is at best only "fair".  And yeah, I know, we're not reviewing prices.  But it's a cheaply-made product which lacks finish; I think the bottom side could've been solid instead of having the exposed ribbing, and I think the included screws (which appear to at least be stainless) should've come with appropriately-sized washers to distribute the load on the plastic.Installed in a 2007 Camry Hybrid.  However, when I close the lid, I do see a bit of the white cover on the left but Fram says this is the correct part.  Did not notice any improvements in performance, but cheaper than OEM.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.Bought this for my 2005 325it Sportswagon.  It looks exactly like the one I bought from BMW for a third less.  The only thing missing on this filter is the BMW roundel.I use this exact filter on my 05 Honda Silver Wing. Honda recomends Torqing the filter. And the 17mm Nut makes it easy. Bought the bike used with about 2k miles. Rode 1500 miles and my oil is still clean. This is a Heavy filter for its size. Due to the steel case.
The last time I drained my gray water tank on my trailer, I sort of cross threaded the cap and busted off on the the tabs, making the cap unusable.This is a great replacement and I like the fact that I can attach a hose to the cap to drain my gray water tank into a container, or if I am boondocking/dry camping, I can just run the hose away from my trailer to drain the sink water!I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chockedVery useful and precise. Even my mechanic asked me to order one for him. Beats opening the hood or even worse on my car, the battery is in the trunk under the floor. A pain to access if you have the optional rubber mat to protect the trunk floor.
The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.This strainer works, but can't fit even full size plates! It also is very flimsy. I would find another one!This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates.  I'm happy.  It doesn't fit all cars.  Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight!!
I originally bought this item to power my laptop or any cellphones on long trips. i could have bought the 200w version or a cheaper power inverter, but i got the 400w as i always like to prepare for the unexpected, and it turns out i can watch a dvd on a nice TV in the trunk of my suv when i go BBQ.Pros:- the blue aluminum outer case provides a great heat dispersion medium, you can tell, touch it after its been running for 5-10 mins-it isnt too loud with the fan on- it HAS a fan- shuts off when car battery is too low- and the most important: provides alot of power for most application needs.Cons: -a bit bulky, however, i was able to stash it under the trunk storage- a little more expensive too but you get what you pay for.ALSO!!! becareful when using with your cig adpater, as it will probably burn your fuse. If you are hooking high amp appliances, connect directly to the battery._____update: Oct. 9, 2010After a while of using this, i still continue to like it more and more, it has yet to fail me, and provides energy to quite the array of power draining devices i have. You will NOT regret this, i come up with new ways to utilize this all the time, ever play mini portable air hockey on a camping trip?i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceI have had several of these items . I like to have a inverter with a tire pump . Cost was a big factor for me in my younger days . However I now carry this , and a separate air pump that has battery clamps by viar . I am much happier and simply use my generator or a 12 volt led lamp . I used this during the past winter 4 or 5 times to jump start my van with a 351 and it cranked right up from dead after sitting and the charger coming undone . It barely took a charge this spring after I went to charge it after neglecting to do so all winter using it . This will never let you down . I believe it will last years and I love having one in each vehicle for the safety as well as to help others at church or the store that are less fortunate . A great investment and safety item for any family . Pay the extra you will be very happy if starting cars is your main need . Use a viair air pump and buy a battery clip one attachment into a 12 volt plug which will give you the leangh to go around your vehicle and will fill your tires in less then a minute . Do not use the 12 volt outlet for the viair air pump  it can't handle the amps in most cars . This pack is limited to 12 amps output so do not try to  use it either for the air pump unless it is a life and death emergency . When you use those air pumps you need to go off the battery with the car running . Be careful watch where the cord is with the moving parts .
clear instructions-easy to use and increased the miles per gallon on both of our vehicles by about 2mpg. Will buy again.this piece fits on the battery on your car/truck/bike and connects to cable from battery tender, have this on all my equipt,toys for quick hook up.I bought these for my 2003 Tahoe,hard to believe but both front windows failed on the same day.check out the video on Youtube for your model car.buy a can of silicone & spray all your window channels,door locks & hindges when you are doing the job.
this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.
This tool requires the use of anti-sieze compound when chasing the threads.  Doing this gets the rust and crud out of the threads.  This is a must for proper seating and sealing of the O2 sensor.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.
Ok I think this is way overpriced for the product you buying, it's defiantly overpriced, and it's basically just a bag and it's not attachable to nothing so yes you can place your locking Kay in there but where can you place it if it's not attachable to nothingStandard anti-seize lubricant.  Messy to get on your fingers, but does what its supposed to do.  No complaints.  Like the small size because I don't really use it that often.Yes it is a water magnet;however like another reviewer said, it's so magnetic where it won't let the water go no matter however many times you wring it. Sure drops will come off, but the potency of drying will not be at 100% as if the towel was completely dry. I would recommend a chamois or an absorber, they seems to wring out water alot better as well as soak water up. Just figure out a technique. And victory will be yours. So the case of the drying water magnet, I'll give it a four since it does what it's title says. And a bit easier to use than the chamois. But you get what you pay for.
Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far.I used this charger once only on an Optima battery (AGM) and it performed flawlessly. I set it on 10amp it charged it fully saying it was on 10amp but it had swiched to 2amp for final charge which is how a fully automatic charger is supposed to work. When the charged light came on my Kline multimeter says the Optima is fully charged. If it didn't I would send it back to Amazon, which is how you are instructed to handle an issue like that, and they will deal with Optima. I also love the size of this charger. It is very small, and light, and easy to use. Another good experience from Amazon.
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.I use this in our travel trailer. It's a good fit on the counter, but the stand needs to be a bit taller to be able to slope the water toward the sink, so I end up propping the end up a bit. I don't use it for storing since it's an open grate on the bottom and don't want to chance spilling any detergent or soap during transit.Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.
I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom.  On some vehicles with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless.
I use it for applying polish. Works great. I used it for about 6 uses then it wore out. I suppose I could have gotten another one out of it. The too I think I was pushing on it a little too hard so it would probably last a little longer. I bought more of them. I'm new to using a polisher to wax a car so I'm not really one to rate this but its the best ( and only) one I've ever used.I bought this as a extra , so that when I change the oil I will have a new one.  It look to be of great quality and I am sure it will work just fine.i bought this to replace my trusty c-clamp and it works nice and fast too but i think i might spring for the better model that looks like a caulking gun
I bought this to compare to my favorite one. I can't see any differance? So give it a try. Costs a little less too.  SWHaven't had a chance to use this grease gun but It looks to be perfect for the application I need it for.  It looks like it will be able to shoot lube up in some real tight places.  I am really excited to use this but I think I will stop before i get too graphic.  I am batmanI use it for applying polish. Works great. I used it for about 6 uses then it wore out.

Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.Best Full Synthetic motor oil you can buy next to AMSOIL or Redline.  If you want to do your own research, visit [...] and you can learn a lot.Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!
good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.ok, if you read the reviews, you will see lots of "oh the cord is so long, it has to run by the brake pedals, its not 100% accurate" blah blah wah wah. This device simply reads and displays what the vehicles computer is showing. is anything 100% accurate? hardly. but it does a good job. for the people who say its not helping my mpg, are u kidding? this device does not have anything to do with CONTROLLING your mpgs, your FOOT does! the only way this helps is as a reminder that if you drive like an idiot, u use more gas. if u need a computer to tell u that, dont drive! yes the cord routes by the pedals, thats where OBD ports are. not everything in the world can be bluetooth, deal with it. use a little common sense and route the cord. this thing is handy, and works as advertised. only reason im taking a star away, is that it is a little expensive for what it is, however, with my luck, now that ive bought it, the price will drop. overall a great gadget, that can be saved and used on any future vehicles i may buy.EDIT/UPDATE:  after using the gauge a few different ways now, ive found the average mpg very helpful. it really makes you realize the best way to increase mpg. i thought before if i grandma the pedal always it wud help, takes more than that.while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.Hooked this up to the battery under my motorcycle seat making it really easy to connect to a trickle charger

After observing that my Radio Shack test leads don't conduct electricity very well, I decided to upgrade to this set. Generally I have been happy with my purchase but the large number of small parts is a concern. Extech provides tiny dust caps for many of the conductive surfaces, which should improve their longevity. While these are a nice touch, they are likely to get lost.  Additionally, the base cables are separate from the probes and clips, creating 12 separate parts.  Adding the slim reach test probes, which would be purchased separately, there will be a total of 14 items in the case.It would take a longer time period to truly evaluate this product as the corrosion resistance of the surfaces along with the durability of the PVC cables will be the key indicators of value. Meanwhile, the cables and probes appear to be well made.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the flared design of the main probes can be less than ideal in tight spaces.  So, you might want to consider purchasing the Extech TL743 Slim Reach Test Probe Set at the same time.  Note the term "set" in the case of the slim reach test probe set is a bit misleading because there are only two probes without case or cables.  They will fit nicely in the existing case.The Extech TL809 Electronic Test Lead Kit is a solid value.  There is some room for improvement, such as integrated caps, but this would most likely come with an increase in expense and some additional limitations.  For no additional expense, Extech should include the slim leads in the base kit and make the flared probes optional.  At this price point, this lead set is highly recommended.ProsNice carrying caseComes with probes, alligator clips and plunger mini-hooksDust caps on conductor surfacesConsToo many small partsFlared test probes too wide for some applicationsThere is no swiveling between the cap, the tube and the bottle. In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each. I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem.I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns!
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.
Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some numberthis hose feels really sturdy, used it to fix old boat (sold it though), fix transmission and steering lines in cars. this is high quality hose, made in USAThe jug came with a seal which is intact.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt the quality of a product that is in a sealed container and that is labeled as it was marketed.
Doesn't add too much of a shine on the surfaces you apply it on, its just right and leaves a clean/streak free finish.  I use this on the non-leather surfaces in my car and on the black trim on the outside of my carUsed this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.This has a lot of uses beyond car applications. I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound. I used a sheet of it inside a computer case, to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on. You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess. It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover, and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind. So, choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down!
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation. Great valuie.
Great for working with metals and woods if you want a real fine and smooth finish. So get some and get sanding.Purchased this to replace missing cap on RV.  Works as expectedbut would like to see bigger nubs or perhaps 2 wings to makethis a little easier to put on and remove.Great accessory for when you get stuck and need to lift just one wheel to perform a self recovery to get back on the trail/street.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech.The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display. Yes, a little air does escape but my unit was always able to make a good seal in a fraction of a second. For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear. I can't think of a practical use for the 'flashlight' feature - it stays on only while the power button is pressed - but there may come a day I will be grateful it was there.I find this gage to perform well and, so far, I was able to operate it without any trouble. I understand that it's possible to perform the exact same readings with a near-free 'analog' gauge but I believe that the added precision and convenience are worth this item's price. However, I will take out one star and rate this gauge as a 4-star mainly for the somewhat misleading '5-year warranty' claim, prominently displayed on the packaging. Given that 'in real life' the customer would pay more for shipping back and forth than it would cost to purchase a brand-new unit the warranty promise, whether 5-year or double-lifetime as quite meaningless.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.for some reason it listed for my application,but it was for a newer vehicle so it did not work for me ,i gave it to my aunty and it worked perfectly.Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......Will last for a long time. A great price. This is really something that will extend the life of any gas powered engine. Use the blue which is better than the pink. Remember you get what you pay for.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.
You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.Keeps my battery charged and easy to hook up. Just connect either the alligator clips or the ring terminals and plug the unit into the wall and you're done! This unit is very simple a single LED tells you the status of the charge/battery. For the price can't go wrong and it's nice to know that when you go to start up whatever it is, you can count on it.This is a pretty simple, cheap compressor.  As others have said, you can take it out of the housing and turn it into a compact compressor that you can store easily.  Especially useful for motorcycles.  Don't try to use it on the battery without turning on the engine though.  You might end up draining your battery.I attach it to a gauge that has a passthrough valve and can check tire pressure and fill up easily before going out for a ride.  Since it's always best to do the tires before you start riding on them, this works out well for me.Accu Gage Air Check Inflate TiresIs the gauge I use
There are many other products like the ctech but this is clearly one of the highest quality. The best part is there are optional wires that fit many needs or if you have multiple vehicles.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletNot much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.
First of all, the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second, once the car is started, you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display, indicating that a charge is occurring. However, this is a static icon, it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom. And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery. For this you need accurate readings, and I can not see these on this unit.It is a battery in a box that will help you jump start vehicles.  Love the plug and leave it charging.  This unit, at least the one I got, has the built in self charger that will not allow over charging of the battery.  I also like the fact it does not have all the gadgets the other unit out there have.  They filled the space in this unit with a bigger battery!!Here's a little hint: EVERY SCION xA & xB can use a cabin filter, and it is a great upgrade to make. It doesn't matter if it came with the option from the factory: every HVAC unit comes with the filter tray. All you have to do is install it.There is only one thing I require for a cabin air filter, and that's the absence of cow dung particulate when traveling along the Central California section of I-5 when it's 110 degrees and hasn't rained in four months.From personal experience, this filter delivers the goods at a great price. It fits the carrier tray perfectly, just make sure you lock the filter's lip into all the tray's plastic snaps. It'll click, so it doesn't require much brain power.
This scanner does the work it is intended to. And it seems it has to be installed in the car to enjoy it's benefits. But the tip of the cable connection got broken and one has to order another cable.... seems like a common issue from previous reviewsThe only problem I have with this seat is one of the wheels sticks and does not swivel as it should.I could have sent it back but decided it was not all that bad.It is well made other than that.I was expecting better tone  that does not mean it do not do the job .. it does and does it pretty good  but I used to have set of those black hella horns and I like that tone more than this one ..  maybe it's just matter of appreciation ..  BTW others are half price of this ones ..
This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.This dog bone seems to be well built, the grips are solid and the cable doesn't seem to get hot even when running the a/c.What can I say, It does what it says. Just make sure to keep it upright. If its on its side or upside down it will leak slightly. Not sure why someone would put it in that position but just a heads up. Cant beat the price on Amazon. Especially if you have prime !
You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered.Basically, this is a voltmeter, similar to a hand-held VOM, and designed to read static voltage and the voltage being pushed to the battery from the alternator as the engine revs ... automobile or motorcycle (having a 12v socket).  The cigarette lighter convenience is what attracted me ... I don't have to juggle a meter and wires with my head under the hood or standing alongside the bike trying to rev it and hold wires and meter, etc.  Tested it already and it seems dead-on with readings at or just a tad under what the hand-held shows.  It's coming on to winter and it's nice, when checking fluids and tire pressure, to do periodic checks on the charging system so you don't get that gut-dropping &#34;click-click-click&#34; when you turn the key in some dark, empty parking lot somewhere you don't want to be!

You don't have to see into the holes just push down and wait for the gurgling to stop.always the correct level.This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.
I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns!I purchased this charger because I termed it 'smart' because of all of the different charging modes it employs.  The deciding factor for this particular model is that it has the constant voltage that you can use when you disconnect the battery to clean the terminals or change the battery.  More important to me than the radio presets are the engine control module settings.  It's nice not having to wait for the computer to relearn the particular variations of settings from the default ones.This is a great product!  It brought back the original look and actually a nice satin-gloss look to my tires.I agree with other reviews, don't care for the Ultra Glossy finish some tire dressing produce and this is a restorer... it helps the rubber.  Just be aware that this is a strong and some what dangerous product, they warn that this can cause  cancer, and as a survivor of Melanoma from last year, I take this cautions seriously!  Just follow the directions, be safe, and enjoy the look this produces!
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech.The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display. Yes, a little air does escape but my unit was always able to make a good seal in a fraction of a second. For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear. I can't think of a practical use for the 'flashlight' feature - it stays on only while the power button is pressed - but there may come a day I will be grateful it was there.I find this gage to perform well and, so far, I was able to operate it without any trouble. I understand that it's possible to perform the exact same readings with a near-free 'analog' gauge but I believe that the added precision and convenience are worth this item's price. However, I will take out one star and rate this gauge as a 4-star mainly for the somewhat misleading '5-year warranty' claim, prominently displayed on the packaging. Given that 'in real life' the customer would pay more for shipping back and forth than it would cost to purchase a brand-new unit the warranty promise, whether 5-year or double-lifetime as quite meaningless.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.for some reason it listed for my application,but it was for a newer vehicle so it did not work for me ,i gave it to my aunty and it worked perfectly.Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
this stuff is amazing, works perfectly, Gas stays very functional all winter, in the boat, Lawn mower, and i use it in the snow blower over the summer.  fantasticoThis product is a must have for anyone driving. Not only does it make it safer for highway driving. Especially when occasionally rain drops are the beyond normal and make it difficult and unsafe to drive.One tip this product works well on highway driving during city however it does work but not as well. During highway driving you can actually see the rain "peel away" from your windshield. WOOOSH!!!live in florida where the sun wrecks everything, especially rubber, plastic and paint, these last for many months and don't chatter
I used the largest rivets for repairs on my car (safety inspections are required here in NH and my '96 Buick failed for rusted rocker panels because they are considered &#34;structural.&#34; I disagree with that assessment, but I guess you can't fight the man on this one. Lived in Michigan my whole life and never heard of anything happening to anyone because of rusted rocker panels, but I digress.) I cut out the rust with a angle grinder and then riveted galvanized steel sheet metal over the hole and sealed it all up using high quality silicone. The handle on the gun usually didn't travel as much as I thought it would before the loud pop. I watched a few youtube videos and someone was pumping the handle 5 or 6 times before the pop. Not sure why the difference, but my rivets seems secure and snug. I actually loved using this and am now looking for more things to rivet. It's a great poor man's alternative to welding.Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price...does exactly what it is suppose to do.(Update) After using this charger less than 5 mos. to maintain my R.V., which is seldom driven, I have found that, because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly, the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead. Now, I'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty.(Update) I have contacted the manufacturer, Schumacher, concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks, have received no response and it doesn't look like I am going to. So, I guess I'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it. BTW, I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers, one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable. Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender.This is absolutely one of the best four and a half bucks I have ever spent. I originally thought I would use it to pour gas into lawn care devices but when it arrived my wife had a need for a funnel to use in the kitchen. She scrubbed it thoroughly and it worked fine for her. In addition, she said it looked like one of the old time hearing aids. Amazingly, she was right on target. By holding the small end to my ear I could clearly hear her, the TV and the telephone. To my utter surprise all sounds are clearly amplified. I never would have believed it if I had not experienced this for myself. There are some frequencies which I have some difficulty in hearing now that I have "matured". My wife's voice is one of them so this is a handy aid when I want to hear something that she does not clearly elucidate. For convenience it even has a loop on the wide end where I can insert a chain or rope to hang around my neck. The uses for this item are nearly endless and I will order another one to serve the original purpoe for which I bought this one which is for pouring gas and oil.This is truly a multi-purpose tool and at a bargain price.
I have a 5th wheel and I check the tire pressure frequently.  When inflating, it gets to be a chore to air up, remove the chuck and check the pressure.  A constant guessing game:  too much, not enough ... you can never tell.  With this gauge, it get it where I want it first try every try.Nice quality piece of equipment.  Buy one!I was apprehensive because of the reviews with people saying theirs only worked once.. But I get the feeling that they didn't understand how the thing works. You can easily damage the components by using it wrong. You pump the thing 3-4 times per quart, but you don't want to sit and pump while you're removing the fluids, that isn't how it works. Pump it a 3-4 times and wait for it to get done, then do it again. It goes pretty fast! I did my brakes, trany, oil, power steering, transfer case, and differential before pulling the plug to get the rest and not make a mess and radiator fluid on a couple different vehicles.. went smoothly. I recommend buying a half inch hose clamp for the rubber reducer.Very simple to install and very effective.I needed a way to ensure my car was forward enough so i could close the garage door, but of course didn't want to hit the wall in the front.  Now I just pull forward until I can feel my tire push up against the AccuPark and I'm done.  I've got more room on the second garage bay, but may get one just so i can pull up as far as I safely can without guessing.
This is my first travel trailer and exposure to an electronic brake control.  The dealer installed an inexpensive reese controller but the slide movement was too sensitive.  I bought this and set it up.  I would recommend to anyone first setting up to have your trailer brakes adjusted, then follow the manual.  After adjustment of the brakes I only needed a boost to 2, down from 3 prior to the adjustment.The reason I chose 4 out of 5 stars is that I am not sure if I have this set up correctly or it is an anomaly.What I mean is that if I start out braking hard I can feel the trailer brakes kick in and get a good stop, but it is not immediate.  If I get off the brakes and coast for 5+ seconds and brake again it can be a bit sensitive and be too much and can jerk the TV around.  if I gradually stop I do not feel the brakes as much.  I do realize that the faster I travel the more boost I need.  My trailer is 146% heavier than the tow vehicle.  It seems that my initial braking sets the sensitivity.  As I slow down for city traffic or campground speeds I only need boost 1.I've got a sport bike that doesn't have any storage.Before, I had a smaller disc lock made by someone else, but the internals on it always locked up - even when I had the key.So, I got this one, wanting something better.This one is too big to mount in the little spot I had before.It came with a little nylon carry bag, and I tried mounting that to the motorcycle, but it didn't stay. I took it off before it fell off and I lost the lock.Now, if I plan to go somewhere that I want to lock up the motorcycle (Wal-Mart or some sketchy bar), I will tuck this into the pocket of my riding jacket if I remember it. The problem is, I have never remember it.I've never gotten any use out of it, yet there it sits: Brand new and never flawed.This is a nicer lock than I expected.  I missed this detail when I ordered it... but this lock is different than the other receiver lock I have used.  Most receiver locks (I think) use spring loaded pins to "lock".  When you unlock it you pull a sleeve out and then the springs push the pins away and the lock comes off.  This is all fine and good till you get some rust, then the springs can't push the pins out and you end up banging on the lock with a hammer for an hour (trust me, I know from experience)This pin has a T-shaped tip and the lock rotates around it to lock it in place.  This means there are no springs to jam.  The turning of the key directly unlocks the pin.  This seems much more robust to me.Notes on Material* The packaging states that the PIN is Stainless Steel.  It never claims the lock is all stainless.  I'm guessing the inside of the lock has some carbon steel due to strength requirements.* Some people have complained that the inside rusts.  I put a couple sprays of silicone in the lock to help protect from rust.Notes on Fit* This is longer than needed for my truck.  I have a 2012 F150 with the Max Tow package.  This is probably about 3/4" longer than what I need.  I was worried about it being too short so I ordered this "extended" version.  I suppose I should have just gone out and measured the hitch receiver.* Anyway, I am not worried.  I will probably add a couple o-rings (like others have said) to keep it from rattling too bad.Pictures* I took some pictures of the packaging and on my truck.  I thought it would be nice to see the notes on the packaging so thats why I took the pics...
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico.Bought this to replace my old Battery Tender Plus. I have a Yuasa lead acid wet cell battery in my bike, this looks to be a good match for it. The included hook up wiring is good quality, and the unit has a simple to read interface: power on, charging, maintenance mode/trickle charge.Glad that we can purchase a good quality charger for so little money...my BT cost $60.One tip: match the charger to the battery type. Lead acid, AGM, gel, lithium ion, lithium iron phosphate batteries all need specific chargers.A few years ago I purchased a cheaper air compressor here, and it is a very heavy little unit and works well. This unit also works well but is very lightweight for what it is. I'm not sure that the construction will hold up over an extended period of use and hauling.If you were just going to put this in the car trunk in case of emergency, then it would probably work fine, and I'm sure that is the target demographic....casual users and individuals who need to inflate balls, air mattresses, etc. For these buyers, the digital display and light is also a perk for easy use and emergency kits.If you regularly use an air compressor or are a bit rough with your "tools," you might want to take a pass and opt for a unit with meatier construction.
Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck.  I like this one.  Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality.I replace my toro mower with this oil which was recommended in the manual and for the  price it is not a bad optionthis is my second review of this product since i bought one for my car and my wifes car. You got to be nuts if you let the dealer charge you $90.00 for a replacement filter that is of lesser quality. it takes 5 min to install. most are installed behind the glovebox.
I try to avoid doing rear brake jobs with drums as best a possible....LOLSo to that end, i have only used this tool a few times.It's effectiveness really depends on the design of the brake job you're doing.  But it's been really good so far for me.Doing rear brakes is like going to battle.  Every fight is going to be different so you have to find the right &#34;Weapon&#34; to do battle with.  Not Like doing caliper brakes.  What do you use???  Sockets and wrenches and DONE!!!!  With rear brakes it feels like you will use anything you can find that will help you win the battle.  LOL!!!!you just have to becareful not to bend the springs when using this tool cause it can happen really easily.It's very handy to have in your arsenal of tools.Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.
Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again,You could achieve the same results but just running a 25' extension cord from the wall to the charger but this is smaller and easier to maneuver so I got this to charge my car and bike.I've used my Mityvac 7201 less than 10 times.  I have treated it very carefully, as I do all my stuff.  But still, it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate.  I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).  I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray, and operating it repeatedly.  But (1) It's still not easy to operate, and (2) I shouldn't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove.  It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement "Tube Connector Kit" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.  I had not noticed this before, but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil!  When I use it in dispense mode now, the main tube doesn't leak anymore, but air and oil come out from under the top plate.  I removed the top plate, and sure enough, "Look Ma, no seal!"  It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed, but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable.  Because I didn't notice this problem sooner, the seal (822821) is costing me an additional $13, including a ridiculous $8.75 fee for shipping.Now I've added (not replaced--added) the top seal, and while doing a test, I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly.  I give up on this thing.This would be a great practical joke if it didn't cost me so much money.
I use it all the time.  I use it to basically flood my engine via the intake/vacuum line.  I let it suck up about 2/3 of the bottle slowly without it killing the engine and then last 1/3rd I just push the vacuum line completely in the bottle and let the engine die essentially.  Then I let it sit anywhere from 30mins to overnight.  Next time you start the car, it will be smoking white smoke (as it burns off all the carbon build up that it helped dissolve) for maybe 5-10mins.  I do this about ever 6mo or so.I love this tire shine, I use it every time I clean the cars. Spray it on, let it set and wipe off the excess. I do not use this as a spray and go or else it will leave a greasy film down the side of the car.I've put this on and axle upside down, it stays where I put it, and so do the bolts, washers, and nutes
This tool requires the use of anti-sieze compound when chasing the threads.  Doing this gets the rust and crud out of the threads.  This is a must for proper seating and sealing of the O2 sensor.Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.
This is part of the 3 step process.  It brings the show room floor shine back to an aging vehicle.  You see the difference with each step.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisibleDecided not to attach it to the counter behind the stove. New camper phobia. Makes a nice work space. Put it on the bed when we travel so it does not rattle.I use this to equalize the grey tanks when camping for 4 days or more. In cold weather we take showers in the camper so the grey tank in the bedroom fills up in 4 days.  This lets us divide the grey water from the kitchen with the one in the bedroom.  It also ads a little capacity because it stores water in the pipes down to the valve.  When dumping just take the cap off of this valve, install hose, close both grey valves, open this valve to drain pipes, drain black tank, open both grey tanks again, rinse and done.
When a car rolls over, nothing is where it should be, except your keys in the ignition.  one snap and you have the tool in your hand to cut the seatbelt if needed, or just press it against the window and BANG, it breaks the glass with a spring loaded steel pin.  Bought this for my mother-in-law becasue she has a fear of being trapped in the car.  she loves it.Strong motor, pumps up quick, only issue i have is it sits in my truck back seat and everytime i get my grandson from daycare he opens the bag and plays with the cord that acts like a slinkie.I have a 2001 Silverado with a 5.3 engine. On the 2001, 5.3 engine the Knock sensors sit in deep pockets. Water tends to get down in there sooner or later and that causes the knock sensors to fail. Replace the harness while you are at, as the harness is the seal.
A snap to install, and easily transferred from one vehicle to another. I couldn't believe all the information that you can get off of the car's computer system.Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.The relay setup is a breeze, if you want to make things easy just connect the aux plug directly to the power plug & horn will work at all times, rather than just when the car is on. You CANNOT take the bolt off on the back, dont try to, the covers can be removed and painted with ease by removing the black screws around the bezel. Also, we cut & drilled a new hole on the bracket to place them where we wanted them & that bracket is made of reinforced Steele & took forever to drill through. Excellent product
not sure what to say - can't make too much of a review on this...the wires provided a proper connection and works. Bought this to replace the one I lost.Used on a 2005 Suzuki SV non-fairing. Hides pretty well, just tuck it away behind the engine mount.Good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room. I use this on my ATV for the batt charger since I put a basket on it. Don't have to crawl under to hook it up.simple, logic and easy to use.  a useful tool to read data from the computer on your car, read codes and diagnose by yourself with a little search on the web. you can take note on the different indicators to know the "normal parameters" of your car, and notice when any change occurs and an error code lights your CEL, that way it will be easier to tell what went wrong.The only con is that there isnt any cable or software to connect to a PC or laptop- that would make it a better tool.
Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be.When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine.A snap to install, and easily transferred from one vehicle to another. I couldn't believe all the information that you can get off of the car's computer system.
No issues, just as described.  Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger.  Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone.This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.
It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!the product is very easy to use all you have to do is follow the directions and that's about it it will do the rest as it sayNot much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.
I got this an an extra after i Damaged the original and as expected it is a perfect fit!.  Good to have a spare sometimes!!!!.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Use this for my kc offroad lights on a mule utv.  Replaced one bad bulb that would come on/off.  Worked as expected.  Nice and bright.Bought this to use with electrical connections on a tail light assembly for a cargo carrier.  It works as described and was a good price.  This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.
Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks.Ordered this so we could do oil change jobs on our 2010 equinox.  Yes it works for the 2.4 as well as the 2.2 that its advertised for.  Does the job as intended.  Don't like the way chevy set up their filters but oh well what can you do.Just used this on one of the most ugliest tests out there  - engine bay oil, dirt, and grime on a 5 year old car.  Sprayed some on and the paper towel lifted everything in one stroke.  Amazing, simply amazing.  Sure beats Simple Green, which doesn't work nearly as well, and leaves a big odor.  This cleaner doesn't do that - just does its job, which is to clean.  I'm sold.
I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.Ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was 3" diameter but it did not fit, it was just sitting on top loosely.  So I'm giving it 3 stars, if it fits your application, I'd imagine it would be rated highly.  So it's back to either a puck or wood for me.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.So after reading the great reviews here I bought this item at Wal-Mart and took it home to charge my deep cycle marine batteries.Worked fine for about an hour, then I noticed that it seemed to be stalled at 85% charge.  I did some more internet reading and discovered that this is a common problem with this unit, the readout stalls at a given percentage and never changes unless you unhook it and rehook it to the battery.  I did that and instantly the readout changed to 100%.So now I know for a fact I can never trust my brand new charger to tell me when it's done charging.And worse, despite being 100% charged the unit never switched over to trickle charge.  So despite being billed as a "smart" charger it's just a normal full power charger that will boil your battery dry if you leave it hooked up too long.  Why spend $45 on something that a $10 charger will do?Not only is it junk, the packaging is a complete lie as well.  Now I know and you can bet your sweet cajones I'll never buy a Schumacher anything again.
I use this Dexron replacement fluid in my 12,000+ pound F-Super Duty utility truck's ZF 5 speed transmission and parking brake unit-Group IV synthetic, and able to take the shock loads of a gear oil!I love this thing so much. I use this to change the oil on my BMW E39. I recently moved to a new apartment complex and was unable to change my oil the traditional way. I purchased the Topsider and got my oil changed in thirty minutes. I don't think I will have to get under the car ever again.Highly recommended!I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville
Amidst the many glowing reviews of this product that appear here (dare I say, some sound more like paid ad copy than 'reviews'), I feel somewhat like a wet blanket and grade A party pooper for saying this: the Emperor isn't wearing any clothes.  This seems to be a decent enough 'household cleaner', along the lines of brand names like 409, Citrasolv and the myriad others competing for your attention on the shelves at the local grocery and hardware stores.  It does a reasonable job removing the accumulated muck in the microwave, does light-duty cleaning in the oven, removes black heel marks from poly-finished wood floors, and so on. However, it does not strike me as offering significant advantages over run of the mill cleaning products. It is up to light to medium duty cleaning - used straight out of the spray bottle and applied directly to the problem area - just like the competitors.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing to write a long letter home about either. Six of one, half dozen of the other.  If there is a Krud Kutter Kult, I'm not joining.Wow, this stuff works well!  We have a wall air conditioner in our home.  It is a quiet variety that we paid a good deal of money for, due to that claim.  It still had a bad resonance of some vibrating metal on the machine.I applied this to all accessible (front face) surfaces, and only the spots where there was not a decal or other item present, probably less than 30% of the total frontal surface (keep in mind 50% is the evaporator and blower vent), and the available space on the front cover.  Wow, we can definitely hear a difference in the room it is installed in.This thing has a strong resonance, so we can still hear it in other spaces.  I feel like it doesnt dampen all modes, but it certainly does enough for a noticeable difference in the space where we have the AC located.This nozzle is exactly as describe in write ups.  It has a variety of water patterns from full soaking to hard steady stream.  You can expect water to come out of the hose a full throttle unless you reduce it manually.  My first attempt to use it was with a small diameter hose and they are not the best to use for a nozzle that uses a standard hose.  The small diameter would not permit pressure buildup inside the hose and therefore the exit of water was at a much smaller volume than a standard hose.  No big thing.  Then I used the standard hose and the nozzle would at best take the stream over the second story of the house with no problems.  While the stream was not a great as I would like it at least got there thusly making this nozzle super for getting at the upper windows.  Next, I placed the nozzle on the front of a hose end sprayer to test its ability to handle liquid weeder, fertilizer or detergent.  It did far better than the nozzle that comes with the hose end sprayer.  Old happy gardener.  When comparing the price of the unit to other available sprayers of similar quality I would have to go with some of the cheaper ones that are made of metal and not plastic.  Some, however, plastic sprayers are not all that bad and one heckuva lot cheaper than the almost $25 for this nozzle.  While it is not perfect, it does the job for what I specifically want to use it for.  Also, I used it on the truck to clean it and it did a decent job except in an effort to preserve water it is something of a pain to have to screw the nozzle each time you want to cut the water off.  In fact, it is doubtful that this nozzle will see vehicle washing again.
Forget the rest. The others are only gimmicks compared to Chevron Techron. Techron absolutely works. It will remove the corn fuel tarnish from your engine and keep those injection needles clean. Yes, I said tarnish. Tarnish will build up in your engine, fuel lines and injectors if you are not using Techron. No, it doesn't matter if you have a 'flex fuel' automobile or not, this tarnish is akin to pancake syrup and will eventually ruin your engine.If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI.HI,This product is a great product that helps you to eliminate rattles/vibrations when you are installing speakers into a vehicle's car doors, rear panels, decks, etc.  It does exactly that and it does it well.There are many claims about it stopping distortion, noise, etc....  However, it should be noted that if you are over powering a speaker..distortion will occur and no padding can stop that.Dynamat has been around for ever and continues to provide a solution that eliminates rattle and vibration.  Use it for that and you will agree that it is a 5 Star Product.  Expect miracles and you will be disappointed.
This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket.On certain fastener applications, where there is vibration and on rubber bushings, this is a must. make sure you are tightening the bolts to ther correct torque specifications.This is a water additive that can potentially increase your cooling capacity by a few degrees by lowering surface tension and increasing boiling point.
For the most part I need to retain my grey water to assist in flushing out the system when dumping the black water.BUT for those times where I need to let some grey water out discreetly I can. The hose connection allows me to run it away from the TT and into the woods.Recently swapped out my old cabin air filter for this new Wix cabin air filter. When I slid out the old cabin air filter it was covered in dust and leaves from the fall (disgusting). Seriously people change these things out at the start of every winter, you'll be glad you did. The new filter slide right in the factory housing and fit perfectly. Snapped it back in place and bam, done in five minutes. Watch YouTube for videos on how to do this it saves you at least $60 that the dealer would tack on for labor and markup on the filter.If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.Right out of the package I used it first on the front tire of my bike and the gauge and pressure release worked fine and then I used it on the back tire and the pressure gauge read zero.  The release malfunctioned after the first use, so the dial would go back to zero right after you pulled the gauge off the tire.  I put it back in the box and returned to Amazon.com immediately!  I do NOT recommend!
I use this on my r1 during the cold days in winter or when ever i put the bike in to storage. Still working till now and this includes a spare wire to place a dis-connectable connector from your battery to the battery tender (which can be routed from your battery to your backseat compartment) Highly recommended.Great to be able to buy a six pack of oil from Amazon.  This is great oil and I use it in a European car that requires this from the factory specs.This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.
I used the OE cabin filter from when i bought my car brand new. It was an excellent filter, no complaints.However when looking for a replacement filter i noticed Fram fresh breeze. I was in love with the concept of baking soda and carbon lining in the filter medium. I couldn't be happier with the result. I get clean smelling air outside, even during traffic hour, and as far as i can tell it traps just as much dirt as the OEM filter media.considerations:The filter is significantly heavier than the OE filter which is to be expected from the carbon and the baking soda, and because of its rigidness, take care not to bend or force the filter inside the slot because there is a risk of breakage. your filter can burst at the seams, letting out its contents if not handled with care.I'm am not sure how long the fresh air effect will last because the capacity of the filter wont allow large amount of carbon and baking sodawith those considerations, I think its the best investment i made changing to fram fresh breeze.Car:2006 scion tcOwnership: about 1 month and still smells goodI can not beleive how GREAT this tool is. It makes oil changes a JOY, clean and easy. I have been changing oil in my cars for 35 years. I have lots of memories of laying on my back with oil running down my arm, or spilling oil out a pan or dropping the drain plug into a pan full of oil..... NO LONGER..... I am sure I am getting 99% of the oil out by going down dip stick hole.Once all the oil is out it is in spill proof contaner and easy to bring to the local tire/oil change/auto part place to recycle. I really love this tool.On my 2010 VW JSW (Jetta Sportwagen) TDI (Turbo Direct Injection Diesel) the Dealer wants $85 after all the tax and Haz Mat disposal. Although the recommend oil change interval are every 10K; I do it at about 6,500-7,500. Oil and filter are about $50. Money I save I can change oil more often.VW has a belly pan that requires 19 screws be removed.... to access the drain. It takes me 30 min from start to finish to change oil and filter with the Hydro-Turf Oil Extractor. It would be double that going from the bottom and a lot more messy.VW recommends you change the drain plug and crush washer everytime.... another $4 every oil change. The oil filter is on top of the engine in a canister so there is no need to get under the car. Also the oil filter is vertical and sits on top; the base of the oil filter housing has some deep pockets in the base. I used the hydro-turf oil extractor is great at getting every drop of oil out of the oil filter housing, a significant amount, at least 3 to 5 ounces of oil......  Again what little old oil remains is insignificant and with the ability to drain the oil filter housing, not possible with out an extractor, it is as good as drain from the bottom at the pan method in my opinion. Highly recommend.The Key Vault appears to be well made, with very little plastic.  Being concerned about rust (which may or may not be a problem), I put a little bit of Teflon oil on the inside of the two sliding retainers that hold the two pins in, as well as a drop on the two latch points before installing.  This way, if it does get some rust, it will have less of a chance of seizing up.  Long term instead of oil, I'd probably recommend a small amount of Teflon based grease where the pin contacts the two sliders, as well as on where the sliders contact the inner wall.  Since the drawer walls are high, the oil isn't going to come into contact with the contents.  I'd probably consider a drop of oil on the spring in the back that pushes the drawer out when the right combination is entered and the lever pulled.I easily changed the combination and had no problems whatsoever installing it.  Time will tell if it gets water into the drawer, but so far, it looks decently water resistant.  I personally am not worried about water getting in the drawer.As for people being able to tell it is there, the only real way someone can find it is if they examine the hitch pins and notice that it isn't a standard hitch lock, or pull off the dust cover.If someone had to place a spare key on a vehicle, this is the most secure solution for this answer.  Of course, a thief who has some power tools can get into it, as well as someone sitting there flipping through 10,000 combinations.If someone is worried that keeping a spare key in this would be a security issue, you can do the following which an acquaintance of mine does:  Keep a "dummy" key in the Hitch Safe that will open the door.  Then inside the vehicle, use a console or other strongbox with a stout lock store in there a spare key that works in the ignition.  This way, for a thief to steal the vehicle, they would have to either break out the Hitch Safe, then try drilling out a heavy steel enclosure for the ignition key, or break the windows and try to get into the console safe.  Either way, eventually a thief would prevail, but it will take a lot of time and noise.  For all but the most crime-plagued areas, the Hitch Safe appears good enough -- it keeps all but the dedicated thieves with hand/power tools away.
Not the best. I put this in the back of my pickup, covered by a topper, to run a 12v cooler during the summer. I put groceries in the cooler from store to home.Instal is straight forward. The black wire grounds directly to the box with a sheet metal screw. I ran a hot from the battery + via 10ga to the red and spliced them together.The unit is one piece, plastic. I used body tape to stick this to the pickup box and drilled holes for two sheet metal screws. So far, it holds well and works. I get the feeling this will not last as long as I want as it seems a little cheaply made. Then again, it was cheap so I am not expecting great things from it.This is a nifty little device that attaches to your vehicle's OBDII port under the dash. It is adaptable to most vehicles (visit Scangauge's website to be sure yours is on the list). Interestingly, it interfaces via an ethernet port. I used it on a Ford Taurus, A Mercury Grand Marquis, and a Dodge Caravan. Yes, it displays real time MPG data. It also gives you the average time weighted average MPG. RPM, MPH,and TPS data- no problem. Coolant temperature, Ditto. Manifold absolute pressure depends on the vehicle. Same with intake air temperature. It does not give the actual O2 sensor reading, only if the loop is closed or open. It will definitely teach you skills to improve your fuel economy. Surprisingly, the larger your engine the better you will do because you can take advantage of low rpm high torque situations. I got 29.1 MPG with my Grand Mark using it (Averaged over 65 miles in city, highway and country backroads passing Amish Buggies) Philadelphia to Lancaster, PA. I would have given it 5 stars but the materials it is made with are lightweight and I'm not sure if it will stand the test of time. It is a very useful gadget, and it is a shame we can't hook it up to a laptop to send the data to the state DOT to pass emissions inspection. I suggest ScanGauge look into this, it would probably only take a software upgrade, I know the hardware is up to task. I also suggest they encase it in shockproof rubber to protect it.This is a follow up review  5000 miles out from the last review. I revised the unit to 5 stars. Its durability has proven the test of time and jockeying between 3 vehicles. It sits nicely above the wheel of my V8 Grand Marquis with no significant dash obstruction. It maves easily from vehicle to vehicle an is capable of taking a hit bere or there. It would still be nice to have a shockproof rubber case but I upped my rating to 5 stars both because it held up well and it helped me average between 24-28 MPG country in my Grand Mark. It paid for itself in gasoline already. Anything more is gravy now. The only thing I suggest is a list of OBD codes to go with the unit. It is no longer as easy to find them using google because the mechanics and auto makers want to keep this information proprietary. Google OBD and the first 50 entries are either discussion boards, parts suppliers, or sensor makers. The same happens when you seek out a specific code. You have to dig but you can find what they mean. A list would be nice.This appears to be a very nice kit! I gave it 4 starts because I have not used it yet and would have been nice if the manufacturer included a tube of rubber cement to aide in and sealing any tire plugs. Also I see velcro material on the exterior of the kit case, but no velcro was included in the kit to apply to the interior of the vehicle or storage area.What I do like about this kit is that there is an adapter to run the compressor off the battery directly as some of these new car 12V sources can not handle the amperage load.I will report back after it`s first use, whenever that may be... otherwise it looks like a very good kit.
They are as described. I removed the double sided tape because I wanted to use a flexible silicone along with the screws to permanently mount these to my travel trailer. Now I no longer need to get out my 4ft level when I arrive at the camp site.I bought this wrench to remove the oil filters on my arctic cat quads.  I can never get them off and have resorted to punching holes in them with a screwdriver and then turning the screwdriver to remove the filter.  This wrench worked like a charm and I no longer have to tear  up the oil filter to remove it.I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.
Water Wetter is designed to be used in a system of solely distilled water. Water Wetter is then added to the mix to help the water have better contact with the metal.  Redline's claim is that with just water air will accumulate due to the heat on the metal's surface and this does not allow maximum heat transfer to the water. The Water Wetter will stop that air from forming thus allowing for more cooling potential. According to their results, up to 20 degrees.Now this can also be used in systems with a mixture of water and antifreeze but the results will be severly diminished, down to just a couple of degrees. On top of that beware of the "black sludge" that can accumulate with Water Wetter combining with certain types of Antifreeze. I would recommened using google to find results on this.Redline does recommened draining and refilling the system of Water Wetter and water once a year. This in my opinion is due to the fact that this is designed to be used in race cars and not so much street vehicles, yes even high performance street vehichles. If you are doing research you will find one over riding response "if you have a cooling system problem this will not fix it."I purchased this before I did enough research. I have decided not to use the product and take a loss on the investment. My car is a street car and I was going to flush my system and use only distilled water, since I live in an area that doesn't have to worry about freezing. After doing my research I will go with just a higher percentage of distilled water to antifreeze. This will help keep my maintenance time to a minimum and also increase my cooling efficiency.Although I bought expensive potable water hoses for my motorhome and gave them a good rinsing before connecting them, I still detected that distinctive "hose taste" in my RV's water.  Installing this filter between the hose and my RV eliminated that taste.  It also filters out odd odors and tastes that I encounter with some campground water.  When there are high chlorine levels in the water, this filter won't get rid of all of it but it does knock it down.  Be sure to rinse the filter for about one minute before connecting it to your RV for the first time or you'll get black carbon powder in your water.  The included flexible hose protector works perfectly; enabling me to connect the filter directly to my RV water inlet without the need for any other fittings, allowing me to close and lock the access door.After using one of these filters for about a year, I would not consider ever connecting my motorhome to any water supply without having this filter on-line.Although all the marinas where I fill my boat with gas are ethanol free, I on occasion have to fill up on my way to or from the lake.  Sta-Bil marine fuel stabilizer is an ethanol treatment to prevent ethanol gas from messing with your boat motor's innards.  I am have faith in sta-bil products (fuel stabilizers) and time will tell how this product holds up over time.
This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.DixitYou can't go wrong with these and should place them on all vehicle battery terminals after cleaning them. They are very easy to apply; red on positive, green on negative, between the battery and the terminal, on the post. Do this quickly as the car computer may require reprogramming if you do it too slow; if that happens it is easy to reprogram, just read your owners manual (it can alter window and door lock function). Before you start blow across the vents to dissipate and vapors that could explode with sparking, wear protective glasses and protective clothes (long sleeves) and wash your hands after.  The liquid in the cells is very acidic and will eat through clothes and skin. This is a good time to add distilled water to the vent holes. Do not top them off but bring the level to the bottom of the venting ring; leave space to vent the gases, there is a slot. Close the cell caps. Use a wire brush on dirty or corroded or fuzzy (usually a white or green powder) terminals and connectors.  Check your electrolyte, if you know how, to see if your battery is weak or has low/bad cells. If you have a lot of corrosion, cap the vents and mix about a tsp. of baking soda in a glass of water and brush it on with a toothbrush (if you get any in a cell it will kill the battery), it will foam up if there is acid, then rinse and dry before placing the washers and terminals. Remove the ground first, place the felt washer, replace the terminal, then place the positive. Reset your clock and anything with memory (GPS). Prepare for winter. If your battery is past the expiration date, replace it so you don't get stuck somewhere. Most good batteries do not live past their expiration date and can't be relied upon. Walmart and Costco batteries seem to be the most reliable according to reviews.This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used. It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available. Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this. Check on forums for you car if you're unsure.
I got this an an extra after i Damaged the original and as expected it is a perfect fit!.  Good to have a spare sometimes!!!!.Fits perfectly, will not slip and 3/4 the price in an RV accessory store (same Thing).  Cleans off in a JiffyIn order to replace the oxygen sensor, I needed a way to tighten in the new unit. While this could also be used to remove the old one, the slot in the side weakens the structure which could result in breakage. To avoid that risk, just cut the top half off the old one and back it out with an air wrench and impact socket. Then this socket installs the new one without damage.
I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections.Used this RTV to create a gasket on an F150 differential cover. Used about 1/3 to 1/2 tube on the diff cover to ensure adequate coverage.  Applied around the bolt holes.  Begins to get tacky in about 5 minutes. Installed diff cover and finger tightened bolts, let set for approx. 1 hour.  Then tightened bolts to OEM specs.  Filled with gear oil and no leaks.Does the job for which it was intended. Added to HOT water and dissolved, pour it into the base of the Air-O-Swiss humidifier to clean any 'scaling' and other 'old water' contaminants. Then thoroughly rinse (without dunking the base under water) and do this about every 2 months.
It does what it is supposed to and suds up.I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.
I used this stuff on a boat I put aside for 2+ yrs and the fuel is still burning as if new.  I HATED to leave the fuel in the tank that long but it could not be helped and the Stabil did its stuff.  I would add it to any combustion engine not run regularly and even those that are with carbs especially.  Try not to use ethanol laced fuel in low use applications and always splash this stuff in your tank.  Your life will improve and others will admire you.Will work great for what I bought it for.Haven't used it yet and will post if it turns out to be a pos.I can tell this probably won't last long, but as long as you're not expecting something that will last you a few years this will do the trick. I used this to change my power steering fluid and it worked well. The siphon end is pretty big though, so if you're expecting to drain anything with a small fill hole you might be out of luck.
Five stars for novelty.Five stars for convenience.One star for being a necessity.I really like this product. It is very neat to pop what appears to be a large white tablet out of a bubble pack and add water, then watch it grow into a thick  wet paper towel. You can use it to clean up spills by putting the tablet on the spill and using it to absorb the liquid as it turns into a paper towel. This product has the consistency more of a very thick paper towel than a cloth. It is paper and reminds me of the old paper towels called Job Squad of the late eighties and early nineties that were monster thick and could handle any paper towel job or spill. The first time I used one I thought "Wow this product is neat, it is like something from Star Trek or the Jetsons". It is literally a tablet that turns into a small "cloth", you simply add liquid and unfold it. If you have a real need for keeping a small conveniently dry paper towel stored some where to use later this is an excellent product. The problem is, I can not think of any real situations where you can not just keep a roll of paper towels or a cloth. This product might be useful for hunters, fisherman, or boaters because they can be put in a pocket to use later as needed. They would also be great to use by outdoors men if it is raining and impractical to have paper towels. It may just be I have a lack of imagination for its uses since I am a home body. The product is great if you really need it. But in most situations a roll of paper towels will do the trick.I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.Water Wetter is designed to be used in a system of solely distilled water.

Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThese will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.

Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out. It's title is true. I do not know why some give five stars to this product is very difficult to use it. might not have used it and lie so bad that confuse buyers because they believe that having five stars is a good product but it is not true .. I recommend the pva Chomu. I have one for seven years and works extremely well.How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...I agree with the other reviewers who state the unit is ugly.  the welds are bulky and uneven.  However, the welds seem stout and I am sure it will perform just fine.  After all, this is about as low-tech as you can get.  I will disagree with other reviewers who say the unit does not move/sway.  I have a 5/8&#34; pin in it and my bike rack moves pretty substantially.  I will be getting an adapter to remedy this problem.  Bottom line for me for this product was price.  I am overall pleased with Curt and this product.
This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far.Probably a good filter but didn't fit the application. Amazon made it right, but be sure this fits your car before buying.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!  The AC power supply works as advertised but the inverter cooling fan is rather noisy.  You can hear it from one room of the house to the other.  The LED light is smart as LEDs use very little energy.  There are consistent complaints about the air compressor taking forever to inflate a tire.  The problem is not in the air compressor but the little black nipple at the end of the house.  One must, with the lever first up, push the inflation fitting all the way onto the tire valve stem by twisting the fitting and gently pushing until  you can see none of the brass fittings and then push down the lever to connect the hose and open the valve on the valve stem.  If you do this correctly, you will see the actual tire pressure currently in the tire on the air pressure gauge.  If the air hose fitting is not on the valve stem properly, when you turn on the inflator, the air pressure will initially say 0 psi until you turn on the pump and then the pressure will jump up to 100psi.  What is happening in this situation, is that the air compressor is trying to push against a closed valve.  It will VERY SLOWLY push air into the tire.  Make sure you have the fitting right and it will work very quickly.  Black and Decker should put a better air hose fitting on the end of the hose to eliminate this issue.As stated, everything works.  Ultimately, I will use the dc receptacles to charge the device via solar panels through a charge controller.Update as of 9/19/2009I have had this unit for some time now and have been charging it via the 12 volt cigarette lighter with a small 30 watt array using two Sunforce 15watt panels in parallel.  I use a Sunforce 7 amp charge controller to protect the battery in the device. I can easily charge this unit in about 6 hours from a depleted point at which the inverter auto shut off to protect the battery the night before.  I get 5 to 6 hours of light from a standard torche lamp in my living room with a 23 watt cfl installed.  I recently started charging it in parallel with a old jump starter pack I had been given as an anniversary gift at a job. If I am only using 6 hours of the sun, I am not storing all the energy I can.I now run the Electromate in the living room for about 5 hours to power the lamp and the Jump start pack gets a 75 watt inverter plugged into it and I run an identical setup upstairs in my computer room.I want backup power in an emergency and a very good way to get the bugs out is to use it continually so the problems will pop up at I time when I don't really need emergency power, instead of at the most inopportune time.When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
Needed for the 2010 Toyota Sienna.  I tried some others and they don't allow you to take off the canister.  This is necessary if you want to change your own oil.I purchased 1 of these to tow my 16 ft camper from Northern New England to Florida this past Spring. You can buy 2 of them and use them for extra protection. I didn't need to do more than 1 as my camper is about 1600 lbs...It took me some driving and stopping to ask others why I didn't feel my sway bar was working to understand I was using it wrong.I had the sway bar to tight. The handle is very easy to turn and you can feel when it gets taunt. Over tightening it will defeat the purpose of using this item. It is NOT a stabilizer bar..it's a sway bar.. took me a while to get it...I prefer to have the sway bar for my small camper..plus it's easy to remove or even loosen..which you really have to do to turn around in tight spaces. The thing will screech as you turn! The sway bar is sup to allow your camper to do some sway just not very much sway. if you over tighten it, it will not work properly..when the wind hits you, both the camper and the car will feel the pull back and forth.. you don't want that.. you want the camper to be able to have some sway with the wind. This product is great because you can adjust the amount of tension for low winds/high winds. GREAT PRODUCT!I don't have much to say about it. Its a filter. Don't notice any extra &#34;freshness&#34; to the air. I had an old filter and it didn't smell, so this one doesn't add any extra benefit to me. I'll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time. Definitely change these yourself. DO NOT let your oil change guys do it for you. Look up your car on Youtube and type is cabin filter replacement. I'm sure you'll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself. I'm guessing you'll save $30+

I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.No mileage improvement on new car.I bought this for PM and really didn't expect and increase in mileage. Based on all the reviews I believe this will keep my new car running like new for a long time.My car has two MPG meters built in. I started using this additive after break-in at 6,000 miles. I drive the same route to work everyday. I did not have any measurable change in mileage... Not surprised since the car is new.The engine is definitly quieter in the morning when 1st started (cold start). (I start the motor in the garage with my window open, so all the engine sounds are amplified)I will continue to use this additive to prevent fuel system problems and offset the negative effects of methanol...Usage: Label instructions are "2-3oz per 10gals". Having a new car I use 2oz per 10gal, or 1oz per 5gal every time I buy gas. I took one of my wife's 1/4 cup measuring cups which is 2oz. I add the treatment when I get home. Keeps it simple.Amazon's price changes between 20 and 26. Get the best price by putting it in your cart and save it for later. When the price changes, Amazon shows you the price changes since the last time you checked your cart.Thanks for all the reviews.I have had no problems with the functional use of this connector.  I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.  If you can't find Safari Charlie, I'd recommend trying an electrical contact cleaner or conductive contact grease like what is used on trailer harness connectors.  Any auto parts store should have those.
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.If your working with spark plugs you need this. As standard as they come and guaranteed to work.  Helped me gap my plugs with no problems. If you don't know how to use, just youtube it.i have the 2004 lex rx330 and right in it goes.  if you need directions, go to youtube to see the fine fellow demonstrating it.  you cant go wrong son.
Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS

Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi DevilleWhen I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in.
Amazon's website says the 15" version of this wiper will fit on a 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  That is not really true.  This wiper was "backwards" what my Cayenne required and I had to spend 15 minutes reversing the rubber to get it to fit the Cayenne.If you have a Porsche Cayenne, try something else.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer.

I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.
I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.I don't know what the water is like in all the campgrounds we go to, and don't want to have to check the water! Having this attached to the water supply is just plain common sense!Hi, I got this after reading that it had great reviews, I was not disappointed. Usually I like to check my car's tire pressure usingAccutire MS-4350B Setpoint Tire Gaugewhen I fill the gas tank, so I thought I needed a device to check the tire's tread depth every once in a while just to be safe and to know exactly when to rotate the tires or replace them. I like this digital gauge, it's made of plastic, it comes with a soft protective sleeve and it includes a spare battery! what else can you ask for? Highly recommended.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.This product restored my black trim on my bumper, fender and side door panels! The only draw back is the bottle is small and if you have a large truck you may want to invest in another bottle.If you want this in chrome type the letter C infront of it in your search.  I love the welded nut option it is a life saver for motorcycles or small engine bays.
Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).I bought these for my 2003 Tahoe,hard to believe but both front windows failed on the same day.check out the video on Youtube for your model car.buy a can of silicone & spray all your window channels,door locks & hindges when you are doing the job.
Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RVNo headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile.
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.This charger is just what is needed for those times when your battery is low or dead and you need to get back in the action.Small but large on help for your AUtomotive Battery.  Can be used on any type of Automotive Battery.  Even charges and normalizes Deep cycle batteries and won't over charge either.  A real  little DynamoThis is a great product!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have purchased similar items in the past that did not  perform nearly as well and were not as accurate reading and stable!!You just plug it in to any of your vehicles auxilary power outlets and it lets you know the battery condition with the engine off.  Start the engine and it  lets you know how you alternator is doing by the charging voltage.  It  also has 3 light emitting diodes red, yellow, and green.  Red  (for very low battery or bad battery cell or poor alternator output)  Yellow (for marginal battery charge or low alternator output)and green (for full battery charge and proper alternator output)'It will also give a red if the alternator output voltage is too high or when a battery charger is connected to the battery. It is much more accurate than your gauge on your car unless you have a digital voltmeter in your instrument panel. I use it on all of my vehicles, especially the ones with idiot lights or connect it with an auxilary socked with  alligator clips to the battery of vehicles with no  charge indicator.  It diagnoses problems  relatively quick and  lets you see a problem before you battery goes dead.
I replaced my Sylvania bulbs with these for Low Beams and these are just great!Good vision, white light, great coverage and none of that 'dingy' blue hue...I also bought/used the PIAA 9005 Intense White High Beam bulbs.....to those who wish to know the truth regarding PIAA light bulbs.the PIAA light bulbs are no better than stock light bulbs.i purchased my 2004 toyota corolla brand new. the stock lights burned out in the year 2011.do the math, seven years without a stock light burn out.stock lights are just as good or better than the overpriced PIAA light bulbs.PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin PackThese lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights.
After the rain I'd usually have dirt on the sides and on the back.  After doing all 3 steps and going through a day of rain, those pesky black rain drops weren't on the back or splash marks on the side.  the dirt didn't stick.They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.We bought and installed extras of these on our RV, just because the manufacturer never seems to put them in convenient places.  I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them.
Bought for an APO address and free shipping, couldn't beat it. When you twist off the bottle cap the remaining ring easily falls off, so be careful if you pour directly into your oil reservoir, don't want the plastic ring falling in with the oil. But use a funnel and you won't have the problem. Will buy again.I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket.If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these coversEvidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.
Do what the ir suppossed to do.  I like these so much better than the MOPAR ones that wrap arounf the roll bar.  These actually use existing hardware on the sound bar or on the windsheild.  You can also place them behing the headrest.  I have the MOPAR velcro ones and these look so much better.Works excellent! Get the Aerosol over the liquid if you have the pod style filter or flat corrugated style for sure. It spays nice and even. I have used them both, the spray, and the liquid and the spray is the way to go for these. If you do have the older all foam style filters then get the liquid (squirt/pour kit or bottle) it will last you longer.These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.
i like how short this terminal connector is, much shorter then other 7-way plugs i have seen.  the light are great to verify that you are getting power through the plug.I haven't used the set point part of it, but just the fact you can put it on the valve stem and audibly hear when it's done taking the reading makes it far superior to all my other ones. With other ones I'm bending down, trying to see if it's taken the reading or not. I mean, isn't kneeling down far enough? Do I really need to put my head towards the ground further? With other gauges, I do. Not with this one though. Big backlit display that automatically comes on and automatically goes back off. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this.if you hook them up right, they work amazing. having so many settings allows me to have options for the mood i am in. the sound setting doesnt work so well unless the music is really blasting tho. other than that, they are great.
Just received my 2nd unit (for emergency backup).  First off, the first one I have is similar to the other photo that a customer posted here, that contain the "white grip guards".  The NEWER models do not have the white covers because the teeth of the grips are recessed (per customer service technical support), and can't make contact with metal or anything to short them out.  I purchased my first unit this summer, and now the new models are out with the upgraded recessed grips. Personally, I still like the one with the grip covers, mainly because I know for a fact they are covered. I'll probably place some small kiddie size cups on them to reduce my paranoia :)I have one I leave in my diesel truck, and the 2nd one I keep in my RV for using as backup power via 12 volt socket.  I haven't used any of these units yet to jumpstart my vehicle or anyone else's but I like how easy it is to charge this units, and the fact your can easily use it to power 110 volt equipment using an inverter.  Very versatile, and a good display reading on the front showing the voltage is a plus.  Nice compact unit, and doesn't weigh a lot.Wouldn't be without them!I use this cable with my solar kit and am very happy with the durable construction. I use a small solar panel to charge up my deep cell battery, and then attach these clamps to the positive and negative posts. Voila; an instant DC power socket.I also use these clamps on my car battery when I want to get the most watt power for electronic devices. When paired with a small USB inverter, I can get the full 140 watts from it, instead of the 100 watts available through my cigarette lighter.The cables are of middle thickness, but are smooth and well constructed. The clamps are secure when attached to battery posts, and easy to remove. The length is a bit on the spare side, but I understand that these cables cannot be too long and still provide useful electrical  juice. I'm pleased with this purchase, and plan to order a second one to live inside my car.A good handy item to have. I have used it on my motorcycle, lawn motor, 2 scooters and have tender leads on all of these items plus my farm tractor. I also brought a couple of tender leads with the battery clamps, one in my motorcycle and the other is with my farm tractor in case I have a dead battery all I have to do is hook those leads to jumper cable and battery tender leads, am ready to start whatever the jumper cables are hook up to. Make sure that the jumper cable negative and positive are not touching each other
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYIInstalled these with the KC windsheild mounts on my 90 YJ. The harness and instructions were really easy to follow .Installed in less than 2 hours with everything tied down and hidden. My wife and I were out in the jeep looking at Christmas lights and I was on a dark road and flipped them on. WOW! These 130W daylighters definetely light up the road. They were so bright my wife asked if they were legal.Several things, you have two grounds, make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface, I used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment.If you have a narrow mounting location, you may want to consider the slim lights, these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight.The only negative thing I can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the 80's. I painted mine black and placed a vinyl KC sticker on them. Looks much better, but still ordered the KC rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them. (5 stars if they would have come with a rock guard cover, instead of the solid yellow smiley faces.)Purchased these for emergency use with our 2009 FIT.  I have not used them yet, but made sure they fit the wheels and did not hit anywhere in the wheel wells.  They were fine on both counts.  Also seem to be of high quality, given the price.  The only comment I might suggest to the next purchaser is regarding rubber tighteners which Amazon lists as an item frequently purchased together.  The chain manufacturer's instructions state that you should not use rubber tighteners with these cable chains as it might pull them off center and then cause damage to tires/vehicle from the chains.
This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.Bought this to use with electrical connections on a tail light assembly for a cargo carrier.  It works as described and was a good price.  This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.
Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern.They are as described. I removed the double sided tape because I wanted to use a flexible silicone along with the screws to permanently mount these to my travel trailer. Now I no longer need to get out my 4ft level when I arrive at the camp site.
these are original manufacturer type wires,  good materials used to make, but quality in testing before shipping is a problem.  when you receive them check the resistance value to make sure they are all  700 ohms or less.These K&N; Filters are not made in the USA to my surprise.  They are made in Thailand.I probably won't buy K&N;'s anymore.  For 1/2 the price, I can get WIX filters made in the US.My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.
This is a factory ScanGauge Cable. I bought it to more easily transfer my ScanGauge from different vehicles so I wouldn't have to take down my already routed cable in my primary vehicle. Great value. Cheapest price I could find online unless you want to make your own cable.Got these and some jacks for my trailer. Instructions say to level up the trailer using a level and then apply these. It's great to have these in place  if you have jacks installed on your trailer or motor home.My bike came with a Yuasa battery and I"ve heard good things about Yuasa.  So why not buy a charger from the same company that makes your batter??Its nice to have the two types of batter connectors.  I mount the hard-wire kit to my motorcycle and whenever it will sit for a while, i can charge the battery without needing to take off the seat, etc to get to the batter.  Then you also have the alligator clips to use when you need to charge other batteries like lawn equipment.
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires.
Do what as it says and you'll get the results you wanted. don't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint. otherwise, this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxingJust a smidge of this product will turn a once tarnished nasty piece of aluminum into a beautiful shine that you wouldn't believe. Really you can see your reflection in the surface after polishing it up. Will always purchase Mothers Mag and Al polishIf you own a Hi-Lift, I may suggest to have this repair kit. You don't know when you will have to use it.
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.Fit the application perfectly, and the car started without hesitation on the first crank.  I would recommend however that you look into the Optima website directly to purchase batteries, as they have an offer that extends their standard warranty when you purchase one of their chargers as part of the battery purchase.  You can't get the warranty if you do not purchase them together.  I'm not sure, but it does make sense that if you purchase this battery or any others in their line and you do purchase a charger in the same transaction they would probably honor the warranty extension, but I would check with them first.  The bottom line however, is that these batteries are so well made that they will probably outlast a standard battery 5 times over, so what's the logical point to extend the warranty to two years to begin with.  They're just trying to sell chargers and giving you the incentive by upping the warranty.  I'm certain the battery will far outlast that 2 year warranty.  As with all batteries, you should invest in a good smart battery charger rather than something cheap from Harbor Freight.For my GAS engines I either purchase Bosch Premium (Black) or Purolator PLs (Yellow).  I've read that they are the same filter now.  Don't know.  What I do know is that they are both quality filters for less than $6 from Amazon.  I change them when indicated either by the manual or the driver info readout on the dash.  Never a problem.The Purolators do have the nice little texture grip, but hardly a deal breaker / maker.  These things fit and if you do a web search on filter testing, they are both consistently at the top of the ranks.
Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push downThey are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.
they are light and smaller than you would expect, but they work fine and store easy as they fit into one another (stackable)Wanted covers for the trailer tires to extend their life due to sun damage. These were inexpensive but they fit fine and the adjustable straps hold them securely.I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous.
These are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.These are fairly solid lead cables. The cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair, where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead, each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap USB cable.The banana clips are normal/common, the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part, i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard, these are solid. Additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable, i think it will hold up very well and not break lose.The alligator clip ends seem to be just fine. contrary to others results i have 2 pairs and the alligator ends are just fine, teeth all line up fine. the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close. clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersOverall:Really wish they were combined leads not 2 separate wires and thicker gaugeGood cables, and i would still recommend them** If this review helped you please click the button below **These blades are very quiet with no chatter. I mean it is almost eerie when you see them move and realize that noise is missing. They also pickup all the little tiny drops like the Bosch micro edge blades do. I will be buying these again!
These are the same as you could get at the local auto parts, but if you go there, you will stand in line waiting for a low paid & disgruntled associate and when they serve you (after they put their cell phone down), they will more than likely give you the wrong part and overcharge you for it. Overall, these wires are great and the di-electric grease provided is enough to get the job done.These lights are just what they say and if you want good off road driving lights you know you need to spend the bucks.  Wiring was complete and simple, lights worked just like they were suppose too.  I don't plan to be driving off road at night but these are on there just in case.  Like they say you only have to need them once and they paid for themselves.just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you did
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderthey are light and smaller than you would expect, but they work fine and store easy as they fit into one another (stackable)
This scraper deserves its five star reviews because it effectively removes thin ice without any danger of scratching your glass. Let me address some of the negative comments in other reviews:1. Yes, the handle is a bit thin and flimsy, but it is sturdy enough for removing thin ice without worrying about it breaking.2. Yes, the brass blade does attract ice shavings and they do pile up on the scraper, but this does not interfere with removing the ice or make the scraper difficult to use.3. Yes, the blade is only 3", but because this scraper works more efficiently than a larger plastic scraper blade, you will not spend any longer removing the ice.While this scraper works well for thin ice on your windshield and windows, for thicker ice you do need a heavier duty scraper. This scraper simply cannot effectively "bite into" thicker ice.IMPORTANT: Some sellers charge a full shipping charge for each scraper you order no matter how many you order at one time. To avoid this, based on another review I ordered my 4 scrapers through Firehawk Technology, which had an additional shipping charge for each extra scraper of only fifteen cents.Bottom line: This product works very well. Make sure you don't get ripped of with excessive shipping charges.Be aware this is a regular cutting board, cut perfectly to size, has a drip guard, with a full sized piece of waffle-type, beige, non-slip rubber material on the bottom, and comes with a free thin plastic cutting mat that you can really use for cutting on. Our new wood board needed some light sanding and oil, and, it is so nice looking it will probably be only used for counter space, not for cutting on. It can be cut on but the free mat will be fine. It fits perfectly and has some weight to it and it does not move during travel on curvey or bumpy roads. Great price, fast ship, protected well, and it is a great counter space increaser, and silencer of the metal stove-top cover 'rattle', which we notice in a motor-home. You do not really need a folding metal stove top cover, and most RV's are short on kitchen counter space. This is the perfect solution with a bonus. I think they include the plastic cutting mat knowing the board will not be used. Get this if you have an RV with this sized stove-top. I do not know anything about the Silent Stove Top Cutting board, except the photos show no drip guard. This is less expensive and I cannot imagine anything working, or looking, better than this. Highly recommend! You do not install this. Simply remove the metal cover (quick and simple) and set this on the burner grate, and that's it. My sanding and oil is just what one should do to a nice piece of wood.  Use mineral oil, or cutting board oil, on both sides and all edges and do not let the board dry-out or be subjected to very high or low temperatures. I added more counter space at the end of a counter by ordering two  8"x8" brown hinges and a very nice looking 3/4" teak cutting-board from Amazon. Fast 2-day ship and free return with Amazon Prime.CONS: This bag is very snug and somewhat difficult to fit my helmet into. But I will also mention that I wear a XL ICON Domain II helmet that has a little spoiler kind of hanging off the top of the helmet. Does not have enough room to store an extra shield.PROS: Made very well and offers a good degree of protection without being too bulky. The price was very good.SUMMARY: Would I buy this bag again? Yes. I like a bag that does not take up a lot of space, has a snug fit and does what it is suppose to do. This bag fits my needs perfectly. Even if it would hold an extra shield I would probably not store one inside for fear it may become scratched or damaged in some way. Shields are too expensive to be messed with too much when not attached to a helmet. I keep my extra shields in my closet in a box designed for that.
You'll notice that all the five star reviews go back a couple of years when this bag was obviously made of nylon/canvas and was a quality product.  Since then, the manufacturer has changed it into a cheap piece of plastic material that looks for all the world like a large, and admittedly reinforced, Hefty bag.  It's plastic inside and out with some type of reinforcing fiber woven through it.  Feels like it's about 6-7mil thick.  The accompanying warnings about adding a down piece to your tailpipe should be well heeded because even with the exhaust 7-8 inches away, it will melt this product.Speaking of melting, I have serious doubts about the durability of this product in extreme cold - it will either become too stiff to work with or crack, neither a desirable outcome.  About the only good thing I can say is that it is obviously waterproof with a good zipper system built into it.  Unfortunately, I had to keep it because I actually took it out of the box, thinking that maybe the inside was canvas and they had moved the plastic coating to the outside for better weather protection.  Well, once it's out of the box and opened, I  defy any normal human to roll it back up to the size to fit back in the box!Oh, and the picture of the box it came in is not representative of what is inside the box.  So, Amazon is simply using the advertising literature provided by the manufacturer although they should still remove it from their inventory (or sell it for the $25 it's obviously worth).  Find yourself a higher quality product that will last for more than a few trips and if it costs a little more, in the end it will be worth it.  Unfortunately for me, this is one of the very few products that is the correct size for my rear hitch carrier.Late edit:While the product remains questionable, Amazon came through in their typical customer oriented fashion and made it good with me.  They also promised to look into the issues with the item and delete it from their inventory if appropriate.this hose feels really sturdy, used it to fix old boat (sold it though), fix transmission and steering lines in cars. this is high quality hose, made in USAExactly what it does. Designed to be light weight, affordable, and reliable. Except that it should only be used in emergency situations. Situations where you walk out of a store to realize your car wont start. This will have enough power to jump start these kind of scenarios. It WILL NOT jump start a car thats been sitting for a month and the battery has been drained to nothing. Its not designed to do that. The light in the front is useless and isnt even LED, BUT it doubles as a cigarette lighter type 12v socket to charge up a phone or whatever. Dont lose the charger, it costs half the price of the actual jump box and is a very non standard voltage.Would give it 5 stars, if it had a more standard 2 prong or 3 prong standard wall outlet plug for charging. but overall. its good to have in the trunk for those just in case moments.
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.Accutire MS-5550 is perfect to fit in the trunk of a car/van for those times when an air compressor is needed.  It has the standard adaptors for sports balls, air mattress inflatables etc, and the standard locking valve stem connector.  This works well on bikes and the inflatables.  Car tires take more time to inflate or get up to pressure.  Power for this little compressor comes from the 12 volt outlet in the car/van.  There is good length on the power cord and depending where the 12 volt outlet is on your vehicle it will reach to the car's tires.  Light weight and easy to use make this ideal for carrying around.  The problem with this is that on flat surfaces the compressor doesn't stand still when started.  It will walk around. Gauges are small and hard to read and there didn't seem to be a light for night time reading.  This is basically something to add to the traveling safety kit or to have on hand for those emergency bike tire inflating times.  Made of plastic that feels cheap.  I'm betting this would not take much of a drop to break.  With so many better compressors out on the market today, I can only moderately recommend this one.  It will work but there are better ones, Black & Decker comes to mind, and not for that much more money.Motion Pro Cable LuberThe latest version of this tool has TWO thumb screws.I purchased this tool because it was recommended as a basic tool for maintaining your motorcycle or any other vehicle/device that uses cables. Well, after talking to some experienced riders, they all exclaimed that lubricating the cable (clutch or throttle) is a good idea, but they generally have never done this in over 20-30 years. Looking at the latest motorcycles, the cables don't really allow you to lubricate them using this tool or any tool for that matter. On my Ducati, there are rubber boots that prevent you from injecting lube into the sheath assuming you can use the tool and reach the sheath. On my Ford, the throttle cable sheath isn't thick enough to form a tight seal with the Motion Pro tool. It almost seems like the OEMs don't want you to lubricate the cables. On top of it, modern cars and the latest motorcycles use drive-by-wire which is totally electronic where your throttle input (pedal or twist grip) is connected to a potentiometer that tells the computer your desired throttle angle/input, and it activates a stepper motor that opens/closes the throttle plates accordingly. So if you're interested in maintaining your new bike or car with this tool, you might want to reconsider buying the tool.If you have a vehicle that uses cables and has a sheath that is accessible and large enough to form a seal, this tool is very easy to use and well made. Just slide the cable through the slit, push the tool up against the sheath entrance, clamp down the screws, and insert your lubricant nozzle/tube into the open port. Then use rags to seal the tool and the exit of the cable sheath, and squirt away.Overall: 4/5 stars, the rubber seal could have been designed to accommodate really skinny cable sheaths. Newer bikes and cars don't need/can't use this tool.
Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good LuckCareful you don't drop the adapters when prying the package open (don't ask).  Product seems to fit well but time will tell.Makes seal very slick and shiney should do a great job protecting the rubber seals, dont know how long it will last untill it has to be reapplied, but will let you know
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckThe lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.
I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.
Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon.a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Nice looking product with the black coating.  Only fits the 2 inch receivers though.  It will be put to use on another vehicle!Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truckgood bungies, nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch, thin but protective and fit a Dyna Glide without windshield very wellDesigned for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.
Bulk hose, what else is needed to say? Right size and fuel rated. Now to add words so they accept it as being long enough.Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is.This air deflector makes the air go to the side.  That's all it does.1. There are 2 pieces and no printed instructions - just the box where you can see how to assemble.2.  The 2 pieces fit together by grooves.  Slide and you can adjust by pulling/pushing to get it to fit on vent.3.  Magnets to hold this on vent.  The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance.I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.
Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard.If you decide to get this I also rcomend you get some lengths of gutter, at least 2 pieces, you can lay in on the expanded matrix so the gutter hose will not fall between the expanded sectiond.  So this and you have a great working system.If you work on dirty/greasy stuff, you need this.Gritty, to get the grunge out of your fingerprints/creases, doesn't smell odd, and it dissolves grease like you would not believe.  One cleaning, and you're likely done, even if your hands could double as pumpkin lube. (automotive reference)
This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.Bought for an APO address and free shipping, couldn't beat it. When you twist off the bottle cap the remaining ring easily falls off, so be careful if you pour directly into your oil reservoir, don't want the plastic ring falling in with the oil. But use a funnel and you won't have the problem. Will buy again.Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.
Use this for oil changes on my Subaru BRZ and it works great. Just stick the extension that has a smaller tube size right into the dip stick tube.fits perfectly in  one side of the rv double sink.  Additionally can sit on the Tray and drain into the sink as well.Due to size does not hold many dishes but adequate for my useSizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...
handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer.When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine.Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them.
Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.One side goes to your propane cylinder and other side goes to your regulator.  Make sure you put some pipe dope on the 1/4"  to seal it or yellow gas tape.Easy to put on, just move it into place and and snap it in.However, it depends on two clips on the bottom that are fairly thin. If you force it instead of maneuvering it into place, those clips with break and it won't stay on.
I purchased these this past Summer when they are at their cheapest, and used them yesterday (1/2/2014). The roads got worse and worse until cars were literally sliding sideways off the road due to ice, and the snow was still falling fast. I found a (relatively) safe place to pull over, in front of another vehicle with headlights on to help me put them on, got back on the road then I navigated the icy hills and curves with no problem at all. Other cars were doing crazy things all around me. I used mine for 11 miles, the last 9 of which were plowed/salted (didn't feel like taking them off). They were on as tight at the end as the beginning. The ride is very bumpy if you're not going over packed ice and snow.Of course when I got them I tried them to make sure they fit OK, which they did. Some listings have more than one application for the same size tire. If your tire size is one of these, this is a clue that you really have to be careful about fit.After using them, rinse with tap water and then lay them out under a lamp to dry. Then spray them with FluidFilm to prevent rust. You can use WD40 to help get them dry, but it will do nothing to prevent rust beyond that.Pro-Tips:1. Order in Spring or Summer for best price.2. Install one in nice weather. Paint the connector segment that corresponds to ideal tension a bright color.3. Put a pair of work gloves in the box with the chains. Disposable heavy duty rubber gloves are best because they have enough feel to do the connections.4. Keep a tarp, or use a floor mat while installing in bad weather. (I keep a small tarp under a floor mat)5. To install easily, put on top of tire and then push all the way over onto the axle. Pull the far side connector back and hook it up, then pull it back over tire and install near side connector.6. I found that 4 (2 sets) of SC1030 will just fit in one box, if you lay them all on top of each other and roll them up together. This may vary by model.Finally, putting on chains in bad weather is a hassle, taking them off once you reach a plowed road is a hassle, and there will always be bad reviews from folks who got the wrong size (for whatever reason). But when the roads are icy and crazy, there's no substitute, not even studded Winter Tires will do as well.We put these on the awning on our 5th wheel, you need a ladder and it takes awhile to slide them all in the track. The other downside is you have to take the S hooks out every time you roll it up, if you get caught in a pop up storm good luck! But once they are up they work great.I purchased the 18" Anco Winter blade because I needed a good wiper for my primary winter vehicle a 1994 Ford Bronco 4x4.  What's the use of 4 wheels in the snow if you can't see where you're going?  These blades proved to be excellent!  I was amazed, especially since I was reluctant to purchase these seeing as the "normal" anco blades haven't held up for me very well over the years.  I put them on right before either the first snowfall of the year or before it gets really cold.  No sense busting your knuckles, especially when its 0 degrees outside when the pain seems to multiply 10 fold.  lol.  I bought a set end of 2010, took them off when the weather improved and switched them to my "summer blades" and I just recently put the same set of winter blades from last year back on.  Tested them out, still work like new!  What is nice about these blades is the fact that they do not stiffen up with the extreme cold and they do not form ice on them when you use your windshield washer like the metal ones do.  We all know its a pain and dangerous bashing your wipers against your windshield just to get them working right again.  Which these seem to eliminate.  I would recommend them to anyone who has to drive in adverse cold weather conditions.Tips:Put them on before it gets cold/snowy.  No sense waiting until last minute and suffering!If they still work, SAVE THEM!  Use them only when needed through the winter season.  I stored mine in the garage through the summer.If you save them, wipe them down with a towel or cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol before putting them on.  This cleans off road grime and restores them to maximum performance.  A lot of reviewers complained about streaks, etc.  Unless the blade is physically damaged this can be fixed by doing so.If for whatever reason in extreme cold they do freeze, don't bang them and definitely do not try picking or scraping the ice off of them.  This will damage them for sure.  What I do is take some prestone windshield deicer and carefully spray them down a little.  Works wonders, just watch your paint.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThese will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Nice looking product with the black coating.  Only fits the 2 inch receivers though.  It will be put to use on another vehicle!This strainer works, but can't fit even full size plates! It also is very flimsy. I would find another one!
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.It is exactly as it is advertised. It seems well built. If this is what you need just buy it.What can I say, it's a funnel.  Does the job as expected. Has a nice large fill hole so the liquids go in quickly.
32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus.Red line ATF/ MTF for my 02 C5 Z06!!!now I can push my z06 knowing my tranny is good to go!It's a great product, however, it would not fit my Honda Shadow VT750 disc brake.It supposedly has 10mm holes in the disc brake, but for some reason the pin just won't fit!Otherwise it looks like a good product!I've used the 5mm pin for my scooters; however my motorcycle now has to do without lock.
3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter.CONS: This bag is very snug and somewhat difficult to fit my helmet into. But I will also mention that I wear a XL ICON Domain II helmet that has a little spoiler kind of hanging off the top of the helmet. Does not have enough room to store an extra shield.PROS: Made very well and offers a good degree of protection without being too bulky. The price was very good.SUMMARY: Would I buy this bag again? Yes. I like a bag that does not take up a lot of space, has a snug fit and does what it is suppose to do. This bag fits my needs perfectly. Even if it would hold an extra shield I would probably not store one inside for fear it may become scratched or damaged in some way. Shields are too expensive to be messed with too much when not attached to a helmet. I keep my extra shields in my closet in a box designed for that.bought this for my CRV originally. now still works with my Honda Pilot. has lasted 5+ years and still going strong. holds the front weight of the car easily. just line it up right and drive slowly up the ramp. it can take a beating and is very hard plastic.i can change my own oil now easily and for dirt cheap yet high quality.extremely satisfied. would highly recommend. (if you are tight on a budget just park half on a curb and it should give enough space underneath, but this lets you do it in your own garage in a much nicer fashion)ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO HAVE WHEN CHANGING OIL:- a couple jack stands (i always use this as a backup as never good to have a car fall on you)- 4 tire chocks to prevent rear tires from moving by accident (always use parking brake as well)- socket wrench (walmart extendable one is solid)- oil and oil filter- gloves and lots of newspaper to prevent oil messes (definitely will be some)- oil pan (walmart has a solid large one. the bigger the better. should have built in spout)- about 1 hr of time... drive it around a bit first to warm up oil so it flows faster, careful as it will be hot)- channellock tongue and groove plier in case you need help to remove the oil filter (it is crazy tight initially but doesn't have to be)
I needed a chamois for my car. I got a chamois for my car. A chamois, is a chamois, is a chamois. I needed a chamois for my car. I got a chamois for my car. A chamois, is a chamois, is a chamois.Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck.  I like this one.  Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality.Replaced my Suburban Anode with this one. Fits correctly and is a good replacement at a cheaper cost. Why pay more.Update: I've used this for the season. It been working great.
The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob.It is great. I just add it to the reservoir along with the regular washer fluid.  It does work very close to the original spray, so i won't say no to it.  The repellent effects stay on and does the job well. Buy it.
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!K&N is a good,name, so since I have not installed it yet but I am sure it will live up to it's reputation . The pricing was much better than the lower end filters, I will buy another if pricing is similar to what I paid for this one.Will work great for what I bought it for.Haven't used it yet and will post if it turns out to be a pos.
This is a tough unit and critical to clean the windows of my RV and truck.  I am glad I bought the 'used' one -- couldn't tell it wasn't brand new!  The unit is a little heavy - but that's good for what it does.  I wish I could adjust the angle of the step plate though... right now when mounted it actually is ~10* dropped from level and I would not want to slip off this thing (but the louvers will preclude that from happening I suspect).This is OBD2 and CAN.  My truck is 1996 F150 OBD2.  It only gives codes and does not detail the code meanings.  I do not find this a trouble.  Code interpretations are all over the internet and auto forums.  It is easy to use and cheap.  I bought this from a knowledgeable guy's recommendation from f150forum.com.  I did not research this further, I just wanna plug and play.Not the best. I put this in the back of my pickup, covered by a topper, to run a 12v cooler during the summer. I put groceries in the cooler from store to home.Instal is straight forward. The black wire grounds directly to the box with a sheet metal screw. I ran a hot from the battery + via 10ga to the red and spliced them together.The unit is one piece, plastic. I used body tape to stick this to the pickup box and drilled holes for two sheet metal screws. So far, it holds well and works. I get the feeling this will not last as long as I want as it seems a little cheaply made. Then again, it was cheap so I am not expecting great things from it.
NICE PRODUCT DOES WHAT IS MEANT TO DO. THE TAPE SEEMS TO HOLD PRETTY GOOD ONLY TIME WILL TELL SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ALONG TIME AGO.GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS.BOUGTH THESE WITH THE THOUGHT OF REPLACING CLEANING CLOTHS OR RAGS AS THEY ARE BETTER KNOWNTHESE ACTUALLY DO THE JOB AND THE PRICE IS GREAT
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RV
Got this to replace the stock Thermostat on my 99 Jeep XJ. Stock one is 195 degree, but I like my engine to run a little cooler. Worked great.No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.This is a standard replacement for your air filter in your vehicle.  In my case, it was for my Jeep Liberty.
Considering these stands cost about four times as much as a lot of others, and considering the five star reviews, I was expecting perfection.  Unfortunately, they have design flaws.First, the packing sucks.  Two stands come packed together in one box with bits of cardboard that are supposed to prevent the two stands and the two separated stand arms from rubbing together.  I'm not sure if they scraped through the cardboard or if it just shifted, but all of my stands have scrapes on them and in one place the metal is rusting where the paint was scraped.  The manual says if you see rust to scrape it off and repaint it.  I shouldn't have to do that when they're new due to bad packing.  Also, the scrapes reveal just how imperceptibly thin the paint actually is.The description says "Formed base adds stability and helps reduce sinkage into pavement".  When I think "formed base" I think formed as one solid piece.  Instead, the base has tiny triangles of metal welded to the _inside_ of each foot.  Then they carefully take a picture of the stand so you can't see what they did till you get it.  That would still be acceptable except they made no effort to level either the feet or the triangles.  On many of the feet, the triangle sits too deep in the foot so it wouldn't even touch the pavement until the foot edge had dug into the pavement.  In other cases, an edge of a crooked triangle will form a divot in the pavement before the rest of the foot or triangle touches ground.  They could have splurged for a tiny bit more metal to make the triangles large enough to rest the edge of each foot on the triangle, then set the whole thing on a flat surface while the triangles were welded.  I've seen other stands with that design.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the arm that locks the stands at a particular height doesn't move very far and so it's hard to tell by looking if the lock is engaged.  I agree this is a problem and I wish the teeth were deeper so it was easier to tell when a locking arm was fully engaged.  However, it's probably not really an issue because the weight of the yellow bar and the shape of the teeth and locking bar will force the locking bar to fully engage.  Even if the locking bar is rusty enough to prevent the weight of the yellow bar from fully locking it, the weight of the car certainly will.  I could possibly imagine a case where the tip of the locking bar is barely touching a tooth of the yellow bar and putting weight on the yellow could cause a failure, but I couldn't get it to sit like that when trying, so it's pretty unlikely.  However, as the jacks get rusty and teeth possibly wear, or if you simply get one with a small manufacturing defect, such a situation could become more likely.  So I'm not a fan of this design where locking can't easily be confirmed visually.  Even if they had made it so the locking arm sits perfectly horizontal while locked and an inch off horizontal when unlocked it would have been better.While doing my tests with the locking bar I created quite a bit of shaved yellow paint particles just from moving the yellow bar up and down by hand.  This is probably typical of the paint used on jack stands and maybe there's no avoiding it, but it certainly doesn't seem that they used any sort of premium paint.  The coating of yellow paint does seem to be thicker than the coating of blue paint, at least.I don't think the description (or the 3-ton label on each stand) makes it very clear that the 3 ton rating is per PAIR, not per stand.  You have to read the manual to find that out.  They also have big warnings in two places in the manual not to put a car on four stands.  Since it's fairly common for people to put cars onto four jack stands, I don't know if that warning is just there to cover their butts in case someone lifts a car wrong onto four stands and it falls over during lifting or if there's something about these particular stands that makes them bad for using four at once.  Perhaps the bases are just too small.  Of course, using four stands in earthquake country is just asking for trouble so that could be another reason.In case anyone was wondering, these stands only lock at a particular position.  Just because the description says "ratchet" doesn't mean you can ratchet them up while the car's weight is on them.  If you manage to move the locking bar with the car's weight on the stand (which actually shouldn't be possible due to the shape of the teeth), the stand will collapse to its lowest level.K&N; have apparently moved their production to Mexico. Older filters of this same type have been made in the U.S.A. I don't immediately notice any quality difference, and the "Mexican" types are sealed in cellophane inside the cardboard box.  This is good, because in a humid environment, if you stock up the shelf of the garage like I do, small traces of surface rust can form on unprotected threads.  I have one of the U.S.A. ones left, and I'll open this one up to more fully compare gaskets, construction, and measurements between the two. Will update.Note: Avoid the "PS" series of K&N.; Inferior quality, not worth the slight price difference.----UPDATE----The center threaded disc that spins onto the post of your vehicle's filter mount has some glue or sealant in the transition between the disc and the rest of the filter's base. I cleaned it off, but am a little disappointed, since the stuff could have come off on its own and circulated through the engine. Maybe it would eventually be caught by the filter, or maybe the particles would just lodge somewhere in the engine.  Not good.  Never saw this on the U.S.A. made filters, and the company had better keep a tight handle on quality control in case other manufacturing issues turn up.This problem is not serious enough to downgrade my initial 4-star rating.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.
I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy!I have an army 6x6, 6 wheel nuts per wheel...each two piece wheel bolted together with 15 nuts at 400 ft/lbs.  A couple wheels had some air leaks, and they need to be disassembled.  It would have been a bear to remove these nuts without the ant-seize.  I use this on every bolt in every application.  Big bolts, little bolts and it does a great job of protecting threads that are exposed to weather.I've only used this twice on a '98 Ford Explorer with a factory roof rack, but it sure has come in super handy and fit exactly up there!  During my last camping trips, I was able to fit 5 camping chairs, a 6 person tent, and a cot inside.  There was still some extra space to stuff smaller items in but I'm always in a hurry to load stuff in last minute so I didn't have time to play tetris or toy around with adjusting the straps for more slack space.  It hasn't rained on it yet, but looking at the zipper flaps, I'm sure it'll hold up well to water.  My rack only has the front and rear bars, but it has these small D rings on the sides which I removed the strap buckles, slid the strap through a hole, put the buckles back on, and tightened.  So far nothing has shifted even on sharp turns.  Oh, and there is no noise driving at 70mph.
This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top.Easy to put on, just move it into place and and snap it in.However, it depends on two clips on the bottom that are fairly thin. If you force it instead of maneuvering it into place, those clips with break and it won't stay on.Works really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored.
I use this in our travel trailer. It's a good fit on the counter, but the stand needs to be a bit taller to be able to slope the water toward the sink, so I end up propping the end up a bit. I don't use it for storing since it's an open grate on the bottom and don't want to chance spilling any detergent or soap during transit.I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections.I purchased these this past Summer when they are at their cheapest, and used them yesterday (1/2/2014). The roads got worse and worse until cars were literally sliding sideways off the road due to ice, and the snow was still falling fast. I found a (relatively) safe place to pull over, in front of another vehicle with headlights on to help me put them on, got back on the road then I navigated the icy hills and curves with no problem at all. Other cars were doing crazy things all around me. I used mine for 11 miles, the last 9 of which were plowed/salted (didn't feel like taking them off). They were on as tight at the end as the beginning. The ride is very bumpy if you're not going over packed ice and snow.Of course when I got them I tried them to make sure they fit OK, which they did. Some listings have more than one application for the same size tire. If your tire size is one of these, this is a clue that you really have to be careful about fit.After using them, rinse with tap water and then lay them out under a lamp to dry. Then spray them with FluidFilm to prevent rust. You can use WD40 to help get them dry, but it will do nothing to prevent rust beyond that.Pro-Tips:1. Order in Spring or Summer for best price.2. Install one in nice weather. Paint the connector segment that corresponds to ideal tension a bright color.3. Put a pair of work gloves in the box with the chains. Disposable heavy duty rubber gloves are best because they have enough feel to do the connections.4. Keep a tarp, or use a floor mat while installing in bad weather. (I keep a small tarp under a floor mat)5. To install easily, put on top of tire and then push all the way over onto the axle. Pull the far side connector back and hook it up, then pull it back over tire and install near side connector.6. I found that 4 (2 sets) of SC1030 will just fit in one box, if you lay them all on top of each other and roll them up together. This may vary by model.Finally, putting on chains in bad weather is a hassle, taking them off once you reach a plowed road is a hassle, and there will always be bad reviews from folks who got the wrong size (for whatever reason). But when the roads are icy and crazy, there's no substitute, not even studded Winter Tires will do as well.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!This comes with 4 rubber feet that you install on the bottom.  Each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of RV stoves.  The board itself has pre-drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove.  It's a very well-done product.  The feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove.  The finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place.  Highly recommend.Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror.
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Measured my front and rear tires.  Front 6/32, rear 8/32.  Time to rotate.Accuracy is cleaverly done by putting the numbers around the barrel so accuracy is increased because numbers are spread apart.  Mechanically simple and small to fit in glove commpartment.Can't imagine any advantage to paying more for such a simple tool when this one works so well.  Quality is medium but more than sufficient for this purpose.  Only a few measurements needed for tires.  This tools is the one to buy.The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes.
This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Pretty dam heavy duty, has the air bleed screw at the top.I inserted a half used tube of grease cartilage, the royal purple 14.5 oz, no issue primed it following the instructions and its oozes out with ease
The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.The Amazon description says it holds six quarts.  The stamped information on the bottom of mine says seven quarts.  From experience, I'd say it holds well over 6 but not quite 7 quarts.The cap seals nice and tight -- I have no worries about putting it in my trunk (full of oil) to tote it to Pep Boys for oil disposal.  (Although I wrap it in a trash bag just in case.)The funnel attaches well and stores away easily, even with oily hands.  There's a kind of a four-sided grate over the funnel hole that may stand a chance of catching a washer or drain bolt before it falls in.  The grate can also be used to tighten and twist off the funnel.It's made of thick, strong plastic that seems as if will last for a very long time.  It is extremely low to the ground, and fits easily both under my Honda and my riding mower.For those people who think the funnel is too small -- I don't share the concern.  If your car's drain bolt is more than a foot or so higher than the funnel, perhaps you need to sit the container on a cinder block or something to raise it.  Part of my oil change toolkit is a chain like the kind you find on pens at the bank (see attached link).  I use it like a plumb line to ensure that the funnel is well under the drain bolt.MMF Industries Secure-A-Pen Ballpoint Counter Pen with Base, Black Ink, Medium (28904)
excellent grease gun! easy to load, easy to use and the longer hose is great!got it quick, works great love it ,easy to read nice and small easy to carry and easy to store.Easy to install, small footprint and saves cabinet space.  Very practical and functional and I really like the straightforward, easy access.
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor.I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.
This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have.Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer.....

That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.

This is not the exact same cable that comes with the ScanGauge from LinearLogic, but it does the job. I would buy it again.This is an effective, simple design that does exactly what it claimes to do. The feel is rather "cheap" but it works well enough. One word of caution, depending upon your door, the instructions may be in the opposite (ie, upside down) so check before drilling the hole. Otherwise, this is effective but should probably cost a fraction of the selling price...it's dubious as to the long term durability. However, since there aren't any other solutions on the market, it gets four stars for doing what it is intended to do which is open the door without having to hassle with the slider.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.
A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.Exaclty the same as the OEM filter I dug out of the glove box. This one was the exact same but so much cheaper.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.This is a great product for the money.  The pump is relatively fast, the inverter works well.  Has a great charge indicator gauge.  Make sure you have the master switch off while charging.  Charge it 48 hours the first time.  Periodically charge it once every 3 months.  There isn't a good place to sy=tore the AC adapter, or 12 charging cord. It comes with adapters to inflate your basketball, or other items.
put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions.Precise sizes since they weren't listed in any description: .045 .080 .050 .040 .060 .044I used to gap 4 NGK Iridium IX spark plugs. The tool's metal didn't bend. Would buy again.I think meguiars is the best product for the price on the market today, you cant go wrong with all of the items they sell just read the directions first.
This accessory makes it easy for one person to fill up the RV water tank.  The clear hose stays in the tank filler neck and the shut-off valve puts water control where you need it.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.If you have a camper water heater like mine its almost impossible to get a wrench on the drain plug.  This solves the problem.
If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.this is the main belt tensioner, i used to replace on a 2005 suburban with 110,000 milles. the part is a good quality original equiptment part. Save yourself some money and do it yourself. in addition to this i also replaced belts (used Goodyear Gatorback) and other tensioners and idler pully bought on amazon.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!This filter fits perfectly and provides much needed outside air filtration. It remains to be seen how well it holds during allergy season.Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.
this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.
Does the job for which it was intended. Added to HOT water and dissolved, pour it into the base of the Air-O-Swiss humidifier to clean any 'scaling' and other 'old water' contaminants. Then thoroughly rinse (without dunking the base under water) and do this about every 2 months.Speeds up the fresh water tank fill process.  It also speeds up filling the portable water jugs during dry camping.  It's really convenient to be able to turn the water on/off right at the jug.Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommend
Everyone knows fixaflat!Press it on your tire air valve, and let it fill up.Then fill up the tire with air (eg: by driving to the gas station).Ride around for a while, so the slime can settle.And voila! New life in an old tire!Don't use in a new tire, when you can plug it!I built a counsel in my Motor home where a old CRT TV was taking up way to much room for this old man to crawl over to get to the drivers seat.  I have GPS, Backup Camera, Satellite radio two cell phones a i-Pod and i-Pad to keep charged, so I am in need of a lot of power in my counsel.  These double power outlets ought to do the trick, plus I am turning one of the outlets into a double USB port for charging also.I have to tell anyone interested I love Amazon, they deliver so fast, quicker than I can go to the store in a lot of cases, one of the pleasures of living in a small town.how can you not like JB weld products, easily mixed lasts a long time in the tubes even after opening.  I used this for a bunch of stuff all the way from filling small pits in steel to filling holes.
This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.Don't buy this unit. Buy Camco 39062 RV Dual Flush Pro Holding Tank Rinser with Gate Valve instead.  This unit will let you back flush but guess what happens when you want to disconnect the hose.I guess it's only good for connecting a hose for extending the drain...
this stuff cleaned my intake filter like a charm! next time i will buy an aerosol version though as this one is kind of dirty to use :)Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!This blade works great however you need to know a few things.  The ice will destroy it over time if you try and run this + windshield washer fluid in the winter on an uncleared windshield.  If you at using this in the rain/show though it will work great.  Another thing is that you can't use rain-x with this it will cause smearing.
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.
I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .I have a GM 1995 OBDI engine and the adapter they shipped for GM did not fit my connector so I had to return the whole unit.  I'm now back to grounding out the data pin and watching the flash code on the check engine light for trouble codes.  It's important to check your adapter fit before purchase since that's what you will rely on to get the data into the unit.I liked the unit's design - it came in two zipper bags that zipped together to hold the cables and adapters in one bag and hold the tool and book in a separate pouch.  You can also unzip one zipper and lay them side by side to go in a tool box drawer.I wish the adapter would have fit my vehicle - if it did I would have kept this unit because of all the features it offers.I just ordered this for my new trailer but I installed it about 8 years ago on my last trailer and it works like a charm. This is so easy to use at dump stations or at sites to clean out tanks. I simply attach the hose to it and turn it on and it will spray the inside of the tank and well as fill it fast to dump it out clean. We travel all summer and fast means everything when the families packed and ready to pull out.If you are handy ((I would rate this install on a scale of 1 to 10 for difficulty a 5)) you can install it to your tank. My last trailer the black tank was exsposed under trailer so it was super easy. Just drill down 2 inches from top of tank at opposite end (if you can) of drain out with a 1-1/4 inch wood type drill. Anu central location of tank will be fine.Then add silicon around hole insert sparyer and screw in 3 screws. Thats the hardest part. Then you run the hose from tank to the side of the trailer and screw that in. Once the silicon drys your all set. I never had a problem with it leaking ever and I used it hard for 8 summers. Does a great job!My new trailer the tanks are enclosed under a plastic type covering which I had to pull off one side 10 feet to get to tanks. It was not really that big a deal and the covering screwed back up like new. Maybe someone less handy may want to see whats involved on their unit 1st to see what it will take to install.UPDATE JUNE 2013. I just bought A motorhome and 1st thing I did was install flush to black tank and like always works like a charm!!!It also says right on package If it starts to leak find Alan wrench and tighten inside it may come a little loose and drip, no big deal.This product will make your life so easy specially when your in line at a dump station and want to rinse your tank and get moving.
I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular.Toyota offers two OEM air filter: standard and high-quality.  I'd place the Fram filter somewhere in between those.  If you're not up to removing your glove compartment; you might want to have the dealer install an OEM filter.  On Toyota's, it's fairly simple to replace the cabin filter and it only takes a few minutes.  This filter reduces the airflow so the fan has to work harder than it did with the standard OEM filter.  This is the first cabin filter replacement in 7 years and my old filter wasn't that dirty.  I don't drive on dirt roads so I don't need to change cabin air filters that often.This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast.
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance.Amazon's website says the 15" version of this wiper will fit on a 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  That is not really true.  This wiper was "backwards" what my Cayenne required and I had to spend 15 minutes reversing the rubber to get it to fit the Cayenne.If you have a Porsche Cayenne, try something else.I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle.
Try to find a cabin air filter of this quality  anywhere near the price that it is being sold on Amazon. Replacement is easy (it's in the glove compartment) and your Honda  owners manual will show you how to do it.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.Both the stock photo, and the J.Koster JPG you see of this product are no longer valid, and whatyou get is what my JPG shows.The product has been cheapened by shortening the wires by half (now 1 foot)by the time you spread the wires apart enough for the clamps to reach bothterminals on a standard sized 12 volt car battery, you have just taken up halfthe wire length which leaves you 6 inches left over.I have not stripped the insulation of the wires to check gauge, but it can't be anymorethan 18; 16 at the most.While the product does work, you would have to use it right on top of the battery, which isOK for me, as I only use it for test purposes.As far as the whole "Front panel illumination" line, I can't figure out why that is in theproduct blurb!The product comes in a cheap clear plastic bag, NOT A THERMAL FORMED PACK! as is shown, sothe product you see is not the product you get.Again, see my JPG of what you ACTUALLY GET.Due to the low price, it is not worth returning, but you should be aware of these changes.
I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them)..This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch.Installed these on the front corners of the travel trailer. Works great. Saves me from having to run around with the bubble level checking to see if the trailer is level front to back and side to side. Seem to stick pretty well also. Very Happy so far. Fast ship from Amazon.
This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag.Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too.I went through several different shades trying to find one that would fit a large windshield.  The Basic Jumbo shade fits the bill, plus it folds up nicely.  If you have a large truck, van, or other vehicle that has a large windshield, then this product will likely fulfill your needs.  Since this is actually two different pieces, you can place them horizonallty or vertically.  The only downside is that there is no opening for a mirror, but I find that these go over the mirror and are easily held up with the sunvisors.The material is thin, but appears to be very strong.  The shields fold up into a small circle (about 12" across) for storage.  Unfold slightly and they pop out into their full size and shape.  To fold them back, just bend in slightly and turn your wrists.  They bounce right back into the small circles.
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back.I bought this, set the code by turning the screw inside the front of the unit, and sprayed with a silicone lubricant.After a month on the front bumper, in the WA rain, there's no sign of rust and the inside tray is dry.The thumb-wheels turn easily and front face plate is tight.I can't find fault with this and it seems pretty secure.Since I can't predict when and where I might lock myself out of the truck, I just leave this on the front receiver by CURT where it fit's just fine with the smallest gasket.I'm very happy with this purchase.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.
The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day.Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking.It worked perfectly to remove the spark plugs. the grip part is left visible when inserted in the spark plug hole, so, you can continue removing or adjusting the spark plug with hand. good tool, right size.

The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.
I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses.Tried it on my 2007 Aveo with no known problems. It detected zero codes. Hooked it up to my 2000 Sienna with a check light and it prompted a code(PO0135) to replace my oxygen sensor. Did that and rechecked it with no codes. You need a code reader instead of replacing every sensor! How do you erase the codes with the erase button? I tried with the erase button with no avail. I ended up just disconnecting the negative battery cable for five minutes. I replaced the battery cable and started the van up. Low and behold, No More Check Engine Light. This small entry level, pocket size code reader did the job. The OB-2 hook up for the van is under the dash near the steering wheel. Paid for itself with one code reading compared to having the shop do it. I'm glad that I bought this in the comfort of my home with Amazon instead of driving around in traffic.I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.
I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware.We have tested a few chargers for fleet use - this being the best one I tested.I have a fleet of Ford E250 vans, mostly 2004, 2006-2008 models.  I have jumped at least 10 vans with this on a single charge.  The 10th van had zero juice in the battery (not enough to even dimmly power the cab light or even get a flicker on the dash), and it fired right up without any charge time.My ONLY complain is the charger leads do not grip well onto GM side post batteries (we have some '02 and '04 GMC 2500 vans as well).  It works but you have to work to make a connection.This jumps far better than some other brands we have tried and I am recommending that we purchase several more for our fleet.Installed this yesterday. It is a great low tech solution to placing vehicle at exactly the same place every time. I looked at several other options using radio frequencies and lasers. Decided on this option, nothing to go wrong.Others complained of movement of the parking mat. I have not had this installed long enough to evaluate performance concerning slippage. I did carefully clean the area with a powerful solvent before installation as garage floors are likely to have an oily coating. I will update this posting later as necessary.2/17/14I have epoxy paint on my garage floor which could result in the sticky stuff not working. After carefully cleaning the area with a good solvent the mat has not moved. I even hit the rear stop hard to see if it would move. The wife loves it. Highly recommended if installed properly.3/16/14Still exactly where I put it without using any thing other than the supplied double stick tape. Cleaning the installation area carefully is critical. I used lacquer thinner.
If you have a high lift jack this is a must have.  You know you will need this in the worst of situations and this will provide better floatation in soft soil and sand.If you want this in chrome type the letter C infront of it in your search.  I love the welded nut option it is a life saver for motorcycles or small engine bays.Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento.
Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.What can I say, it installed and is functioning as a thermostat is designed to do. I did go from OEM 195 to this 180 but I won't get into the reasons as that doesn't pertain to the installation and function of this thermostat.Do what as it says and you'll get the results you wanted. don't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint. otherwise, this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxing
Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersI used this wax on my Platinum Gray VW and the surface had a near perfect mirror reflection.  I will continue to use this waxI use this on all my auto bulbs. Helps when you need to remove bulbs especially on my trailers an vintage vehicles. This is a, Must Have Item. I recommend this Dielectric Grease.
This is a great product for the money. Works as described and easy to use. Highly recommend this to anyone does their own brake jobs.This product has been proven to work well. It does what it promises to do and very well. I recommend it to anyone.It is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy again
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Works good, installed on my 2012 Kaw Voyager 1700. I installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box. Use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work, sound awesome too.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
I used this to wrap the ehaust system on my 2004 Yamaha R6. Went on good and looks good against the black frame. Also keeps the heat down from buring the track plastics!I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.I stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by. It stuck to the fabric lining and works very well.
This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try.Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc.Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look!
Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery.

We use it for our automobile interiors and it cleans the leather without streaks or residue.  I haven't tried it on my home furniture, as I typically use Lexol for semi-aniline dyed leather furniture.
This has to be one of the best leather care products out there. I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone.Works well w/o darkening leather. Product suggestes using another cleaner first, this cleans and conditions. I have used on car interior and recliner w/ good results.Super soft and I'd say zero possibility of scratching.  I bought a new black car and use these with Meguiar's black wax.  Does an excellent job.
Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile.This came as described and shipped quickly. Good viscosity and easy to use it appears this will work well for assembly lube for my motor.Used it for my Lotus Elise.  It went in without any issues.  Fits well. Price was reasonable.  Will use it again.
I bought this as an extension for a tire-inflater and car vacuum where both plug into the 12V cigarette light socket.  With this, I can take the inflater and vacuum all around the vehicle with no worries.  I can even stretch it out and manage to use it for those items on another vehicle that's parked beside mine.  So, I'm please with it.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.I use it on a 17 foot Boston Whaler.  I connected it directly to the battery so I can use spot lights, other lighting, charge cell phones, etc.  Can't get any simpler.  Basically a piece of useful junk.  Recommend it.
product description is a little off - actual ingredients are: Mineral Oil, Petroleum Distillates, Calcium Oxide, Aluminum, Graphite.I was expecting a new twist on the standard copper anti-seize compound, just suprised there is no copper at all in it. still does a great job, so no real complaints.Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too.Like so many with Odyssey transmission problems, I tried this product as a last ditch effort.  It does appear to smooth the transmission to some degree, but it doesn't make the bigger issue with the shudder go away.  Obviously, this is not a miracle fluid and works within the boundaries of a somewhat normally function transmission. I believe my problem is with the torque converter, which this fluid cannot &#34;magically&#34; fix.
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products.You know those expensive "headlight restoration" kits you can get?  Well, you can actually use an abrasive polish (like this one) and achieve much the same result.  I use masking tape around the edges of my headlights, then use an orbital polisher with a firm pad to polish my headlights using this compound.  It's very adept at removing that thin layer of yellowish oxidation which makes headlights more opaque than clear.  Best of all, this bottle has a lot of compound in it and you could polish your headlights probably 75 times on one bottle before running out.So there is that... but it's also good on paint.Over the years I have found the best use of a rubbing compound is to either restore heavily oxidized finishes (with no clearcoat), or to remove paint/scuff deposits on a small area of your car.Be advised that this is a very abrasive compound and you should NOT use this as a general purpose polish for a newer car finish.  Every time you use this product you remove a tiny layer from your car's finish.  Remember that and use with caution.  If someone bumps into your new car in the parking lot and left a paint scuff, this is the ideal product to get it off with.  If you have an old car that's been sitting out in the sun too long and has faded a bit, you can use this product on the entire car to bring it back to its near-original shine by removing that layer of oxidation which makes it look dull.So whether you own a new car or old one, this is a great product to keep in the garage for detailing days.If you have never used a clay bar on your car - buy this kit.  You will be amazed at the results.
First, Permatex makes good products.  This is no different.  There are some products labeled similarly but do not contain true silicone in the same way this product does.This is useful for lubricating all sorts of things.  From moving parts you wish to keep lubricated such as door slides and hinges and other hardware such as that.  It will also help to prevent oxidation (rust) from occurring.  It is also very good for applying to plastic and rubber to both keep them with a film of lubricant which you might want on something such as "rubber" weatherstripping on the sides of car windows.  It is also good for for using to keep rubber, vinyl and most plastic parts from drying out.This is a product that goes on wet and while it will dry it will not completely evaporate but leave a protective film of silicone which is a good thing.This is not like products such as penetrating oils like Liquid Wrench or WD-40.  Those are good for their purpose but they are lighter lubricants made for penetrating and not leaving the same sort of film as this silicone spray.There are some items that could also be well lubricated with spray lithium grease but this has the advantage of being clear so it does not remain white so it is nice in that sense.The price here right now is significantly more expensive than the local auto parts store.  I would check prices before purchasing.  I love Amazon and sometimes they have the best price and certainly some of the best customer serviceyou will ever find but you do need to check prices as sometimes prices can be much higher (or lower) from place to place.As an aside, contrary to one persons review, this product is NOT an electrical conductor but just the opposite it is an insulator.It is contained in dielectric grease so do not get it on contacts of electronic products!  It can be used carefully on sockets for electronic connections to be used such as dielectric grease but do not get it on the actual metal contact parts themselves.  I tried to post a link to Wiki about silicone that explains this but Amazon does not allow which is why you see the dots in brackets instead.[...]There are other silicone sprays out there, some are also good, some are not.  Be careful to ensure you get what you are after.That is one thing good about Permatex products, they are a trustworthy company and their products are usually one of the best options for their purposes and they have a huge variety of products for very specific uses, most often in automotive products.  So this is a trustworthy brand that you know what you are getting is as described on the label and you are getting what you pay for.  Just make sure you pay the most reasonable price you can find.Again Amazon service was nothing short of amazing.Flares were well packaged, everything included, great directions for simple installation (and reading the instructions on these is well worth the time)Heavy duty thick material, not a cheap plastic design as I have seen from other manufactues.  These should hold up well in the future and down the road.They give perfect coverage to the 31x10.50x15 tires on my TJ and should be fine for at least up to 11.5 width coverage.These are almost identical to the ones I've rented from Autozone in the past.  I decided to get my own set for sheer convenience.  The work well for the passenger cars--don't know about any other type of coil springs.  Can be tricky on progressive springs with lots of coils on the ends. because you need to have room in between coils for these to fit.  Also, it should be obvious but these are to be applied on coils only.  Attaching one end to the strut mounts or top cap is a recipe for disaster.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Nice product, claims not to damage pressure senders, seems to be effective if puncture is in the tread.  Does not claim to work on sidewalls.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product.I was at our Good-Guys car show (with my show car) a few years ago and a (NAPA) dealer had this product for sale. They said try it and if you don't like it bring it right back and I'll give your money back. Well...I didn't and I have continued to use this for years since. This stuff is great and like others have stated really brings the new tire look without being too shiny. I used it on all the plastic and rubber parts to bring new life look back and also the colored plastic panels can bring the color back. None of it is permanent and tires need to be re done every other wash or so. I use the 'Eagle One Tire Swipe' applicator to apply the product or wipe it around for an even appearance. I have even used it sparingly on my Azek deck and keeps it looking sharp (but if too much can get slippery). Great product.I recently got the whole Ultimate Wax System and decided to give it a shot.This polish IS A PRE-WAX CLEANER.  It is very mild and will take off old wax and oxidation, but it will NOT remove most swirl marks and scratches. (Consider something else if you're looking to cure these pre-wax!).  This polish would be more beneficial on cars with old wax and/or oxidation.  On newer vehicles, although this is not necessary unless you want to remove any previous wax you might have done, it's still worth using just for a peace of mind kind of thing.  It'll help revitalize the color on oxidized paint and it'll enhance the depth and color of non-oxidized paint.On my car, a Mazda3 in Galaxy Grey Mica, there was no oxidized paint, but after using this polish, it brings out the color a little bit more via the clear coat.  It adds a little more depth and shine, making for a nice pre-wax prep.Worth giving it a shot, whether your car is oxidized or not!
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Used after clay bar treatment on brand new car. Wiped on easily, then wiped off easily with little effort. Used on a white car, so tricky to see where I had applied it and removed it (had to depend on reflections). Be sure to dampen the applicator first--MUCH easier. Used a Meguiar's microfiber applicator pad.
I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.Very pleased I prefer to disconect at the plug then remove the leads to protect the little charger and my battery . These work great .If I can on cars I like to use the one that goes bolts on so you just plug in through the grill making putting cars on the charger nightly a breeze .I cut this extention in half and either solder and use shrink tube or use but connectors with shrink tube and have used it on my bikes or vehicles ove the years as add on accessory disconnects. I use the red as positive and the white as negative and the exposed white connetor with the covered red connector to connect to the battery to protect the wire from shorting out.
Paired it with a black frame.  Covers the plate well and will protect it from sticker stealers...  Will see how it wears over time as it is plastic and they tend to craze over time.Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks.Would be good if it came in black also, to match what we head. However it does the job admirably well.
I love the product but wish I had followed the instructions on the Jafrum site rather than the ones on Amazon about sizing.  I ordered a size up per other reviews and they are a bit bigger than I would like.  I should have just gone with my gut.  Other than that, they are great quality chaps and an unbeatable price.  One review I read mentioned them smelling like a dead goat, mine have no odor at all.  Another review complained about the poor zipper quality, again mine have very heavy duty zippers and I have no problems there.  They fit great in the inseam with no trimming required, I wish I had ordered a size smaller so they wouldn't be so loose on my legs, and the waist was huge for my body but I made a new hole and all is good.  Even after tying the back as tight as it can go the waist was very big.  The hole I made to make things work takes the waist in as far as it can possibly go and I am glad it fit there at least because it wouldn't go any smaller.  These are not lined chaps, though, which I knew when ordering.  I can still feel the cold through them on a chilly morning but they definitely make it better than without.  Also, I live in a warm climate so I was looking for chaps I could wear on the warmer days as well.I used this on my dark red mustang and did half the car only. I could not tell any difference. Went back and finished the car and it looked great but it look great before using this so not sure what I was gaining.By reading all the reviews I was expecting a wow factor.Maybe it does better on older cars but my mustang is not new either but in good shape.Also used it on an 09 Focus and again, no difference.Makes me wonder with these clear coats in that these products do not get down to the paint level and sinceclear coats are already glossy, a good polish does little.Not that impressed but will give it 3 stars since most people have good luck with it but my advise is if you havea car with good paint and clear coat, do not expect miracles.I have had no problems using these and they work as described.  I do not like, though, that you have to hammer in the retaining tab to prevent the platform arms from coming out.  I also do not see how these are really double locking.  I wish they came with a adapter for the saddle since the saddle area is pretty big, but I knew that these weren't completely flat saddles (I made an adapter).  I would recommend them, but know what you are getting before you pull the trigger on getting them.
This fits perfectly onto my Scion 2006 XB. Cheap. Just did an oil and filter change. I would buy this again and reccomend this item.Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW owners
Based upon condition of your wheels, the cleaner does require some elbow scrubbing but does a descent job. Hope this helps.does the job.This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better.
Listen folks google Ethanol Damage and see what is going on these days.  Our engines are being burnt up due to the ethanol in our gas.  You have to use something to help with the drying effect of ethanol.  I use a couple things, MMO Techron and this product.  Techron is a great cleaner, but does not help lubricate the upper cylinder and this product does.  MMO is like between the two products, a decent cleaner and a decent lube.  Lucas Upper Cylinder is the "Lube" only, even though it says cleaner it is not.  The "cleaner" is a product they use in oil that cleans, but not in the sense as you know what a cleaner is.  The cleaner in MMO and Techron are flat out solvents which are very good cleaners.  This product has no solvent, and the cleaner is an additive that cleans similar to what calcium does for engine oil.  Whether or not you "feel" a difference has nothing to do with your cylinders needing this lube to protect your engine.  I actually do feel a difference sometimes in various vehicles, and also I have not felt a difference in others.  Some day your engine will be burnt out and you will have wished that you used an upper cylinder lube.  Gas has a natural oil lubrication, ethanol does not, and that is why you need to add extra lubricating oil to it.  26 bucks a gallon with free shipping is a no brainier, a gallon lasts me over a year.  I buy a small 4 ounce version from the auto parts store and use that to refill with my gallon.  The gallon gives you 32 gas tanks worth of treatment.I actually don't like Lucas's product line.  Their oil products are junk if you ask me.  But this product is the real deal, and whether or not you buy Lucas or another Upper Cylinder Lube, your engine needs these types of products to minimize the damage that ethanol is currently doing to it.  Use a cleaner like Techron once every 4 tanks and use a lube in every tank.  I've seen newer engines with 25k miles on them that look like burnt out engines that are 40 years old.  THIS IS NO JOKE, THE U.S. GOV'T IS GIVING US THE SHAFT BY FORCING US TO BURN ETHANOL IN OUR GAS.People need to understand about motor oil to make the decision on what is right for them including if Royal Purple is what they should use or not.  Forget the marketing, and anything else that suggests this or any oil will do anything "spectacular".  What it can do is what a good motor oil can do, lubricate and help protect an engine from wear (when combined with a good filter). The synthetic oils benefits occur most when an engine is subjected to the extremes, high RPM, high stress, high/low temp situations where it will remain effective better than a conventional oil. Synthetic oils may also maintain their original properties a while longer than conventional oils.  That is it however. That is very important stuff, what motor oil is for. That is good enough, all that should be expected. But it is still motor oil. Any claims of this or any other oil making your car go faster or get better MPG or anything like that should not be believed. That is not the job of motor oil.The definition of "synthetic oil" in this Country is vague and most oils labeled "fully synthetic" are not made from 100% synthetic base stocks. To find out more about how this works look up Mobil Vs Castrol, this was the lawsuit in this country that allowed oils that originated from dino oil to legally be called "fully synthetic".  This does not mean they are bad oils, just that the use of the work synthetic can be misleading.One would need to look to see what base stocks are used to see just how fully synthetic an oil truly is. The base stocks in motor oil are Group I,II,III,IV and V base stocks. Group I-III (1-3) are all conventional mineral oils that have come from the ground. Dino oil. Only Group IV and V use synthetic base stocks (P.A.O. for group IV) and (Esters for group V).95% of oils labeled "fully synthetic" actually begin with group III base stocks which are then highly processed in to the final product.This does not mean that an oil is bad because it is not a true "fully synthetic" oil using 100% group IV or V base stocks or better just because it does use them, but this is something I think is misleading and not understood by most. Though being a true group IV oil using those P.A.O. base stocks is considered better by many. It is an indication of a high quality oil, and certainly meets the definition of a true fully synthetic oil, just not the only consideration.There is much more to an oil than just the base stocks used. The formulations are very complex including many additives with detergent and anti-wear properties along with several others. Many factors go in to making a top quality motor oil.I would not suggest one think they can go incredibly long times between oil changes just because they are using a high quality oil or because a certain mileage figure is on the label. When used with a good filter one may be able to go longer between changes with a good oil, but to protect your engine better you also need to keep clean and fresh enough oil of any type in it. This oil is no exception. Your oil may be capable of outlasting your filter. Some find that changing filters more often than their oil helps extend change intervals. Also there is more to consider when determining oil change intervals than just mileage. Engine type (does it have a turbo for example), environmental extremes etc. also need to be considered. And time is a consideration too because while the oil itself may not be "worn out" or the additive package in it may still be effective (particularly in Extended Performance versions which contain larger amounts) still there are contaminants that oil filters do not remove which are a result of the combustion process, over time these build up and can only be removed by changing your oil. This is also why if you use a vehicle seasonally such as storing your motorcycle over the winter it is best to change the oil when you put it away rather than at the start of the season.If you look on the bottles of oils with claims they can go for long periods of time between oil changes (15K plus) you will find some small print saying things such as "Do not alter oil change intervals from manufacturer requirements on vehicles under warranty (as this will likely VOID your warranty not keeping the maintenance schedule)" and "25,000 miles OR ONE YEAR" as well as many other various conditional statements about the vehicle operating conditions. What may be OK under ideal and perfect conditions is different from most all real situations.Some people engage in oil testing, sending their oil to labs to find out condition of the oil.  For me this seems perhaps reasonable if one it attempting to find out what length change interval they are able to obtain with a certain oil/filter combination.  However as something done on a regular basis for the average consumer this costs as much as an oil change so I would just change the oil instead of finding out the condition the old oil is in.As to Royal Purple being a good synthetic oil? I would say yes it is. Also very expensive particularly with this deal. If it is either the best or worth the price is the larger questions to consider. Is it worth it at this price? I would say NO it was recently on sale for 6.99/quart, at that time or the next time it goes on sale that is the prime time to purchase. Personally I prefer other brands, though my decisions are changing along with the changing of formulations of the oils I use. One should do research in to various synthetic motor oils and consider those as well and decide which one to use. Do not go by marketing claims. There are independent tests and discussions, there is even one with over 1000 posts on this subject on Amazon right now. Many other outside oil forums as well. One can also have their oil tested to compare results vs other brands used at various intervals in their own vehicle if one wants to do that sort of personal research which will yield at least some results.  Also formulations are constantly changing so what ingredients used in any particular oil one year may not be what the formulation is today or will be tomorrow. If you research oil and decide that it is worth paying a bit more for a true group IV oil, then that is a reasonable decision to pay a bit more for that oil. I believe this RP is among Group IV oils, meaning it uses 100% synthetic base stocks.  But contact Royal Purple to confirm this because their formulations change like all others. Make sure you know what you are buying.I would also encourage purchasing any oil when it is on a big sale or has a rebate etc.. I believe most synthetics are overpriced and should be purchased only when on sale as this does happen on a regular basis. Check Amazon and other auto supply stores. There are constantly sales on synthetic oils and/or rebates making the cost per quart 6.00 or less on a regular basis, this is the time to purchase your oil.  Often there are packages with filters which can be good deals as long as the filter is the one you would like to use also.  This nor any other oil will perform well without also using a high quality filter, period. Make sure you are also using a high quality filter. The two need to both be of good quality for best performance and protection.I give this a 4 star rating due to price. It has been on sale for less recently and that is the time to purchase expensive oils. Plan ahead and buy your oil when on a really good sale. You can save about 50% or at least close to it often times especially when offered with packages including an oil filter (as long as it is a good filter). The star rating reflects the value of this deal at this price.In the end get a high quality oil but remember no oil is going to be providing its full benefits if it is no longer effective due to excessive use or age.  Keep your maintenance schedules up to get the best performance and longest life out of your vehicle.Royal Purple IS one in the group of top quality motor oils, just where it ranks is much more difficult to determine.  Disregard outrageous claims made by any manufacturer or person and do your own research in to various synthetic oils to make a decision on which to use.  There are several very good quality brands. Also learn about API, ILSAC and Dexos1 specifications mean. This Royal Purple DOES meet the most current API specification (SF) the ILSAC GF-5 and GM's new Dexos1 requirements. It should be compared against other synthetics that also meet those same specifications. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT RATINGS. These are your best street car motor oils. So YES this is a good oil, NO it will not do anything other high quality synthetic oils in the same class can do, and No this is not the best price I have seen for this oil.Instead of comparing claims on a bottle (other than those API, ILSAC and perhaps Dexos1 ratings) do some outside research. Ignore outrageous claims and make an informed decision based upon knowledge of the oil and filters you purchase and what an appropriate price to purchase them at is.EDIT: Note that at the time of the review Royal Purple was using PAO base stocks.  I have information that it is not not a 100% PAO oil. This has been a pattern among oils that were once 100% PAO group IV oils so you can not count on any brand maintaining their formulations or advising or a new formulation or change.  There are some advantages to a PAO oil such as no need for V.I. additives and if you believe in the value of P.A.O. base stock oils that could justify a slightly higher purchase price.  My belief in this change is a response to this question by a representative or Royal Purple.  This does not mean it is no longer a good oil to buy just that the formulation may no longer use P.A.O. base stocks.  One should know what they are paying for particularly if they are purchasing a product at a premium price especially if that product no longer uses the ingredients one things it does.Simply put, most performance car manufacturers use this oil straight from the factory and that is for good reason, it has the best makeup, and best oil analysis results of any oil that is currently on the market.  Now you could go to any forum and ask questions about oil and you are going to get 100 responses, each recommending a different oil, each with their own reason why their choice is the best.  Honestly, the best thing you can do for your engine is to run a particular oil, and do an oil analysis to see the wear and viscosity numbers.  In my engine, this oil provided the lowest number of wear metals, and the most stable number for viscosity.  Pair that up with great protection at hotter temperatures (which is something that I need for my RX8's rotary engine), and also fantastic cold flow for the winter, and you have an all-year oil that performs just as well as it protects.  Give this oil a shot, get some oil analysis done (Blackstone Labs), and see for yourself!
This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...I have used this brand/type thread sealer in many applications from intake bolts, head bolts, and even under the water line on hulls. I`ve never had any issues with removing any hardware using this product! recommend it hands down!Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes.Wheel chocks are a must for every Rver.  This is of particular importance if you use  the tri-leveler or other similar device.This is great oil - there's no debating that. Compared to normal prices in auto stores, this is a good deal as it gets the oil to your door for less than retail's 7.99 or so/quart.  That said, autozone and pep boys currently both have - and regularly have deals of 5  quarts plus a mobil 1 filter for $31...you do the math ;)
This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youIt does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletThis is a great product for auto detailing. I have personally used this product as a quick detailer, clay lube, and no-rinse wash. This is as simple as diluting the product to the proper ratio.Use this post from the ONR website to learn about the proper dilution ratios: [...]
I have two complaints about this product.  The first may be a fluke, but the something is something you should be aware of before you buy this.Issue 1) Arrived scratched, because of no protective coating.  The mirror arrived in a blister pack, which is fine, but had a lot of abrassion scratches on the front of it, which is not.  It isn't bad enough to warrant the hassle of a return, for a product this cheap, but I am certainly disappointed.  Since I only bought one, I don't know if this scratching is a trend, but I kind of suspect that it is becaus of the lack of a protective film.Issue 2) Objects in mirror are MUCH closer than they appear.  It makes things look tiny.  This may be fine if you are using this to see cars, but to see people coming from behind you in an office environmnet, it is largely ineffective.Though I usually am a big fan of buying online, from Amazon.com, this item might be better purchased in a brick and mortar store, so you can see how it will look, and ensure it isn't scratched.Although it doesn't look like the real car alarm blinking lights that I have or have seen, it is certainly better than nothing. I purchased one for my nephew along with an inexpensive motion alarm. I highly recommend that you get both for a vechicle that has no alarm. It'd probably be more realistic not to place this device in absolute plain sight. While you want the flashing to be visible, you don't want the would be theives to see that the unit is NOT built into your vehicle. My advice is to get one of these to ward off potential theives, but first you should at least get a wireless motion detector. If you can only afford one or the other, get the real alarm first. The "Wireless Motion Sensor Detector Alarm With 2 REMOTE" by MacTop for $14 + $7 shipping is pretty good. One nice thing is that it also has a red LED light that is always on, even when the alarm is not enabled. That is good for letting people know there is some type of electronic security in the vehicle. Best of luck avoiding the theives.When I received Heininger 1020 CommuteMate "Flameless Flare", I had high hopes... real flares can be dangerous, messy, and difficult to use. I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down. I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say, I was rather disappointed. The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED. In the daylight, the light output from the flare is barely noticeable. At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention. Or, if you were using it on a dark trail, it might be visible from a short distance. But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door. The light is also uni-directional (only coming from one side of the flare), so careful positioning would be a must. I think it would be tricky to use as a map light, too, since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said, I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself. It is re-usable, and it could function as a secondary warning marker. It is not flammable, and it came with batteries which seems rare these days. The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good, if most vehicles were made of steel. But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light, it might be acceptable. One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a "failsafe". After all, the more lights the better. However, the idea that it would serve as a "flare" is just not correct. If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road, for example, I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights. I would expect something MUCH brighter for an application such as that, and given that expectation this product unfortunately fell short of both its name and purpose.
I needed a chamois for my car. I got a chamois for my car. A chamois, is a chamois, is a chamois. I needed a chamois for my car. I got a chamois for my car. A chamois, is a chamois, is a chamois.Good insurance for a transmission, especially in a harsh environment, or towing situations. Cheap price to delay a costly repair job.Got this for a co worker and his car had a delay from first to second even after a trans flush,after this and some Lube Gaurd WOW! It feels like riding in a new car!!!
Love K&N wrench off filters.  My GM 5.3L V8 has a hard to reach oil filter.  On the first oil change on this truck I had to remove the nipple which attached the oil filter to the engine block in order to remove the old oil filter which became stuck to the engine block and was destroyed in an attempt to remove it.  K&N are just so simple to remove.  I only use K&N oil filters because of similar problems with other cars.This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project.
Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust.  Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid.  Will update with results.I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window. It only has about 8&#34; of contact. I will not purchase this again.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right.Installed these with the KC windsheild mounts on my 90 YJ. The harness and instructions were really easy to follow .Installed in less than 2 hours with everything tied down and hidden. My wife and I were out in the jeep looking at Christmas lights and I was on a dark road and flipped them on. WOW! These 130W daylighters definetely light up the road. They were so bright my wife asked if they were legal.Several things, you have two grounds, make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface, I used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment.If you have a narrow mounting location, you may want to consider the slim lights, these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight.The only negative thing I can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the 80's. I painted mine black and placed a vinyl KC sticker on them. Looks much better, but still ordered the KC rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them. (5 stars if they would have come with a rock guard cover, instead of the solid yellow smiley faces.)These hooks are really thin/skinny.  I had no problem hanging them to the headrest posts (2012 Toyota Tacoma).  However, they do not hang straight down.  I had to bend them so they would hang down instead of sticking out @ ~120 degrees.  The ride in my truck is pretty bumpy and anything hung on these do get tossed around a bit.
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.Use these in trailer tires, car tires, truck tires, ANY tires-these have saved me several times on the road, pull the nail, install one or 2 of these, reinflate with a small portable (or my nitrogen tank if I'm in the service truck), back on the road.These are almost identical to the ones I've rented from Autozone in the past.  I decided to get my own set for sheer convenience.  The work well for the passenger cars--don't know about any other type of coil springs.  Can be tricky on progressive springs with lots of coils on the ends. because you need to have room in between coils for these to fit.  Also, it should be obvious but these are to be applied on coils only.  Attaching one end to the strut mounts or top cap is a recipe for disaster.
I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror.Have had these for almost a year on my '13 JK Wrangler. They do a great job in keeping the door frames from getting scratched up and ruined. The glue strips are easily used on the back, by pulling off the protective paper coating, just place them onto the door jam, and hold in place for a moment. They stick in place even without the doors being on the Jeep for most of the year!Since your support jacks in the corners of the trailers are not recommended for leveling your camper these are a must. I haven't used these yet but seem well able to level out those less than level camp sites. Put it behind the trailer wheels on the low side and back onto it. Check level and adjust as needed. Level? Lower your support jacks.
Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money.Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car!I bought these at a well known camping store.  They work pretty good.  The plastic pins are not fastened in though, so I put a dab of superglue on each side of the pin (at the edge of the fabric) and now the pins are securely in place.I also was not a big fan of the hooks... so I used some small binder clips.  If you squeeze the metal tab on the binder clip you can pop it out of the clip - then feed it through the grommet and put the tab back into the clip.  Now you have a secure clip to hold your lights!This requires you to slide the tabs off the awning before rolling it back up.I downgraded this to 4 stars since they didn't have the plastic pins fixed into place.This is a much better way to hang lights than using clothespins to attach them to the flap of the awning.  We had some storms when we were camping and not a single string of lights came off.  (I had tie-downs on the awning)So buy these, get some binder clips, and get a tube of superglue and you will be all set.
Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.Because of the chemicals used, the old fashioned pyrotechnic flares are hard to find.  You might find a 3 pack at the local auto store or order a 50 pack box from the distributor via truck shipment, but few mail order houses want to deal with the shipping requirements for the flammable goods and oxidizers.Enter the LED flare.  This product has one bright LED that when the button is pressed once, it flashes.  It's bright in one direction, but not nearly as bright as a burning flare.  The magnet is quite powerful - I figured it would be little more than a refrigerator magnet but it grabbed onto my car quite well.As a map light, it's not really usable since maps have colors used and this is monochromatic light.  Also the directional led and lens in front of it form a 1/2" x 3" strip of red light on paper with the second press of the light button.  The 3rd press turns it off.To ensure it's ready to use, I'd recommend storing the batteries externally.  Also remember to gain anyone's attention you'll need to aim it into their eyes.With just one red LED it's not that bright - I've seen much better 12V LED arrays on amazon that are placed into a reflector and spread left, straight on, and right for a much brighter, and wider beam.Because of the dim output, and lack of usability as a map light, plus trying to replace a 15 minute pyrotechnic flare that you can not look at due to the brightness with one red led I am giving the product just 3 stars.  It's pushing a 2 star product.
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.I have a 2001 Silverado with a 5.3 engine. On the 2001, 5.3 engine the Knock sensors sit in deep pockets. Water tends to get down in there sooner or later and that causes the knock sensors to fail. Replace the harness while you are at, as the harness is the seal.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.
I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.These are almost identical to the ones I've rented from Autozone in the past.  I decided to get my own set for sheer convenience.  The work well for the passenger cars--don't know about any other type of coil springs.  Can be tricky on progressive springs with lots of coils on the ends. because you need to have room in between coils for these to fit.  Also, it should be obvious but these are to be applied on coils only.  Attaching one end to the strut mounts or top cap is a recipe for disaster.
These are well-priced, heavy stabilizing jacks.  We bought them so we would have four stabilizers on our Casita trailer instead of just the two that came on the trailer.ZERO complaints.  The jacks are heavy, easy to use and do the job.One thing - they are marketed by amazon along with some "jack pads" to place underneath them on the ground.  The tripod base of this particular jack does NOT fit on the plastic jack pads.I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust.strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.

Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.
This is a water additive that can potentially increase your cooling capacity by a few degrees by lowering surface tension and increasing boiling point.Headline says it all.  I use it to pump up a water well pressure tank from a 12 v battery using a small portable air compressor.Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.
bought this for my CRV originally. now still works with my Honda Pilot. has lasted 5+ years and still going strong. holds the front weight of the car easily. just line it up right and drive slowly up the ramp. it can take a beating and is very hard plastic.i can change my own oil now easily and for dirt cheap yet high quality.extremely satisfied. would highly recommend. (if you are tight on a budget just park half on a curb and it should give enough space underneath, but this lets you do it in your own garage in a much nicer fashion)ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO HAVE WHEN CHANGING OIL:- a couple jack stands (i always use this as a backup as never good to have a car fall on you)- 4 tire chocks to prevent rear tires from moving by accident (always use parking brake as well)- socket wrench (walmart extendable one is solid)- oil and oil filter- gloves and lots of newspaper to prevent oil messes (definitely will be some)- oil pan (walmart has a solid large one. the bigger the better. should have built in spout)- about 1 hr of time... drive it around a bit first to warm up oil so it flows faster, careful as it will be hot)- channellock tongue and groove plier in case you need help to remove the oil filter (it is crazy tight initially but doesn't have to be)There are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare. It will last much longer, and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car.  The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining. It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it isn't anywhere near as bright as a flare. It has a single LED that is very directional. If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P. Logue, 2010This reminds me of cheap Harbor Freight stocked items.It would work in a pinch to top off the air pressure of a small, compact car...It is not able to air up a full size tire from empty.  It will air up a spare.It is user-unfriendly to uncoil the cigarette lighter plug.The light is useful in a pinch, but awfully cumbersome to access (it has to be plugged in).  Since there are no batteries, so it has to remain plugged into the car cigarette lighter to work.  It was mediocre in brightness.The hazard / red light has to be plugged in, too, so it isn't really feasible to use as a light to warn other traffic.This would be much better as far as the light aspect if it had a battery.It is noisy and dances on the ground as it is working.  (Kind of like a dancing jumping bean.)You can get better, I'm sure...keep shopping...
This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.
Battery Tenders are a requirement if you want a recreational vehicle/ collector car / motorcycle battery to last through winter storage. I have used these for several years and can attest to their value.I would recommend this product for maintaining battery health.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery.

I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump.
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet
The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.Independent testing results revealed that this was the best value oil filter on the market.  Well made on the inside.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.First of all, the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car's motor. Secondly, the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable.
I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.This is great for motorcycle batteries. If you are charging a car battery, I'd look for one of the more powerful battery tenders. This is great for any motorcycle, atv, jet ski, etc that sits outside, as the unit is waterproof. I have been using this charger for over 3 years and it has never failed me.
This is a must-have if you have a wall charger as the length is great and if your battery is not close to the charger. I use mine for charging my RV truck battery and the house side battery at the same time, as I have a Battery Tender 'Y' for charging more than 1 battery. This is heavy-duty and works for both my Battery Tender plus and my Battery MINDer's; at a great price. I highly recommend this, and the Y for 2 or more batteries, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many).

I have a Yuasa lead acid wet cell battery in my bike, this looks to be a good match for it. The included hook up wiring is good quality, and the unit has a simple to read interface: power on, charging, maintenance mode/trickle charge.Glad that we can purchase a good quality charger for so little money...my BT cost $60.One tip: match the charger to the battery type. Lead acid, AGM, gel, lithium ion, lithium iron phosphate batteries all need specific chargers.
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though.
I had to recently buy a second one of these, after somehow losing the original one I had. Just to give you an idea of how solidly built these are, I bought my first and original one 6 years ago and never had to change the battery a single time. Outside of carrying a set of jumper cables in your car, carrying a quality tire pressure gauge is priceless.OK, I purchased this for my bike, because I had a good experience with another accutire pressure gauge.But this one &#34;sucks&#34;. It worked ok when I first got it, but after 2 years the battery went dead and I only used it maybe 20 times. My other accutire pressure gauge is 10 years old and I'm still on the original battery. So I purchased a new battery and found out you have to take this whole thing apart, to get to where the battery is buried. So I take it apart very carefully, not to lose these very small parts and replaced the battery. So happy with my battery install, I go out to my garage and try it out and all I get is 1 psi on the lcd, so I try a different car, same thing 1 psi. This is a disposable item, when the battery dies you just throw it away and buy a new one. No thanks, I will keep using my analog pressure gauge.I recently rec'd this unit, charged for a full 20hrs.Just used it to jump start my 2005 G35 coupe, it worked perfectly as I used it twice, checked the status light, appeared to be be able to jump a few more V6 engines before I need to recharge unit.Also, my battery was totally dead, I mean when I turned the key...no lights on the dash, no clicking sounds from the engine...totally drained battery.I might consider buying another unit for my other carEdit: March 26 2013I tried to help my friend who had a 2008 Subaru Legacy 4 cylinder turbo, it failed to start it as he drained his battery when he forgot to turn off the interior map light. I was surprised it failed since it started my V6 G35 which also had a near dead battery. I hope my unit was not good for just one jump??Also, note that I recharge my jump starter after every single use.Reducing rating from 5 STARS to just 3 stars
Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same carThe tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have.

That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?I purchased a Groupon voucher for a $10 oil change. I figured the oil itself cost more than $10.I went to the local car care center (Nuno's Auto Care)with my voucher in hand. I was told, for your car there will be an extra $12 charge for the special oil filter. I told them "no way", and walked out.I went home and logged onto Amazon and found this genuine GM AC Delco filter and a spare plastic cap for less than $10. If the quality is good enough for a brand new car, it's good enough for my 3 year old Malibu. It fits perfectly. Yes, I also had to buy 5 quarts of oil, but I prefer to hand my money to a trustworthy retailer than pay a premium price for a non premium filter at a service center with questionable business practices.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!This is a factory replacement for a Honda Rincon. Easy to fill and charge, works great. Sealed battery and should last quite some time in conjunction with my Battery Tender Jr.
I bought this item for the battery tender .  Hook it up to the battery terminals and plug it in the battery tender.This is great for motorcycle batteries. If you are charging a car battery, I'd look for one of the more powerful battery tenders. This is great for any motorcycle, atv, jet ski, etc that sits outside, as the unit is waterproof. I have been using this charger for over 3 years and it has never failed me.I have 3 cars and a boat. The boat has 3 batteries. This will accommodate regular car batteries to house batteries for the boat.
I gave this 5 stars because it is what it is and it's what is sold all around in RV repair/sales shops...personally, I don't think it's so heavy duty, but it's the best one on the market. I've checked out many of them in my travels at RV stores and they cost much more than what I paid for this one. It works, it does mark easily so be careful about rubbing the hitch crank on it, but it is a good buy here on Amazon.com.Appears to be honda civic compatible. But after using Lubegard I have found a stark difference (better) with Lubegard. Lucas works but it slows down shifts (about a 2 seconds delay) and I had to gun the engine to get that power transfer up a hill or long shallow incline. Lubegard transfers power to the civic very quickly. I suspect that the reason is because lubegard is very thin and Lucas is too thick and tacky. Maybe it will work for you in a much more positive way, but not for me. I am surprised that other reviewers are saying that it makes shifting BETTER ???I will assume they never compared it to lubegard, so they would have known what smooth really is, like i did. OR perhaps it really shifts better based on the particular car make and degree of tranny damage; so in all fairness, I cannot knock those reviewers, but you can try lubegard. I stand by it; if you want smoother shifting (does not stop leaks if you have any !Conclusion: I deleted my initial review, in favor of lubegard. Lubegard is clearly a better product (but not all their other products are superior though). Lucas works so-so. I took off two stars after I found another product that works better. No, I do not work for them OR sell their products - I just love to tell people about great discoveries.So after reading the great reviews here I bought this item at Wal-Mart and took it home to charge my deep cycle marine batteries.Worked fine for about an hour, then I noticed that it seemed to be stalled at 85% charge.  I did some more internet reading and discovered that this is a common problem with this unit, the readout stalls at a given percentage and never changes unless you unhook it and rehook it to the battery.  I did that and instantly the readout changed to 100%.So now I know for a fact I can never trust my brand new charger to tell me when it's done charging.And worse, despite being 100% charged the unit never switched over to trickle charge.  So despite being billed as a "smart" charger it's just a normal full power charger that will boil your battery dry if you leave it hooked up too long.  Why spend $45 on something that a $10 charger will do?Not only is it junk, the packaging is a complete lie as well.  Now I know and you can bet your sweet cajones I'll never buy a Schumacher anything again.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.
Bought this for my Honda vehicle as a replacement for the OEM Honda cabin filter.  Compared the number of pleats, same.  Fits the frame just the same.  Lower cost than an OEM filter.  Highly recommended.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Battery Tenders are a requirement if you want a recreational vehicle/ collector car / motorcycle battery to last through winter storage. I have used these for several years and can attest to their value.I would recommend this product for maintaining battery health.
Bought this to use with an air compressor. I didn't want to risk shorting out a fuse using the compressor in the cigarette lighter in the car.I bought this version over the plastic version because you can connect any type of air compressor to it. The adapter is the same kind as used in car and bicycle tires.I used it last weekend to clear the water lines of my travel trailer and it worked as advertized.I initially was going to just use a bicycle pump to push the water out, but I managed to borrow an air compressor at the last minute. I blew the lines for about 30 minutes and then pumped in some RV antifreeze as recommended by my trailer manufacturer.Even though you'll only use this adapter once a year, I would recommend this over the plastic version because it should last a lifetime.I wanted to use this to fill transmission oil into the transmission after performing a filter change and dropping the transmission pan. It broke not even after putting 2 quarts in the pan.. Needless to say that I was not happy as I had to WALK to the next car store to buy a replacement since I coudl not drive with only 2 quarts in the tranny. Buy 2 or 3 to be on the safe side if one fails or use a different solution to begin with. I am using a funnel from now on in combination with a longer plastic tube going down from over the engine.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well, no issues. Would purchase again.
The Multi-Tow Adapter is needed to supply multiple trailer use.bought this to charge / maintain spare batteries not in my truck, worked perfectly.great product,would buy again.good service.fits battery tender.This is a very useful item that I carry with me whenever I use our small travel trailer.  Easy to place and adjust to.
I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A.

Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.Bought this in May 2012.I usually carry jumper cables in my car, but not anymore. Jumper cables: you should get a set longer than your vehicle, so you don't have to back it out of a parking spot first. Then with the longer cables, you should get the heaviest gauge wire you can or you lose power through the cables. Then of course you'll need someone with a car or truck to help you!!Solution: Booster PacI really like this battery pack compared to others.1) no unnecessary gadgets like a flashlight, air compressor or 110V AC inverter. While these are handy to have they usually are of poor quality when combined in a package like this.2) Size is great and easier to carry. While all these jumper battery packs are heavy, this one is relatively narrow in width making it easier to carry at your side with arm extended.3) Takes up little room in your trunk and can be locked up with a bicycle cable lock.4) Can be charged by your auto's 12V adapter. You have to monitor the battery's green "Charge complete" LED  because there is no automatic shutoff when the charged through the 12V outlet. This means you can overcharge it and reduce it's life and capacity.5) Use it as a power source to recharge your phone or iPad etc.Maintenance notes:Be careful using this as a power supply. The BATTERY is designed to deliver peak power to start your car. It is not designed to deliver continuous power like a car battery or battery back up.For longest battery life recharge as soon as possible after each use and at least once a month.Avoid discharging it to 50% or less as this will eventually decrease power output. Recharge as soon as possible after each use to extend it's useful lifeCons:Only 1: I don't like the AC charger. The brick gets hot and stays hot even when the charge is complete. Must be an old style transformer electric vampire.CHARGING OPTION:I recently bought a modern battery charger/maintainer for the car to top off my car battery and maintain the charge when the car sits. These chargers are not expensive for the lower current models.(about $20 on up)Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerModern chargers are designed to gently charge your battery especially from 80% to full. This charge method will extend the life of your battery and give you maximum amps when you need it. When your battery is full, they go into a Float/monitor mode.I used my new battery charger on this Booster Pac and had great results. I tested the battery Pac with a professional 100Amp battery and alternator tester. The Booster Pac tested  well within the good range which was better than charge with the supplied AC adapter.NOTE: you can use a motorcycle/car battery charger through the Booster Pac jump cables or 12V accessory plug. Both work.Fortunately I have not needed to jump a car since I bought this unit in May 2012.Would definitely buy this again.Took off 1 star for the AC charger that gets hot during and stays hot after the battery is charged. It is a potential fire hazard and wastes energy.
This is a good quality compressor to keep in the trunk for use when on the road. Better than any of the light, jump starter , compressor that have ownedThis is a great product.  My use for it is in my travel trailer (TT) which I have a solar charging system in.  Rather than buy an expensive battery monitor, I just use this unit to get an idea of the state of the system.  I can tell by the voltage the approximate state of my batteries and in the daylight I can tell if the solar is in bulk, absorption, or float.  And it is backlit all the time so I can see it in the dark, too.What a deal, it's huge, has a screen that snaps in and it's the right size for putting gasoline in things.  In this day and age where most gas can spouts don't have screens, this is an excellent item to have and a great price.
good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.As high beams are on only when its really dark I liked the increased field of vision how it increased the sides and the length of what I can see.  Yes I would buy them again.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches
The jug came with a seal which is intact.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt the quality of a product that is in a sealed container and that is labeled as it was marketed.Although it should be included for free with the Jack this item is a must have and reasonably priced.  Careful it's also easily stolen.it is just an oil filter, out with the old in with the new one, as long as it fits it is done
It is thinner than the stock air cleaner.  I put this in at the same time as I added a Dynomax cat-back exhaust system.  The truck can stay in 4 cylinder mode longer now, theoretically boosting my mileage a bit.  Having used K&N replacement filters for years, this one did not disappoint.Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck.  I like this one.  Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality.I ordered this replacement bolt/washer combo for when I changed the oil on a 93 toyota pickup that had been sitting up for a long time.  This combo was a direct replacement and looks like good quality.
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RV
I bought this item for the battery tender .  Hook it up to the battery terminals and plug it in the battery tender.Using this to keep the battery charged on the portable generator. Very easy to hook up and worked well to charge the battery and to keep it charged. Also used this to charge a battery on a rideable toy train for my neighbor.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price
This is a must-have if you have a wall charger as the length is great and if your battery is not close to the charger. I use mine for charging my RV truck battery and the house side battery at the same time, as I have a Battery Tender 'Y' for charging more than 1 battery. This is heavy-duty and works for both my Battery Tender plus and my Battery MINDer's; at a great price. I highly recommend this, and the Y for 2 or more batteries, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.I did a bit of research before purchasing this product. If you want a quick charge, I have read that your battery won't last as long. For battery life, the ideal charge is low amerage.  I appreciate that this charger provides a low amp charge to the battery. I had an older battery charger that I believe prematurely destroyed one of my 12v batteries, so I did my best to find the best value replacement. As a matter of fact, the way I saw the older charger behaving (according to my digital multimeter), I was concerned that it could cause the battery to explode or start a fire. I decided to get a new one. I looked at all of the battery chargers I could find on Amazon and other sites. Eventually, I settled on this particular model for these reasons:1. Provides a low amperage charge, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.2. Desulphination mode, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.3. Safety shutoff features, so that it doesn't overcharge the battery.4. Reads the battery polarity and illuminates a red light if you have it reversed.5. Excellent review on Amazon and other sites that sell battery chargers.I've only been using the battery minder for a couple of months, but I think it is working well. The recharges and maintenance modes seem appropriate. The batteries seem to last a long time after I charge them. This product seems to be living up to the claims and ratings. I am impressed.I admittedly didn't see the sound byte of the horn until now, and if I had heard it earlier, I would have thought differently. I installed this to have a lower, and hopefully louder tone in my horn. The factory horn was lower though. I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now, so on an Isuzu Trooper, it is a little pathetic. I blame this on myself though, and I realize the product is good for its intended audience. Just don't buy this if you havea  truck! The look of this horn, if you have it visible, is a plus, and the shipping and installation were a breeze.
This is a great little charger, especially for the price.  Simple hookup with the ring terminals on my motorcycle and the connector stays zip-tied to the subframe just below the seat.  Once connected the LED on the charger gives me status information at a glance so I can always tell when the battery is charging or sitting there maintaining a full charge.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.As the builder of a chopper motorcycles (with hefty 113ci S&S; and air rides with built in air compressors) I need to know exactly how much draw is done during a bike's start up. Especially since the compression tappets are vacuum controlled, the ride's suspension is computer aided and there's extensive LED lighting on the vehicle which kicks in on a button press.Using the the Solar BA7 I was able to diagnose exactly what goes on during the bike's fire up and adjust (and lessen!) the start up procedure accordingly. I made changes to the boot up of the bike including the 120+ LED lights based on the huge draw required to start it.Without the BA7 my only indicator of too much draw was a dimming headlight!If you're into any sort of vehicle construction or anything that uses 12V batteries you'll need accurate and informative feedback on what's going on with the battery status.The Solar BA7 seems to report consistently and it works. Worth every penny.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
First of all, the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second, once the car is started, you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display, indicating that a charge is occurring. However, this is a static icon, it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom. And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery. For this you need accurate readings, and I can not see these on this unit.I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line.A car we store for the winter in an un-heated garagehas the battery go dead with-in a month .And a couple of times the parasitic drain ruined a cell/battery.So we bought a Battery Tender for that issue.One doesn't need to be versed about an automobileor a BT to use one and solve a variety of problems.It's a worry free ~ wonderful product that completely monitors itself.You can leave it hooked up for weeks or months etc.All though you ought to check on it every once in a while.The cab light in our truck was left on overnight & wouldn't startthe BT restored it enough with-in two hours to turn the motor over.A battery must have at least 3 volts left or the BT won't initiate chargingThen your down to jumping it, if the battery isn't yet ruined.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord (box to outlet) 6 ft 2"longCable that clips to a battery (with clips attached - box to battery) 7 ftGiving a possible continual length of over 13 ft.If that's not long enough, the 25 ft BT extension is economicaland our experience is that the BT is just as effective weather the ex is used or not.Footnote: A warning in the instructions say ~ quote1. "If the positive battery post is connected to the vehicle chassis,then the vehicle has a positive ground system.2. If the negative battery post is connected to the vehicle chassisthen the vehicle has a negative ground system.(Most systems are negative)3. For negative ground systems connect the positive alligator clip to the positive battery post.4. Then connect the negative alligator clip to the vehicle chassis."Then it goes on to state several areas NOT to connect to.This language has always worried me what exactly was the right thing to do here.So I phoned Deltran Corp and asked.They said they have to state that to protect themselves butthat it's fine to hook both clips to the two appropriate terminals of the battery.I must say here that the folks at Deltran are very accessible ~ knowledgeable ~and offered comparison information between the BT Jr verses the BT plus ~ cheerfully.I was impressed with their customer service.
At a glance lets you see the state of your battery even from a distance where you can't read it.  The LED's are handy in addition to the actual voltage readout.  The voltage is accurate.  I use two of them routinely and they're very handy.  I did buy a second one after I found the first one very good.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:"18 gauge wire""15 Amp Capacity"Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield.
Bought this to use on my 08 4Runner. Converts the factory socket into a 4 prong flat connector to use with most common uHaul trailer wiring. Works great, seems well made. Only gripe is that it doesn't seem to fit with a reassuring snap or click or anything of that sort. You push it in and have to sort of guess if you got it right.I haven't used this product much, but I do want to warn people that there is an indentation in the bottom (up front) for this chock to fit on one of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler).  This is good because if the tire is sitting on one of the levelers that this chock is integrated in, the chock won't move.  I suppose that you could still use this chock without one of their levelers, but it won't sit flat on the ground due to that indentation mentioned above.  If your RV doesn't need a leveler, then using this chock may not work as designed.  You may want to consider one of the chocks that doesn't require a leveler to use (Camco 44492 RV Super Wheel Chock).  I'll update this post when I get more experience with them (it comes in a set of two chocks).I purchased two of these 20' ft heavy duty tow straps to leave in the back of my 2007 tahoe.  I have pulled multiple cars out of ditches with these straps. They are a life saver and not expensive.  I would have paid double for these.  These are a great emergency item to leave in the trunk of your car.  You never know when you will need them.
I use this to connect my wind turbine to my battery bank.It works well,hasn't cracked,and the connectors are solid.It will last me for years to come.Battery Tenders are a requirement if you want a recreational vehicle/ collector car / motorcycle battery to last through winter storage. I have used these for several years and can attest to their value.I would recommend this product for maintaining battery health.for some reason it listed for my application,but it was for a newer vehicle so it did not work for me ,i gave it to my aunty and it worked perfectly.
I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different.I use this battery tender for my Harley Davidson. With the OEM security system, the Harley can drain a battery quickly, making it a hard start on those cool fall mornings. When we are up north at our lake home, the HD does not have a garage to be placed in, so I will use this  battery tender outside and did not trust using the normal battery tender out side with not protection, so I was using a pail to place over the tender. Now I can use this one without worry.Would purchase again.I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses.
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely
Great tool for measuring your tires, makes it easier to determine if you have uneven wear!  Would recommend this for anyone with a trailer.I put one of these in each car for emergencies.  This is a great addition to your emergency kit (you know, the one with jumper cables, ponchos, flashlights, etc. that you should keep in your car).I highly reccomend this with the Meguiar's DA polisher,  perfect to use with Meguiars Ultimate Polish! But make sure you remove any contaminants from your paint beforehand!
I used some to polish my kitchen sink.  I think the sink is made of galvanized metal and I am not sure if this works on that, because it didn't make it shine anymore than it was.  But on the faucets and sprayer, this thing made it like a mirror shine.  It was amazing.  Definately give this stuff a try, just be sure to test it first.  Read the directions carefully.I put this wrap around step rung on the entrance step to my RV.  It's easy to install and is ok, for what it is.  The downsides are:  it is smaller than the step, the springs to hold it in place are weak and surely are not going to last long under heavy use.  It's still on my RV step, so I can't say it isn't useful.  But I ordered a much better one.I bought this stove top cover to use in my RV to give me more work space, since I rarely use the stove itself.  It fits perfectly and does exactly what I want it to do.  And it is sturdy.
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery.

I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.
It does what it is supposed to and suds up.Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.
I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Installed this in my 95 Civic Hatchback.  It is brighter than any bulbs I have ever put in the civic and I have own the car many years.  All the Civic forums suggested that this is the brightest bulb you can get for you EG civic (other than HID).  Supposedly, it only has a 200 hour life.  Even if I average an hour per day, that is still at least 6 months.  I'm okay with that.
I purchased this Battery Tender Plus in July of 2011, it's now March 2014 and it still works flawlessly.I use it in the winter to keep my motorcycle battery topped off.Not much else to say except that this was a wise investment. Trickle charging with this is the best way to maintain the longevity of your battery.Would recommend to anyone parking a car, truck, or motor home for more than 3-4 weeks. Or anyone parking a motorcycle for over 2-3 weeks.I have to be honest, I was a little scared when I heard that I have to put the acid in myself. However, when I got the battery the instructions were clear. Make sure to put the battery on a trickle charger for a few hours as it does not come charged. This battery replaced a 1 year old battery the previous owner installed. Hopefully this battery will last longer than that. No problems so far, after 2 months of running it in my SV650I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.
Of all the battery chargers on the market, the Battery Tender is the best.  The device is small and portable, works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge (over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery).  It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use.  The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc. or not.  Highly recommended. I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.Bad design...  The two doors that cover the  hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered, can easily be misplaced. Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit.  LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it.  I will keep it as long as the pump works.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.

This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.
Do not purchase other brand recharger kits.  They are inferior oils used with them.  This kit is by far better than any other recharger kits out there.Precise sizes since they weren't listed in any description: .045 .080 .050 .040 .060 .044I used to gap 4 NGK Iridium IX spark plugs. The tool's metal didn't bend. Would buy again.Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size.
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.
These should come factory standard.  They look awesome installed, they give you some traction when stepping on the doors lower frame, and they keep you from uglying up the paint.  Couldnt be easier to put on, just rag off any mud/dust/ect from the area, use the supplied alcohol wipes to take off any oils and such from touching the area and line the piece up, pull the strip off the double stick, and press down along its length, easy peasy.Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push down
These are some heavy duty spring compressors.  I work on all my cars and toys, and these things will more than do the job and should last forever.just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didII have had these on my 2003 Tahoe for over 1yr & they work great.will put them on my 1986 cutlass when they need to be changed.
these clips worked great. I removed the old door catches and replaced with these ones and they look and work just like  factory clips .I just used these pads for under my stabilizer jacks (see picture).  They work as described for my RV trailer.  Sturdy, hard plastic with a flat side and an indented, grid on the other side.  The velcro strap holds them together nice and neat.  I'm not sure these would work for motorhome jacks, however.  They work great for me.These party light holders do the job but the eyelets will rust and leave a stain on your awning tube. I like the rubber holders better.
Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.

As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.
These are great blades made by Anco.  They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.  They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.  They are easy to install and work great.  I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.  5 stars.these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these coversThese are the best wiper blades I have used -- much better than other Rain-X blades. My only complaint is they are ugly. The connector is bulky and the arms are all plastic, making them look cheap. I would give these an extra star if they were lower profile. That being said, I would definitely recommend them.
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE.THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT.BOUGTH THESE WITH THE THOUGHT OF REPLACING CLEANING CLOTHS OR RAGS AS THEY ARE BETTER KNOWNTHESE ACTUALLY DO THE JOB AND THE PRICE IS GREAT
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation
The good:  It adds significant security to a trailer.  The lock for the coupler latch can fit the wider models.  The lock that fits in the tongue where the hitch ball goes is easy to get on and off.Why it doesn't get five stars:1:  The lock for the coupler latch, even when lubricated and the cover on was a PITA to get the key inserted and wiggled in after the trailer was in one place for a couple months.  I was fearing that the key would break.2:  The tongue lock, it was hard to tell where to pull out the key.Would I buy this again?  Yes.  However, the lock for the coupler latch, I would throw away, and instead, I would consider using a long shackle padlock, or a lock that has an automotive-grade cylinder.  In all cases, I'd use some Tri-Flow or another locksmith-grade lubricant in all locks (NOT WD-40!)I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag.
I bought this wrench to remove the oil filters on my arctic cat quads.  I can never get them off and have resorted to punching holes in them with a screwdriver and then turning the screwdriver to remove the filter.  This wrench worked like a charm and I no longer have to tear  up the oil filter to remove it.No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.The last time I drained my gray water tank on my trailer, I sort of cross threaded the cap and busted off on the the tabs, making the cap unusable.This is a great replacement and I like the fact that I can attach a hose to the cap to drain my gray water tank into a container, or if I am boondocking/dry camping, I can just run the hose away from my trailer to drain the sink water!
It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!Well , I would Buy it again !  It Does what it is designed to do , rather Well and is easy to adjust and or Remove.Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.
I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.These are fairly solid lead cables. The cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair, where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead, each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap USB cable.The banana clips are normal/common, the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part, i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard, these are solid. Additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable, i think it will hold up very well and not break lose.The alligator clip ends seem to be just fine. contrary to others results i have 2 pairs and the alligator ends are just fine, teeth all line up fine. the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close. clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersOverall:Really wish they were combined leads not 2 separate wires and thicker gaugeGood cables, and i would still recommend them** If this review helped you please click the button below **First of all, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A MOUNTING BRACKET! For the first time ever, I didn't read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which Amazon lists as "frequently purchased together". On the flip side though, I doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy. The bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the 7 pin plug in otherwise.The adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion shouldn't be an issue. Both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well. The wires are heavy (enough) gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus, though I always recommend soldering them.My only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it. Everything needed to mount it is included but it's very soft steel and strips with little effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle.
It is a cheap steel receiver tow hook.  Nothing more.A retainer clip to keep the strap in the hook should have been included at the very least.  Otherwise any slack might make your tow strap pop out, or worse yet, stab your strap over the end of the hook and rip it.I have done a lot of pulling, vehicle recovery, and off-road driving.  I've seen every scary, unimaginable tow method.  And, I've seen people use things that were not designed for pulling like cables and chains.  Misuse of these items can seriously injure and kill people, as well as do major damage to vehicles.  Because, when you put thousands of pounds of stress on a tow line and suddenly it breaks or lets loose, it shoots straight back in the opposite direction and will go RIGHT THROUGH windshields, radiators, plastic, sheet metal, and BYSTANDERS.If you want something to keep in your trunk in case you ever get stuck in a ditch, or if you even THINK you're an off-roader gearing up for the trail, DON'T BUY THIS.Frame mounted clevis points are the safest bet.  But, if you don't have that luxury at least buy a receiver CLEVIS mount with a closed eye and a screw-pin clevis.Other safety advice from experts:Only use a soft nylon tow strap rated at least twice your vehicle's weight.Never use a strap with built-in hooks or metal eyelets.Never use chain.Never use wire rope cable.I knew the dangers when I bought it.  But I'm not using it for towing or emergency recovery.  And I know how to and not to use it.I'm obliged to switch regularly between 1-7/8" and 2" balls on my hitch, and the Reese Interlock hitch balls make the swap a one-handed operation with the Reese Towpower hitch. That may not seem significant, but in inclement weather it allows you to hold an umbrella or tarp for protection and complete the swap with your remaining hand, in comparative comfort; the first time you have to change a ball in the rain, sleet or snow will sell you on one-handed swaps.I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket.
Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle.I found a Ford 6.0L diesel priced so low I couldn't pass, and, I knew beforehand it'd require certain upgrades to instill natural diesel longevity and I needed a tool to help - enter Scangauge II.Scangauge II has features beyond a simple scan tool, eg Trip Computer (Miles per Gallon; Tank-to-Empty; Cost per Trip), Horsepower, -Mile Time, 0-60mph WOTs, Stopping Distance and others...Neat features but not reason I purchased...Digital Gauges (reason): the Mfr refers to this feature as "X-Gauge"- Screen displays four real-time On-board diagnostics Parameter Identifications (OBDII PIDs) of user choosing- PIDs displayed can be changed via pressing adjacent buttons- Performance Data (MPG, Qtr Mile Time etc) may be displayed together/alongside PIDs- Displays vehicle mfr generic PIDs automatically (gasoline engine)- Displays diesel mfr PIDs (ie EOT, ICT, IPR etc) after user creates an 'x-gauge' by input data from Scangauge websiteWith basic knowledge and study I use this gadget to my advantage, I mean either repair vehicle myself, or, know what's wrong (exactly what's broken) beforehand, to preclude somename repair shop ripping me off - it's way too common.I think it comes ready to troubleshoot gasoline engines, in general, yet I'd to enter math data (avail on website) manually for it to sense and display PIDs unique to diesel.After several days of study/application, my opinion is this tool will help diagnose with near certainty, components which have failed and components in early stage of failure.  Its ability to depict four PIDs simultaneously in real-time allows comparison between what related PIDs reflect per desired and actual.Also note I found most big name Tuners boasting scan ability do not monitor/depict many key PIDs as Scangauge, a huge shortcoming for tuner price.Simply put, the Scangauge II is much more than an OBDII code reader and, it'll be difficult/near impossible to find an item offering same diagnostic capabilities for both gas and diesel engines at price.Update Jan 2014: I've purchased another for my Boy's pickup with a 7.3L.  We both have SCT Livewire 9600 Tuners but due to Livewire 9600's monitoring limitations we have Scangauges connected full time to monitor key PIDs.KyleThe installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit. Routing the cable is really up to the operator. I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car. I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel. It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network. The "fastest" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT's Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers. If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down. According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood. I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio. Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is "slipping". Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip. You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer). It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed. The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy. The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises. I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive. I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact. The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations). I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car. A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro. The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car. There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the "realtime" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices. If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently. The gauge readouts began to "flicker" between PIDs. For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR. Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving. It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network. When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage. My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles. Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car. The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed "trip computers" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderbought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck

Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Best price on the internet&#8230;.worked great on gear oil replacement for my F-150 2001 axle.  Last time it will need to be replacedI bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.
Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for.
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!I used this item for filling the transmission on my 2008 WRX and on my Fiancee's 2007 cobalt.  People that say the hose is to short go to lowes or home depot and get a longer one.These look striking similar to the Bosch Clear advantage wipers, springy curved blade that hugs your windows. I did have a bit of trouble getting them on, for my car I had to take off the pre installed adapter on the Anco Contour wiper but after that it fits well and does a good job at clearing the window. Time will tell on their longevity.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckwork great for my John Deere X500Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
The ANCO Contour is a decent curved blade providing an effective sweep. The "UB" part is the one that works with the flat cane-shaped connector, as opposed to the "OE" blades that comes with three adapter clips which appear to fit rectangular original equipment brackets on some vehicles. The compatibility list has been updated more accurately, but it is best to check before placing your order.Though not the most aesthetically handsome clip to look at, the "Kwik Connect" contour blade is easy to install and costs about as much as any other full blade assembly. I like it.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.This is not the exact same cable that comes with the ScanGauge from LinearLogic, but it does the job. I would buy it again.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckNo headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius.

No issues, just as described.  Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger.  Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone.I use this to connect my wind turbine to my battery bank.It works well,hasn't cracked,and the connectors are solid.It will last me for years to come.No, I wouldn't use this to power a generator from 12' from my vehicle so my kids could play XBox...but it works perfectly well in my application. I run a 12V air compressor mounted in my truck with this from a standard 12V socket in my Mustang. It has never let me down, blown a fuse, or caused any weird power spikes/drops. It serves its purpose well!
Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.With the fine threading it may be stronger but doubt that this feature will make a difference. The split washer is chrome plated which is a mistake as the chroming weakens the washer and a piece off the end cracked off when I first attached the ball to a hitch.The directions state that the nut should be torqued to 450 ft. lbs. which is likely to be an error. Hard to even find a torque wrench that goes up to 450 foot lbs. much less someone who could tighten the nut to that specification without a 4 foot cheater bar.Nice to have something other than a standard flat or Phillips head screw if you have a nice plate frame or even a backup camera mounted over your plates. If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket, these screws will most likely be too big to fit. I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in. Ended up with a nice tight fit. Add the little plastic caps for a nice clean look.Cruiser Accessories 82050 Screw Covers, Black
Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.This stuff works. Had a flat in the middle of no where and this got me back on the trail. Works simply. You will need a valve core removal tool and a air compressor. I purchased a &#34;KIT&#34; that has everything you need. Purchased this bottle of &#34;Slime&#34; so incase I get another flat, I will have some. Just a heads up, this is meant at a temporary fix to get you to a repair place. Will last a while.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.
I needed a decent filter wrench for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel.  The filter is up beside the engine and is best reached from below.  This wrench grips the round Amsoil Filter, Which is not wrench friendly with it's smooth surface. It holds the filter securely while I turn it with my 3/8&#34; ratchet using a nine&#34; extension.  Make sure you get the right size range for your filter size.This gauge works perfectly, always giving a correct reading and fits on the back tire of my Yamaha XJ650 no problem which is hard there isn't much room between the valve stem and the break drum.  Its small size allows me to carry it in my riding jacket pocket so I can check the pressure of my tires anywhere!  You can't go wrong with this gauge.I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle.
Very good purchase for the money. Very good quality and worth what I paid. Like I said in the title, it's huge. I can get the zippers to about 2 inches apart with a 3X motocross helmet with the visor attached. If I take the visor off, it has plenty of room to spare. I don't think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag.I use an &#34;AFX FX-17 size 3X&#34; sold here on Amazon, if you want to see what visor I'm talking about.I like that once my helmet, goggles and gloves are dry I can store them all in this bag.This is a nice product to have if you dont want to pay for your car to get detailed.  I like the ease of using this Powerball by just pairing it with my drill.  No cords and i can easilly maneuver it.  Cheap alternative if you dont want to do manual waxing.  I love the result and i enjoy cleaning my car.  This product work as expected and it comes with a free wax too.I bought this because I was in need of one for my car.  It is simple to use and does the job for an inexpensive tire gauge.  You can use it to measure your current tire gauge as well as deflate your tire if you have too much air.
MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank.I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a "jump" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The "booster car" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a "dead" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the "dead" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!  They are inexpensive and top notch quality!
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat.What can we say about this thermostat? It is a Stant. Arguably, the best thermostat available for cars. It was priced right and processed/delivered promptly.
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellNo one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.I changed out all my rear diff fluid with this Lucas oil. I mean, its just diff oil, but with lucas, you cant go wrong: synthetic 75w140 for all temps, limited slip friction modifiers already in there, this is erfect use for those who want to do this, and not change it again in a long time.only con, the one gallon jug is kinda hard to use to fill the small fill hole without a funnel, alternaively, you can get 4 of those 1 quart squirt bottles and it would be easier.
The plastic is very good quality, the brush does a great job...not much else to say...no complaints. I prefer using a brass scraper as it won't scratch the glass as easily as plastic (this scraper WILL scratch paint/glass if you aren't careful).a little disappointed. Did not work as well as the Chrome wheel cleaner.Truly does exceed expectations.  Perfect size.  Keeps the nuts/bolts together with the sockets and screwdriver tips. As others have noted, the magnets are really strong and can hold bigger items as well as smaller items.  And finally, since its magnetic, it can be easily stored out of the way (with nuts) by slapping on the side of a metal tool chest.
If you want this in chrome type the letter C infront of it in your search.  I love the welded nut option it is a life saver for motorcycles or small engine bays.First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...
I use this to equalize the grey tanks when camping for 4 days or more. In cold weather we take showers in the camper so the grey tank in the bedroom fills up in 4 days.  This lets us divide the grey water from the kitchen with the one in the bedroom.  It also ads a little capacity because it stores water in the pipes down to the valve.  When dumping just take the cap off of this valve, install hose, close both grey valves, open this valve to drain pipes, drain black tank, open both grey tanks again, rinse and done.I own an '06 Dodge Ram Diesel that holds 12 qts of oil.  I installed a quick drain on my truck and find the opening of this container to be large enough to just drain the oil right into the container then right down to the oil recycle place I go.  I drain the filter into a drain pan though then pour into the container.The container is rugged enough for many oil changes and would recommend to others.I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.
Other than it being SIGNIFICANTLY heavier (and perhaps of better quality as a result?), this pulley is good stuff.  It doesn't come with the mounting bolt, so be sure to knock that out of the pulley it's replacing.  I'm confident this will last.Like so many with Odyssey transmission problems, I tried this product as a last ditch effort.  It does appear to smooth the transmission to some degree, but it doesn't make the bigger issue with the shudder go away.  Obviously, this is not a miracle fluid and works within the boundaries of a somewhat normally function transmission. I believe my problem is with the torque converter, which this fluid cannot &#34;magically&#34; fix.To be honest, there are tons of these gap gauges around, made by all sorts of different companies. I dont actually think that this gap gauge is any better than the others, but it does its job, so it deserves 5 stars. On top of that, im dealing with iridium plugs, so you would need a gap gauge like this to do the job right. (the coin gap gauge will damage your precious metal!!!)Great stuff overall!
I'm still a two bucket wash system kind of guy. I usually use the Optimum regular car wash and have had this &#34;no Rinse&#34; on my shelf for months and never tried it as I could not see it working as good. Fast forward to a road trip this summer were I was forced to use it. I had my 2 buckets with me and washed the car in the hotel parking lot.Recommend adding one step to the process. Get one of those pump up 1 liter garden sprayer bottles and fill it with the solution of no rinse. Spray one side of the car and let it soak a couple of min. Start at one end of the car with your sponge or mitt and do one panel. Dip it in the rinse pail to clean off your mitt and dip it back in the soap pail to go over the area again. Then use your drying microfiber towels to dry off the cleaned area.I have to say the car had this gleam that actually looked better than when I used the car wash and hose. This product seems to lubricate the paint up to protect it from scratches while removing the dirt and also leaves very little water on the paint so drying is a breeze.I highly recommend this product and carry my pump sprayer in the trunk always to take care of those bird droppings and bugs when you can't get to a hose.Would buy again!I have had this Prestone Bug Wash in my washer fluid reservoir for a few days now and I really like it.  I recently moved to the coast of southern Georgia, where there are a lot of bugs.  I was used to a lot of bugs having lived in rural Pennsylvania and Maryland, but some of the bugs down here are...messier...for whatever reason.  I also park under trees at the house and the office, and with the higher consistent temperatures, sap has become a real issue. I have noticed already that this bug wash does a great job of getting the sap off the windshield where the typical blue stuff I had been using tended to smear or do nothing to the windshield.  This bug wash gets it all off as far as I can tell.I am ordering another bottle for my wife's minivan!Note:  I was completely out of washer fluid when I put this in, so I am using it full strength right out of the bottle.  I cannot speak to its effectiveness if it is mixed with other washer fluids or water.Update 11.11.13I have used an entire reservoir on my car since I bought the first bottle, and I am buying more to replace it.  It continues to work well in getting off the sap and the bugs.  There are some drops of sap from a large pine tree in our yard that take a few tries to get off because they are so thick, but this Prestone Bug Wash does the trick.  I did add it to my wife's minivan after my initial review, topping off her tank, which had about a 1/4 of a reservoir left of the "blue" stuff.  It works well on the van, even diluted with normal washer fluid.  I still highly recommend this washer fluid if you are dealing with tree sap.  It works on bugs too, but I've noticed it more on the sap.My '99 Bounder diesel had Valterra valves on it, but the handle for my grey water tank had one half snap off in the cold one year.Plus, after 15 years, said grey water valve's seal had started to drip a tiny bit.  My wife can smell a flea's fart from a mile, so I knew about it in short order.Now, it was a definite challenge to get the seals to remain in place while wedging the valve into place, though I put a thin coating of silicone grease on mine to both prevent leaks and prolong lifespan, but I found, if I loosened the hose clamp holding the pipe to the tank, I could twist the pipe and push it in...GENTLY.  This gave me enough room to get both the grey and black tank valves in place, seals properly seated.
I just ordered this for my new trailer but I installed it about 8 years ago on my last trailer and it works like a charm. This is so easy to use at dump stations or at sites to clean out tanks. I simply attach the hose to it and turn it on and it will spray the inside of the tank and well as fill it fast to dump it out clean. We travel all summer and fast means everything when the families packed and ready to pull out.If you are handy ((I would rate this install on a scale of 1 to 10 for difficulty a 5)) you can install it to your tank. My last trailer the black tank was exsposed under trailer so it was super easy. Just drill down 2 inches from top of tank at opposite end (if you can) of drain out with a 1-1/4 inch wood type drill. Anu central location of tank will be fine.Then add silicon around hole insert sparyer and screw in 3 screws. Thats the hardest part. Then you run the hose from tank to the side of the trailer and screw that in. Once the silicon drys your all set. I never had a problem with it leaking ever and I used it hard for 8 summers. Does a great job!My new trailer the tanks are enclosed under a plastic type covering which I had to pull off one side 10 feet to get to tanks. It was not really that big a deal and the covering screwed back up like new. Maybe someone less handy may want to see whats involved on their unit 1st to see what it will take to install.UPDATE JUNE 2013. I just bought A motorhome and 1st thing I did was install flush to black tank and like always works like a charm!!!It also says right on package If it starts to leak find Alan wrench and tighten inside it may come a little loose and drip, no big deal.This product will make your life so easy specially when your in line at a dump station and want to rinse your tank and get moving.I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank.  Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon.  But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work.UPDATE:  I was able to actually use this in my generator afterall.  I had to insert the hose at an angle to reach a certain part of the gas tank and it worked like a charm. But, you need to use the up/down motion really really fast to start it off and then it will siphon. I guess it takes a little practice and a little patience. Once you get it right you'll have no problem doing the next time. I keep this in my truck now in case I ever need it.I could give you a long review full of performance enhancement claims, but I'll just be blunt. Ever since I switched to K&N, my used oil seems less dirty when I drain it and having the 1" nut welded to the top of the filter makes changing it a breeze. If you own a car with a hard to reach filter, that nut alone will make it worth every penny of the filter's cost. I have a Toyota Camry where I can barely even get my hand back to the filter through the tiny opening, let alone get enough leverage to loosen it by hand or use a conventional filter wrench. Not an issue with this filter. 1" socket on a ratchet with an extension shaft and it comes right off in just a few seconds.
I keep this in the garage for when we're going out or I'm meeting a client and don't have time to get the cars washed and waxed.I use a microfiber cloth spray generously -- it leaves the car shining and with a water repellant coating - you can see the water bead up if you get hit with rain after using it.Only pulled one star back because it can take a couple passes to get a car clean if you haven't pre-washed it (which would defeat the purpose).  If you just spray and wipe, it tends to smear alot of dust and dirt around with visible residue.Either way, at a great Amazon price, its an essential for the trunk or garage.Great way to protect your gauge - A MUST HAVE EXTRASome reviewers have commented on this being difficult to fit.The leaflet recommends use of silicon spray, however even easier with hot water.1- Bowl of HOT (not boiling but HOT), leave the cover sitting in the hot water for a good 5 minutes.2- Rub a few splashes of water around the gauge.3- Take the boot out of the water (keep it hot and wet).4- It will then slip straight on, just wipe off the water and then let it dry.JOB DONE !Just remember to use some thread tape or sealer when re-fitting the hose.Although sold for automobile bulb sockets (for which it works great), this product is actually silicon grease. "Dielectric" means that the silicon grease is an electronic insulator. See also Fantasea Silicon Grease Lubricant, "for all types of O-Rings"Although ordinary automotive grease is very damaging to rubber products, silicon grease is great for ANY rubber products, and for use on ANY electronic connection (other than high-voltage switches). Not only does silicon grease prevent corrosion at electrical contacts, it also improves existing contacts.THE DREADED BLUE SCREEN OF DEATHAfter about 5 years of flawless operation, recently I got a "blue screen of death" on my computer, mentioning a parity-check error. Attempts to restart the computer just brought up the same "blue screen of death"---I could not even get to the minimal Windows configuration for trouble-shooting. I removed the memory boards, cleaned the contacts with isopropyl alcohol, applied a thin layer of silicon grease to the contacts on the memory boards, and reinstalled the memory. Since then (a year ago), the computer works perfectly.More recently my other (ca 10-year-old) computer has been getting progressively flakier for about 5 years---if I opened and closed several demanding applications and/or surfed the web extensively---a lockup or crash was likely---so I routinely rebooted several times a day to avoid the lockups/crashes. Occasionally, even freshly booted up, I could not access certain files or folders (the only solution was to clear the recycle bin, delete the file or folder, and then restore it from the recycle bin). Running registry repair programs and other diagnostics did not help. Completely reformatting the harddrive and reinstalling Windows and all my programs from scratch did not help. A new harddrive did not help. About once a month, the computer crashed with a parity-check error message---which began me thinking that I might have a similar problem with the memory board contacts. So during my last annual "spring cleaning" of the inside of the computer (particularly the CPU cooler), I also made a point of pulling the memory boards one-at-a-time (blowing any dust out of the contacts with canned air), applying silicon grease to the contacts, and reinstalling the memory boards. Since then (3 months ago) the computer has been working like new. REALLY!It would be a good idea to coat the contacts of any boards or memory with silicon grease before installing.EXAMPLES OF AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRIC USESDoes your car refuse too start when it's been raining for days? You could replace the entire ignition harness (for perhaps $100 plus labor)---or just coat the wires with silicon grease, being particular generous at the spark plug and distributor connections. No need to wipe off excess. Also pull off the spark plug wires (one at a time so you don't confuse them) and put a dollop of grease on the contacts.Replacing your car battery? This stuff is far better than the petroleum jelly your father used to protect the contacts from corrosion.EXAMPLES OF PLUMBING USESIs your bathroom faucet leaking? Disassemble it, clean it, and rub silicon grease into all of the rubber seals. Let it set, wipe off excess, reassemble. Does your toilet run on and on after you flush it? Same solution.EXAMPLES OF USES AS A LUBRICANTIs the A/C plug for your juicer hard to push into the socket? Add a generous coating of silicon grease and stick it in and out of the socket several times to lubricate the socket. Petroleum-based grease or oil may conduct electricity and burn---making the connection worse. Silicon grease will not conduct electricity nor burn.Is the door lock of your car stiff? Same solution, slather silicon grease on the key, and lock/unlock the door several times.IMPROVING ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONSDoes the right or left channel of your headphones drop out or sputter? Silicon grease will improve the connection.Do you have to shake your TV remote to make it work? Silicon grease will improve the batteries connections.Have you noticed? 40 years ago leaking battereies destroyed uncountable flashlights and transistor radios. Everyone knew that you had to remove batteries when not in use. But then batteries improved in the 1980s and 1990s and almost never leaked. But once again, batteries are leaking and damaging equipment. Silicon grease will at least protect your contacts from minor leaks, and will improve already damaged contacts.RECONDITIONING RUBBER PRODUCTSDoes wind noise at high speed because of a poor door seal drive you crazy? Coat the seal with silicon grease. Rub it in, let it set, wipe off excessDo you have a classic car with stiff dried-out rubber seals? This stuff is first aid. If they aren't too dead, silicon grease will bring them back to life, and protect them from further deterioration.Sliding windows in your van hard to open/close? Coat the channels with silicon grease.Within reason, you cannot use too much. Unlike ordinary oil and grease silicon grease does not attract dirt.CAUTIONSilicon grease is NOT a replacement for petroleum-based grease as a lubricant for continuously moving mechanical parts. While silicon grease can "recondition" rubber belts and rollers (in computer printers, etc) it can also make them too slippery to do their job (instead use CaiKleenTM RBR Liquid, oiler dispenser concentrate 25 mL). Silicon grease can interfere with repainting cars---so it is best to avoid getting silicon grease on painted surfaces, particularly if you anticipate repainting the surfaces in the near future. In high-voltage switches, arcing can create silicon carbide which will deteriorate the contacts.To see my"How to Repair electronic devices damaged by bad batteries","How to Improve Rubber Seals or Revitalize Rubber Items", and"How to Improve electrical connections" guides,click on "See all my reviews" above, then click on "So you'd like to know" guides on the left side of the page
I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.I had mixed feeling about this stuff. I sprayed it on rubber seal as directed ( can says very little about product or direction) It foams on the turns to a liquid . Then it starts to run and drip on RV and eventually dries. It did not stain Rv but it was messy as foam turned to liquid.It works like any spray on tire shine on the market you spray on tires. In fact that's what I did with what was left over with 2/3 a can left used it on tires. It went on the turned to liquid and dried to a nice shinny, non sticky clear coating on the RV tires and my cars. I don't know if it will hold up as long or maybe longer then the tire spray I can buy for 4 .00 a can verse this stuff at 12.00 only time will tell. It claims that it has UV inhibitors so that's a good thing to keep tires on RV from cracking from sun. If it lasts a long time on tires then this will last even longer on  rubber seals on Rv and I will change it to  5 stars, But time will only tell!I am hopping it eliminates that annoying rubber squeaking on slide out  when the motorhome is driving down the road and is why I tried it anyway.I use it on a 17 foot Boston Whaler.  I connected it directly to the battery so I can use spot lights, other lighting, charge cell phones, etc.  Can't get any simpler.  Basically a piece of useful junk.  Recommend it.
good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.It is exactly as it is advertised. It seems well built. If this is what you need just buy it.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPSJust the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.I failed when purchasing this tool.  I was trying to substitute for the real full size kit to do some of my jobs.I stongly suggest that you don't follow in my foot steps.I couldn't even use it once.  Myabe it could have been that it didn't offer the right size or configuration for the car i was working on that day.  But there is something else that is wrong with going with a tool like this.  Even if it had the right size or configuration, If the caliper piston has come out too far for this tool to fit in between the caliper and the piston then it would render it useless.I would recommend Astro Pneumatic 78618 Brake Caliper Wind Back Tool Set - 18 Piece.  Whether it's for professional use or personal, I strongly suggest a tool like this one.  It's going to be worth the investment, trust me.  As of this review time it's currently $36.92 from Amazon.Good luck
What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know.I've been using Royal Purple engine oil for some time and they make a great product so I figured with my transmission fluid / filter change coming up, I'd switch it to Royal Purple as well. You may thing this is expensive but if you look at the manufacture transmission oil, it is actually more. Now not many go to the manufacture anyway but that brings me back to you get what you pay for so you can go much cheaper but you may pay for that in the transmission later. With a reputation like Royal Purple already has and my personal experience with their other products, I knew I could not go wrong here either. It's only been in the truck for a day but if there is anything other than the great performance I expect, I'll update this to let you know. I highly recommend this product.Very good purchase for the money. Very good quality and worth what I paid. Like I said in the title, it's huge. I can get the zippers to about 2 inches apart with a 3X motocross helmet with the visor attached. If I take the visor off, it has plenty of room to spare. I don't think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag.I use an &#34;AFX FX-17 size 3X&#34; sold here on Amazon, if you want to see what visor I'm talking about.I like that once my helmet, goggles and gloves are dry I can store them all in this bag.
Was looking for something like this for the underside of my box for my side x side, the exhaust gasket let go on both pipes an blew out the center of the sheet protecting the underside. saw this stuff on here and did some research on the web on their products. looks like this is what I needed and they been making this great shielding for a while. so if you need heat shielding of all sorts, this is the company to look up .These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***I have a tandem-axel trailer, and the suspension is such that when one tire is on this Leveler, the trailer is NOT lifted high enough to get the 2nd tire off the ground too.  This has the effect of putting unevenly distributed weight on the axels AND limiting the leveling effect.If you have a single axel, this will work GREAT.  I'm still giving this 5-starts based on it's solid construction and how easy it is to back up onto a stepped ramp.  But, if you have tandem axels AND their suspension is like mine...you'll need to pass on this one.  I gave mine to a friend with a single-axel tent-trailer, and he loves it.
This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag.Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires.I bought this, set the code by turning the screw inside the front of the unit, and sprayed with a silicone lubricant.After a month on the front bumper, in the WA rain, there's no sign of rust and the inside tray is dry.The thumb-wheels turn easily and front face plate is tight.I can't find fault with this and it seems pretty secure.Since I can't predict when and where I might lock myself out of the truck, I just leave this on the front receiver by CURT where it fit's just fine with the smallest gasket.I'm very happy with this purchase.
The last time I drained my gray water tank on my trailer, I sort of cross threaded the cap and busted off on the the tabs, making the cap unusable.This is a great replacement and I like the fact that I can attach a hose to the cap to drain my gray water tank into a container, or if I am boondocking/dry camping, I can just run the hose away from my trailer to drain the sink water!This bottle won't last long because it takes quite a bit of the product to cover all four wheels. I spray on, use a dedicated brush to scrub the dirty spots and rinse off. Make sure you don't use the same sponge or brush on the rest of your car or else the brake dust will eat your paint.Your wheels typically have a clearcoat, and this is sprayed on, then using a soft brush, you can get all the brake dust off, then rinse the wheel.  But you can ALSO spray the rest of your car with this.  Brake dust settles on the lower part of your car's front doors, so you can spray these along the bottom.  I use my hand (with a glove) to rub the liquid as I hose it down, and it cleans all of the dust and much of the road tar, meaning very little use of the abrasive clay that most detailers will resort to for tough spots.  This is a less aggressive alternative to clay, and should be in every car-lover's arsenal.Recommended!
I used this sand paper to wet sand a set of headlights and it worked amazingly. Unlike cheaper sand paper this one didn't shred apart so I recommend you buy the good stuff. In my experience 3m makes some awesome products and shopping on amazon will save you a few dollars also.I used this wax on my Platinum Gray VW and the surface had a near perfect mirror reflection.  I will continue to use this waxIf you have never used a clay bar on your car - buy this kit.  You will be amazed at the results.
Slime is a really great product.  You can use it on any tire from your garden tiller to your SUV.  The bottles come in different sizes to cover a range of tire sizes.  You need to own some sort of tire pump to apply this product to the tire and usually that means some sort of air compressor.  A bicycle pump will work for bike tires, though.Slime doesn't have a pressurized propellant in the bottle, so there's no danger to you or to a tire technician.  It can be a little messy if you decide to remove a tire from its rim.  A small price to pay for a safe and effective product.Needed for the 2010 Toyota Sienna.  I tried some others and they don't allow you to take off the canister.  This is necessary if you want to change your own oil.So many people who clean their own cars never clay (most never heard of it).  It's so simple to do, just once every few months do a clay of your car. This kit is great, because it includes a bottle of Quik Detailer. You spray the Quik Detailer, rub the clay, and *bam* watch your car shine.If you want to save money, you could just buy the clay seperately and use some sort of liquid.  Clay does require a liquid application in order to work.  But if you just want to save hassle and get it all in one shot, do this.  Then you can figure out how to save money after you've got the hang of claying.
Purchased this aerosol can when I was about to renovate a couple of corroding, outdoor light fixtures.  After completely taking the light fixtures apart, and using a bit of elbow grease with a wire brush, cleaned the parts, we applied the Permatex Rust Treatment.  Lo and behold, the rust disappeared and a black coating emerged.  Afterwards, we applied a coat of U-POL ACID #8 Etch Primer and two finishing coats of Rust-Oleum, turning the aging light fixtures in brand new ones.My black seven-year old car had very heavy swirl marks after a "detailer" at a car wash removed hard water spots from the paint.  The car looked horrible; it looked worse clean than when it was dirty.  I decided that there was nothing I could do to make it look worse, so, rather than repainting the car, I decided to try to restore my car's paint.  Since I have no experience in using DA polisher or any compounds, I searched the web for the instructions and watched a video (see comments for URL).I washed and clayed the car with Mother's Clay Bar. Then I used Ultra Cut compound with Meguiar's DA polisher and Meguiar's 7006 cutting pad followed by Meguiar's Ultra Finishing Polish using the same DA polisher and Meguiar's 9006 pad.  I saw an impressive reduction in swirl marks and scratches.  The black paint looked almost like a mirror.  I could not remove every single scratch, but the paint looked much better than before and much better than paint on many seven year old cars.After Cutting and Finishing compounds, I applied Meguiar's Mirror Glaze and two coats of Meguiar's NXT was.  It worked very well.  I am extremely happy with the results.A month later I tried Meguiar's Ultimate Compound followed by Glaze and NXT, but I did not see any significant improvement from the earlier results.I was taught to use tide to wash my car as it left a shine and stripped old wax . I bought this and it is suppose to protect wax . I also use the spray wax after . Very pleased and this will provide enough suds for 16 washes almost a summer season . The add on price now can't be beat . I live on a dirt road so I must wash my car this cleans it so I can keep a nice coat of spray wax on it . Then I can hose it off on rainy days when the road has mud . In dry times I use a original Ca Duster to whipe it down to the wax and it looks like I just detailed it . You need a clean car to put wax down and this  does it for  about 30 cents a wash . I use turtle Ice spray wax 470r a synthetic and then Ice Paste . For about half the price of one wax job I am set for almost a season because here in winter you must go to a  indoor pro wash period and make sure you pay for the underside spray with rust inhibitor . God Bless and good luck .
I bought this to try to fix a chip in my brand new windshield. I did not realize that it needed to be done when warm, and needs sun to cure.  Not a complaint but just a heads up. The device is a bit delicate but i think would work fine in the proper conditions. My first fix attempt failed but i plan to retry when it get s bit warmer and the sun shows itself.This was the lowest priced creeper seat w/ prime available.  After a while the cushion flattens out and ur butt gets a little sore.  But i cant complain. I could put an extra pad on there.  I really liket his because i have been sitting on milk crates and i leave tools everywhere.  Now when i use tools i just toss it under me and i can keep track of them better.It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks. I just don't know, I may be doing something wrong. But, I don't think so because I am following the directions on the package. If any one has some tips please post them....................
Easy installation and works as advertised. I see a lot of complaints about the hose being to short but for me it was on the money. I guess there would be instances that you'd need a longer hose but you know you gotta work with what you got. I moved the container closer...I did quite a bit of research before deciding on Dynamat.  There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.  If you have anything to say about my opinions, or would just like to comment on what I have done, please let me know.I was getting the dreaded CEL- check engine light on my 2004 car (9 years; 66,000 miles).  Oh no!  What do I do?  What do I do?  I went to a forum, posted the code and was directed to clean the MAF sensor.  Well, lordy, lordy&#8230; guess what?  My CEL was reset and it has not come back on.  This inexpensive can saved me at least a $200 'stealership' repair bill.  Some people use other products that can actually damage the MAF sensor- don't do that.
Seems well made and works as it should. Like the fact it has the LED's which is a quick and easy way to see if your vehicles wiring is working as it should and can point you in the right direction if you may be having an issue with your trailers lightsHI,This product is a great product that helps you to eliminate rattles/vibrations when you are installing speakers into a vehicle's car doors, rear panels, decks, etc.  It does exactly that and it does it well.There are many claims about it stopping distortion, noise, etc....  However, it should be noted that if you are over powering a speaker..distortion will occur and no padding can stop that.Dynamat has been around for ever and continues to provide a solution that eliminates rattle and vibration.  Use it for that and you will agree that it is a 5 Star Product.  Expect miracles and you will be disappointed.You certainly don't want your expensive rack to get stolen.  This is cheap insurance.  Fits well and works well.  I do not leave my rack on all the time so this lock/pin does not see harsh weather or repeated rains.  For me, it works exceptionally well.  I like the fact that after it is unlocked, to relock doesn't require the key, you can just insert it back on and it is locked.
I used this products on numerous stains on my carpet. I followed the directions on the can and it removed all the old and new stains on my carpet. I will buy again!Got this because I needed a clean one so I can reuse my new differential fluid while fixing the gasket.I put this on my hitch attached to my camper to get room past my spare tire when hauling bikes.  Highly reconned!!
This product leaves a nice smooth feel & shine. The price is right too. It applies easily, and works well on dark or light colors.My Harley has a lot if black on the motor. It's a 2003 and very gradually the black will loose it's rich dark look. This product really brought back that dark rich look. I recommend it.These bulbs work as described. The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues. They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs, but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness.
i did nt notice any difference to be honest with youchemical guys leather cleaner is better in the sense that it removes dirt from leatheryou should not scrub hard on leather because it will remove the beautiful grain from the leatherwith zymol you have to scrub hardchem guys not soo muchbecause this one came with the replacement cap, it gets 5 stars.  Those cheap plastic caps with the enormous 32mm head suck and whoever designed them should be shot.  I cant tell you how many times I have done the oil change after someone else and this freakin plastick piece would not come out without warping and damaging it.  If you have not done your oil change yet, you will be glad you have a spare plastic cap on hand.  I recommend changing every 4-5 oil changes even if you dont damage because of the o-ring and the fact that plastic of any grade is not designed to withstand the constant temperature range of hot engine oil.Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc.
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.Good purchase, recommended.Built well, nice thick plastic that can take the heat of a hot drain. I do not see any manufacturing seam on the bottom that someone commented on as a design weakness. The base looks like it was molded in one piece, with the only seam being the top edge flange and spout, and all of that is much higher than the main tank, and well away from any location that would get dragged across the floor.The snout of this thing fits easily into an empty jug of Mobil 1 to pour and cap for the recycling truck.Just got a vehicle with a SEVEN quart capacity crankcase. Imagine my surprise when the old 5 Qt pan started looking reeeely full.  Grab that cork in a hurry.I don't plan to run this one up anywhere near its 18 quart capacity, at least when it comes to an oil change, but y' know, maybe it'll come in handy for the radiator when I swap the coolant with fresh every few years.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.I received it as a gift a few weeks ago, and am selling it again.There is no real benefit of having such a unit.First, the mounting is an issue as you have the cable running across your dashboard. Having a second plug on the right side is interfeering with gear shifting and whatever controls you have in your center console. It would be better to have a plug on the left side. Using the one in the back makes the cable run all across the dashboard, no thank you.Second, besides the tachometer (if you don't have one) what data readout do you really need? Really need? Nothing, exactly. Codes can be red out by any Auto place for free, and what are you doing if your converter speed is at a certain speed? Exactly, see what I mean? Okay, volts maybe, but just maybe.The unit, sent back to ScanGauge for testing, does hardly come on by itself, so you don't really know if any of the fuel/trip data is accurate. This makes it already questionable, and therefore I do not have any use for it.So, for us it is another item where we have to question its quality and reliability.Less than 1 month old, contact me if you want it. I take of 20% right away.If you have an RV with load-range tires that require 80psi, then spend the extra coins for a compressor that is dependable in a roadside emergency.  With the extension air hose there isn't any problem reaching the rear wheels on the trailer.  Think about what your needs are and toss those cheaper cigarette lighter plug-in models.  You get what you pay for.  It was nice that the price was reduced 50% when I purchased this one.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!works fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
the product is very easy to use all you have to do is follow the directions and that's about it it will do the rest as it sayIt say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!It does what it's supposed to do and the price is right so I would recommend it if you need to use pop rivets.
My 2003 Silverado 1500 5.3 V* owners manual called for a GF626.....This is the EXACT same fit and goes on  easy. Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid...Fram makes great air filters and this was another one that hit the mark.  My Toyota Sienna is happy with this purchase.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.
They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used. It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available. Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this. Check on forums for you car if you're unsure.If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.
This is one other item you need for your Hi-Lift jack. This allows you to lift curved bumpers, or ones without notches in them specifically for this type of jack. Great small accessory that goes well with the jack itself. Heavy duty and will last many years. I did modify this with some rubber to not mar metal finish of my bumpers though. If you have plastic bumpers, don't use this, it will leave marks. A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained. Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid. This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material. Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job. I added larger ones that are stronger, but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading. You need this for your jack. Will help with some fence posts of odd shape as well.I was extremely disappointed in this item. Most of the Camco stuff I have is pretty good, but the problem with this meter is the clear plastic face is not static proof.When comparing with my Fluke multimeter, this meter reads about 2VAC high at 120VAC; or about 1.6% off.When you get the meter, it has a piece of protective plastic over the bezel, and just removing it will induce enough static electricity to cause the pointer to change.  And if you brush across the bezel with your finger, you can make it read anywhere from 110V to 130V, because the static electricity affects the needle.Most meters use a plastic bezel that is immune to static, and does not do this. I don't know if the problem is the plastic the manufacturer used or perhaps they failed to treat it with some chemical.Sadly there are not a lot of options for other brands. I like an analog meter in this case as you can see voltage fluctuations a whole lot better than you can with a digital meter.Hopefully over time this meter will lose it's sensitivity to static electricity.WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name "weld" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8" steel rod, to another 1/8" steel rod, forming a "T" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1"-long "L's" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the "L"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not "dry"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and "take it easy" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job.
Very happy with this purchase, as it save piling bricks or boards under the trailer tongue jack to shorten the amount of cranking necessary.  I would recommend this to anyone with a trailer.I use this on all my auto bulbs. Helps when you need to remove bulbs especially on my trailers an vintage vehicles. This is a, Must Have Item. I recommend this Dielectric Grease.Great item.  Works just like it's supposed to.  Arrived in mint condition.  Would order another or recommend to a friend who was looking for one.Batter tender is mounted on a wall and these let me charge my bike, or my car outside of the garage.
Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersI used this wax on my Platinum Gray VW and the surface had a near perfect mirror reflection.  I will continue to use this waxIt fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
These are a whole lot better than my stock nozzle. Will spray a fan of fluid, it is adjustable and comes with the adjuster key, silver thing in the picture.The only thing I wish was different was being able to adjust the spray higher than what the limit is at now. It is just barely clearing the whipper blade, but the stock one had been so clogged that is wasn't getting above it at all.It is on a ball type adjustment, so all angles and such, just the angle of my hood is the issue, overall, way better and even spread.had been using so many light bulbs and this one is the brightest one (more far, more wide, and more bright).  It evens wider and far than piaa intense white but it is so easy to burn out.  the first pair burn out after 6 months (no DRL running).  the second pair i think also gone less than a year.  If you don't care the trouble to keep replacing it and $37 dollars less than a year, it is the bulb you need because even tho GE, piaa won't more wide and this long distance.The tender works marginally well and after a few years the grounding prong pulled loose of the plug. I cut the unit's plug off and replaced it. This unit keeps the battery charged but I've noticed my voltmeter reads just over 13 volts every morning so it seems to me that this unit is keeping the battery barely charged instead of fully charged. I recently bought a Solar ProLogix 12 amp battery charger that seems much better built and keeps the battery more fully charged. If the ProLogix literature is to be believed, it is a much more sophisticated unit than the battery tender while the cost is just a few bucks more.
What a load of crap. I just installed it in my 2000 civic and I did not see any REAL noticeable benefit.After all the hype about increased mileage, increased fuel economy, quicker starts, etc, etc. I have yetto clearly perceive any real benefits from using it. I paid a arm and leg for it and cannot realize itsbenefits. For civic owners you can continue using the regular NGK plugs, just change them every 8 monthsand you are good to go. I will not waste any more money on snake-oil plugs like this. I will revert to usingthe regular plugs after I have exhausted using the iridiums (since I already bought them, might as well use them).I haven't ridden enough to know for sure, but these plugs have been great so far.  Idle is way smoother so that I could reduce the idle rpms, and power is better than I remember.  I didn't even check the gap, it looked like the old plugs so just threw them in, so probably it is close enough.However I'm comparing power to memory as the bike had been idle for more than a year and my old plugs were pretty carbon fouled.  So perhaps any new plugs would preform as well.  I had fuel issues and tried cleaning the old plugs but wasn't able to ride since it never rev'd past idle, so can only compare that idle was worse and power now is very good.Also, one of the main benefits of the iridiums is the reported longevity, so there's no way to rate these on that attribute for quite a few miles from now.  I'd definitely buy these over the regular ones again though.  Cost a little over $5 more for two versus the regular plugs so not much of an expense, particularly if they can perform as expected for longer.Star Brite Star Tron Gasoline Additive.  I have a 10 HP Tecumseh engine on a 5000 Watt Generator that for the past two years had become difficult to start and wouldn't run without surging, back firing,etc.,  unless choked two notches . I'VE ALWAYS PUT STA-BIL IN THE FUEL TOO.  Now it does set for long periods without running though. Well after cleaning the bowl jets and still having problems I stumbled on this stuff. So ordered some, (what to lose ?) not much. I had emptied the old gas so put 1 gallon in the generator tank with the dose recommended (doubled) and started the engine. Still needed the two clicks of choke to run without surge etc. when started. I let it run for about two minutes and could hear a smoother sound coming from the engine. But it still needed one click of choke to run without surging. After 15 minutes checked and it ran silk smooth without any choke. Have checked it since and starts on the first pull too. I put it in a Robins 11 HP engine that was getting hard to start and it cured that within 5 minutes of running (cold starts too). Put it in my wife's old car and it runs smoother. Have 4 more small engines I will use this in too. I sound like a commercial but believe me this is worth every penny and cheaper than mechanics too. I have no doubt if used regularly in gas I won't have those problems again. I would recommend this to anyone for small engines, cars, etc. It really does what they say and the proof is in the engine performance.ADDENDUM: There are two concentrated formulas one 143XX for small engines and 930XX for Marine/Standard engines=(AUTO), (XX equals Oz in a bottle). The 930XX is a higher concentrate formula.  I received the 93032 (32Oz bottle) formula but was able to use it in small engines by reducing the amount per gallon and not wasting product that way. 10 Ml of 930(standard formula) is about the same as 1 Oz of 143(small engine formula) for 6 gallons of fuel. The company also says you can't overdose with this stuff. In other words if you put to much you just waste product not harm the engine. By the way 10 bottle caps full equal one Oz of product. Go to the Company web site and read how much to use and that way you will understand better what I have tried to say here. Take it from a 70 year old guy, This stuff is great. Everything I have put this in has increased the idle speed some .  Means water and crude has been removed . I put this in my new 2013 Kia Optima and two things happened, 1. increased idle speed and 2. increased the MPG 1 mile to the gallon. If you don't believe that that's OK I wouldn't and didn't when reading others say that. That car also expelled black crude from the exhaust pipes which is water vapor combined with carbon deposits caused by fuel burning cleaner. Decided we don't know what we are pumping from station storage tanks besides gas but the engines do. I've used this in 5 small engines, an older car, a truck, and a 40HP diesel tractor with improved performance from all of them. Great stuff.
I am NOT impressed with this multimeter.  The controlls are NOT intuitive to anyone who is used to using multimeters.  The battery check function is just a gimmick.  I am NOT comfortable with a meter that ALWAYS shows a reading even when not connected to anything....The product works very well based upon condition of your interior. It will not make your car new, but it does work. Hope this helps.Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon.
I planned on using this unit to charge my auto batteries and then leave it on trickle charge. However, it has a FAN which constantly runs and will wear out, just like the fans in the PC's do. I don't know, but I also bet that if the fan bearings fail and the blades won't spin, the charger microprocessor will not operate for safety reasons. Really poor product design to use up fan life when you want to trickle charge a battery over the winter.The Duracell DPP-600HD Powerpack does serve several uses - some of which it performs above all expectations. However, it is important to remember that it is essentially a giant battery and NOT a generator.One of my complaints is that the unit has a built in monitoring device that provides feedback on the amount of remaining power in the battery. Unfortunately, that feature did not work on mine. I am not sure if my unit is defective... but the display console is essentially useless.PROS-- Will power a cordless phone, modem and router for about 8 hours. We have our phone service through the internet - so when our power is out we lose everything.- It can charge your car battery... in a pinch. I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure that if your car battery wasn't all the way dead the Duracell Powerpack could get you going!- Nice built in flash light and radio. Not of huge use - but in the dark they are nice to have.- Surge protector on the unit - things that pull too much juice will not even come on (like my wife's hair dryer)Cons-- VERY HEAVY - I haven't weighed it but the Duracell Powerpack probably tips the scale at about 25-30lbs. Any many cases it would be too heavy for a women or the elderly.- It is severely limited in the number of amps that you can pull. Again, my wife's hair dryer pulled to many amos - and therefore - would not come on. This severely restricts its use during a power outage. As a rule of thumb only low powered appliances can be plugged in.At the end of the day - for the cost - you could throw in a little more money and buy a generator. While the Duracell Powerpack is silent and does not produces any dangerous fumes it is limited in what you can operate. My recommendation - nice to have in an emergency - but it is not a cure-all if you happen to be out of power. 4 stars.Well to start, this unit seemed well built. Has a little weight to it so I think its built good. I only used it once because it has one poor design issue. "IT DONT LIGHT UP"..no lighted led screen monitor? Like doin a etch a scetch in the old days. lol...All fairness they left it out so you would buy the higher models I guess. Strange part is most of the cheap readers this company makes seem to have lighted displays.I live in an area were its dark at 5pm in the colder part of the yr. I need light. If you dont have sight issues or if you dont care if you have to hold a flash light while looking at codes then go for it...I returned it and bought the 1403. It does more anyway. If you do get the upper models be prepared to get a RS232 to USB adapter plug for them. Not sure why these are not updated to USB? Hope this helps...most people dont seem to care about the light but it makes such a big difference.
This thing works great.  I use it to exhaust when I cook inside to keep the camper from smelling like bacon.  Also use the thermostat for when I'm out of the camper so it kicks on and keeps the inside from getting really hot during the day, works good at night because it will shut off when the temp drops and you don't have to get up freezing and shut it off.I tried this one one of my tires when I unboxed it, and when it shut off the display would never come back on.  I was ready to give up right there until I saw another reviewer had a similar issue, and that it would work again after being unplugged from power and plugged back in.  Right there, that makes this unit a fail for me since if you have to remove power between wheels, it becomes much more of a pain to deal with.  But a few days later, it actually did NOT kill the display after shutting off automatically with one tire, so it wasn't just by design, it seems to just be totally intermittent.The ability to set a pressure and let it stop when it hits that pressure is a great concept, but this thing hasn't worked anything nearly as advertised.  I set if for 38 PSI, since my tires max at 44, and the manufacturer suggests 33, but I like a little stiffer wheels than that.  On one tire it shut off about 37.5, on another I had to stop it at 39 myself because it never did shut off.  On the other two it was about 37.5 or so, acceptable.  You can pick in 1 PSI increments above 30, and it reads in 1/2 PSI increments.  But when I tested with a very good tire pressure gauge, the readings this was giving was really around the scale.  The tire that was inflated to 39 PSI before I shut it off myself was actually at 41.  One of the ones that shut off about 37.5, one was actually 35, one was actually 37.Then there's the issue with the rubber inside the valve piece.  The very first tire I put this on and then removed, a piece of the rubber seal inside the nozzle fell to the floor.  It's like it's dry rotted already or something.  And the plastic lever to lock and unlock is not very strong at all, and bends to the point I'm afraid it will snap when I'm putting it on or off.Nothing about this unit screams quality, which would explain the low price.  The concept is good, but the execution failed in many, many ways.I bought this for my Mom.  She has a riding mower that sometimes sits for a long time without use.  I used the connectors that you screw onto the terminals and then you have a little plug that you then connect to the charging unit whenever you need.  No clamping onto the battery, just plug it in.  You can leave this on all the time and it will shut off when the battery is charged coming on only when needed.  Safe and easy.  Great for over-wintering a battery when you want to keep it charged.Update.  I bought one of these for my truck which is not driven very often.  I first made sure the battery was charged since it is a heavy duty truck battery.  Then I did the screw mount connectors and leave the charger on all of the time.  It keeps the battery charged by shutting on and off as needed.  No need to tend it.Can't say enough good about this product for battery maintenance.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Working well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.
Fits up to bank 1, sensor 1 O2 sensor on 2004 Ford Taurus 3.0L Vulcan Flex. Very high quality socket, which is expected from Lisle. Get the thread chaser from Lisle as well to be sure of a clean thread before installing the the new O2 sensor. Both the socket and thread chaser are offered on Amazon at a very good price.This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM.This adapter works for certain functions, such as the brakes lights and turn signals.  It is missing the center pin ground needed for the running lights to work.  I purchased another manufacturer's unit elsewhere, and the system now works fine.  This is a cheap, inadequate part.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.

IT WORKSIT WORKEDNICE PRODUCT DOES WHAT IS MEANT TO DO. THE TAPE SEEMS TO HOLD PRETTY GOOD ONLY TIME WILL TELL SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ALONG TIME AGO.
I got these nearly 10 years, ago, when they first came out.And, I've had a love-hate relationship with them.They slide around on concrete, when you try to drive on then with the front wheels of a rear wheel drive vehicle.Yes, I got frustrated with the sliding so much that I ran over them once and took chunks off of the very low backstops when they landed on the unibody "pinch weld" rails.  They still worked, however, when I used them, since the under wheel supporting structure on both ramps were still strong.Recently, I did discover how well these worked on a grass dirt surface, especially where I live with hard dense red clay.  They didn't move at all.I was happy until I discovered Race Ramps.Check them out.  They are much better and even lighter than the Rhino Ramps.  They have much higher back stops and they don't slip on either concrete, asphalt, grass or dirt.  They have s solid urethane-rubber coated structual foam surface and rated at 3,000 pounds for the pair.The only downside is that they cost about trice as much as the Rhinos.In the case of Race Ramps, you DO get what you pay for.The Rhino Ramps ar going away to a friend.They do cover up the ugly screws but once winter road salts get on them the chrome turns green and will not clean up. I guess the decision is, do you buy new ones every spring?I'm one of those anal guys who researches most of his purchases, even on small things like wiper blades. Unfortunately, I did not do that when I first replaced the blades on my Nissan Xterra. I replaced the stock ones with something the guys at Napa Auto recommended. During the first winter with them, they behaved as most wiper blades do - poorly. They chattered and squealed when the window wasn't drenched and left streaks or skipped when it was pouring. Like I said, they behaved like most blades. All this despite the fact that I keep the window - and blades - very clean.So this year, after another couple of months of sub-par performance and the scares that sometimes accompany a wet windshield, I decided to look for the the 'best blade'. I read reviews and asked questions on forums and this blade kept coming up. Now that I have it, I can see why.No noise - no matter how wet or dry the window. No skipping or sliding allowing water to remain behind. This thing, while still just a windshield wiper, is truly amazing. Yep, costs twice as much. No idea how it will hold up over the long haul, but I tend to replace blades once a year anyhow. Seriously, if you value the ability to see out of your windshield during torrential downpours or just drizzle - these things are the premier product.
It works well, I wanted to just keep track of how my tire wear was. My only concern was that it is not really calibrated to be right on the money, but if you keep this in mind, it is just an offset.I have a K&N in my car so I decided to add this to the girlfriends.  She has a 2006 Toyota Matrix. It fits snug, but that means there's a good seal. Her stock filter was horribly dirty after just one year, so it'll be interesting how this holds up. It's impossible to tell if there is any improvement in performance. I don't drive it daily so I'm not sure about the gas mileage either. Buy this for its reusability, not its performance. My only complaint is the little "Do Not Discard" sticker isn't sticky enough to attach to the air box.This unit is a new experience in loading and retreiving items from the bed of my pickup. It also makes it easier to was the top of my truck. I would buy it again( that is, if this one ever broke or got lost), which isn't likely ,since it is very durably made.
Used this before & it cleans good. You don't need to over do it with the oil. Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying.i tested it with another gauge and it gave an accurate reading . Make sure you keep it secure to the valve or it will leak air outEventually.  If the O2 sensor leaves mangled threads, this will clean them up without having to pull the manifold.  Great tool
i use this cleaner on my 04 wrx,i run it through the intake,the gas and the oil,as far as running it through the oil you should only do it right before  an oil change as seafoam isnt a lubricant, if you put it in your oil do it before an oil change run your car for about 40 miles then change the oil and you will be goodrunning through your gas is self explanatory just dump it in:)for running through the intake i find the easiest way is to put in through the brake booster,when you do poor it in slowly  otherwise your car will die,the engine may stumble while pouring it in but that's fine,after you've done that shut the car off for about 10 minutes,after that start your car up and go for a drive and enjoy the smoke show,your car will run ten times better afterwords and it will idle smoother as well great product!This product works great because a) it's relatively cheap and b) gives a good shine without looking hideousBasically, it doesn't provide that ultra-greasy look you might get at a $50 detail operated by some homeless looking guy who applied a layer of grease to your tires.  Instead, you get a new-tire looking effect that simply looks good all the time.Easy to apply- just spray on.  However, make sure you try to spray on uniformly and don't put too much.  But before you do that, if you're applying this while the car is in your garage or driveway, cut up some cardboard boxes and drive over them.  This way, all the residual droplets wont stain your concrete.  Let the liquid sit for the recommend amount of time, then go out and use a paper towel to dab, not scrub, away excess dirt and liquid.  Make sure you do not leave any traces of liquid because if you do so, the next time you drive your car, centrifugal force will stream even small traces of excess liquid right off to your side panels.Trivia:  You can't have a sewer hose on the ground in Oregon.  It must be elevated!Betcha didn't know that, but what the heck!  It's always nice to have your "stuff" run downhill into the dump station instead of just sitting there in the hose!  Some people (Joe Flatlanders) carry a rain gutter to accomplish the same thing, but is a rain gutter collapsible into a nice little package with a handle?Word to the wise:  NEVER leave you black tank gate valve open!  It's ok to leave your gray tank open but NEVER leave your blank tank valve open!
This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers.
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.Best Full Synthetic motor oil you can buy next to AMSOIL or Redline.  If you want to do your own research, visit [...] and you can learn a lot.Exactly what I needed to add to my box of wheelin components, I'll save a tree when I need to hook up & pull &#34;other&#34; people out
Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.works fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.this hose feels really sturdy, used it to fix old boat (sold it though), fix transmission and steering lines in cars. this is high quality hose, made in USA
It's sta-bil how can it be wrong and this is the best price I could find. I am very happy.How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!this is the main belt tensioner, i used to replace on a 2005 suburban with 110,000 milles. the part is a good quality original equiptment part. Save yourself some money and do it yourself. in addition to this i also replaced belts (used Goodyear Gatorback) and other tensioners and idler pully bought on amazon.I bought this tool on a whim, since it's fairly cheap, preparing to replace the rear brake pads on my 2003 Beetle 1.8t.  None of the sides had the correct spacing to retract the caliper piston.  I rented a kit from an auto parts store beforehand to be safe and needed it in the end.That said, I am going to keep this tool for future cars.
This is a nice oak cutting board that really does stay in place when you drive. I hated the clanging and rattling of the old metal lid and this does not make a sound. Even when making good time on 3rd world dirt roads that trashed many other things in the RV this top never budged or rattled.I tried many expensive wax before even with Perma Plate sole at dealership(dealer will charge $450 for the job) but, NXT generation wax does the same thing at such low price. You can feel the surface just as smooth as PermaPlate. The best of all, if you apply on the trim and rubber part of the car, It will not leave white residue as other product, and gave the car deeper dark (like new) color.If you have a clear coat scratch, meaning that the clear coat is scratched off and the paint is exposed, then this product is fantastic. It really does work on these types of scratches. If you have a scratch deeper than that, do not bother using this product. Go to the Auto parts store, or the dealer, or on-line and get the exact touch up paint for your vehicle and follow the directions. Good luck - it may never look the same again.
This product is simple to use on single or dual piston calipers. Just put the brake pads in and screw them out. I now do not have to use bulky spreaders anymore. If it ever breaks good luck, otc is not stamped anywhere on it though.this product is great for parking a car in the garage.  Easy to install and see.  i would recommend using additional heavy duty double sided tape to ensure it stays in place.  Be sure to wipe down the concrete with alcohol to eliminate any oil residue on the concrete.I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better.I used this product on my 2014 Genesis Coupe and it is decent. It kind of leaves a semi glossy surface. Nothing that will blind you like some armorall products haha.Using this to paint the shields in a pair of Mini H1's for a retrofit I'm doing, and the color looks great!
These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom.  On some vehicles with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless.These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom.  On some cars with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.
I work as a salesman at a car dealership so I had access to a lift.  If you have access, I strongly recommend using a lift vs. jack stands.  I was able to raise and lower my car so I was always painting the calipers from a comfortable standing height and could look at (and paint) the calipers from different angles to make sure I didn't miss anything.The included brush is downright awful -- plan on buying a decent tiny paintbrush for this purpose.The color is a glossy, fire engine red.  At the same time that I was doing this, I also PlastiDipped my rims a bright white (my Grand Am GT coupe is white as well.)  The contrast is striking!There's plenty of paint in this kit -- easily enough to do two sets of calipers.  I gave my remaining paint to the tech who helped me get my car on the lift and showed me how to use the air tools for my wheels.This is a nice alternative to welding a tab on a hitch for a sway control. While I don't plan on having to move it to another hitch it is nice to know that if I had to I could. Which is something that can't be done with a weld on tab.Since my car is only 2 years old, I chose this Meguiar's #9 Swirl remover as I didn't want to have anything too aggressive. The paint was not in too bad a shape as I always used the 2 bucket hand wash method. Just light swirling on my grabber blue paint. To prepare the surface I washed the car then used Meguiar's clay bar to remove any embedded matter in the paint. Surprising what is in there after only 2 years even though the paint looked clean to the naked eye. After the claying I got out the Porter Cable polisher. Since this is an orbital polisher it is good for anyone who is new to using a power tool on your paint. This was my first time. It was quite simple actually. I mentally divided the hood into 5 section and did one at a time putting an X pattern on the Meguiar's polishing pad with the #9 Swirl remover. I did 4 section passes on each area and then used a microfiber towel to take off the excess polish. I could immediately see that the pad I used (Meguiar's 6.5-Inch Soft Buff Foam Polishing Pad) was just enough to do an excellent job. You see, since the paint was only 2 years old I didn't need a too aggressive polish, or a pad that cut too much. So if your car is in similar condition this may be a good combination for you. This I guess is why you do a test are first and not the whole car. After I was satisfied that this was the right combination, I moved on and finished the car. If it did not do the trick, I could use more pressure, a more aggressive pad, ramp up the speed on the polisher (I used setting 5 for this) or maybe bought a more aggressive polish. I really liked this stuff. Quite easy to do and I wasn't afraid that the polish would burn through my clear coat. I finished it up with Meguiar's liquid Ultimate Wax. The car looked when I waxed it the first time. I might try topping it off with some carnauba wax, but its not really needed.
Installed these on the front corners of the travel trailer. Works great. Saves me from having to run around with the bubble level checking to see if the trailer is level front to back and side to side. Seem to stick pretty well also. Very Happy so far. Fast ship from Amazon.Fits my 2006 Honda Civic EX perfectly.  There's an arrow on one side of the filter, indicating direction of air-flow, which you match up to the arrow on the air-filter frame.  Love the convenience of not having to go to the dealer, or even the auto-parts store.I double checked Amazon's part recommendation for my car against FRAM's website before ordering, and Amazon's recommendation was accurate.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.
good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.
I live in an apartment with an attached indoor parking lot, so no water hose or anything.Every weekend (as best as I can), I head down there with a bag containing this No Rinse solution, a microfiber sponge, a couple of towels, a Windex spray, a gallon of water in a bottle, and a bucket. 2 caps of the No Rinse and 20 minutes later, my car is clean and shiny. No hassle, no water wasting, no hose needed.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Had no problems starting my full size pickup.  Can't ask for more.  I like the charging system.  Just use an extension cord - no little adapter to loose. No frills and does the job.  Will give five stars if it lasts.

I got this along with my tire gauge and it did fit on without taking the gauge apart, just like one of the previous reviewers said. The mold release compound on the rubber (the white dust you can see in the picture) was ugly, so I gave it a spritz of 303 Protectant (I'm sure Armor All would work, too) and it transformed into a piece of equipment that looks like it belongs in a better garage than mine ...I concur with the other reviewers that one should read the instructions well before attempting the repair.I used the repair kit to repair one 1.5 inch diameter star-burst and two small nick/chips - one of which was in driving view.I ensured the car was in the shade and cleaned out the crushed glass out of the rock impact area with the included blade. I cleaned the repair area with soap water and a glass cleaner till it was squeaky clean.I secured the repair assembly, with the 4 (good quality!) suction cups, to the windshield centering the housing over the rock impact area. I screwed in the resin delivery tube into the housing till it's rubber tip was flush with the windshield and centered to the damage area. I then added a few drops of resin (is same consistency as 3-in-1 oil) into the delivery tube and finally inserted the pressure tube which forces the resin into the crack by opening the rubber tip. I let it cure for about 10 minutes after which I placed a drop of resin on the center of the crack and placed the clear plastic sheet on it and put the windshield in direct sunlight - waited another 10 minutes and removed the plastic sheet. I scraped the excess resin with the blade.I was very happy with the results - the damaged area, filled in with the resin, was see-through, not smoky like I have seen other windshield repairs. The cracks filled to the extent that the crack was accessible. The resin could not repair a "fracture" as there is no way for the resin to reach in between the fracture. The resin did obliterate the crack lines where it did reach.The end result is that the star-burst is still there but less visible, both the nicks/chips are reduced significantly (90%+) and I can make them out only because I know where they are. The one in my driving view looks like a small pit instead of a chip. The only thing I am waiting for, this winter, is to see if the resin holds up to the heating/cooling.It took me about 1 hour to repair all three areas.The product is designed thoughtfully and is effective. The quality of materials is good. The really great thing about this product is the fact that the resin cleaned off with soap/water and did not harden on the skin. I could clean out the delivery and pressure tubes which means that they can be re-used......there is enough resin/plastic sheets left to repair a few more cracks.DON'T use more that a few drops of resin...a little goes a long way!I gave one-less star for false advertising. The company surely knows that fractures in glass cannot be repaired and should not advertise an "after" photo which shows a windshield with no hint of having been damaged.Bought this for my wife's Yaris, just to try it out. I had installed Bosch wipers, but they started to fall apart after about 9 months. The Rain-X Latitude is quite unique. It is pre-curved and basically one piece. The curved blade is part of a curved frame that simply attaches to the wiper arm.Installation took about a minute. The hardest part was getting the Rain-X blade out of the package. Sprayed some Rain-x water repellent on the windshield after installing this (and a slightly different Rain-X blade for the passenger side -- smaller and not available in the Latitude series). The results were great. The blades moved across the windshield glass perfectly. No gaps, no streaks, no noise. I think the graphite coating on the Latitude makes a big difference. If they hold up as I'm pretty sure they will, these are my go to brand from here on out. Very satisfied.
This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.I have a 2000 Mustang GT convertible that I keep garaged and drive on nice,sunny days. I had been using a cheap trickle charger from Harbor Freight. Recently I discovered the battery had died so I decided it was time for a &#34;real&#34; charger. The reviews were great so I decided to give it a try. It is a small but powerful unit. It took  my battery from stone dead  to a full charge within 24 hours and it automatically maintains a full charge. It uses LED lights to let you know the status of your battery. I wish it had a gauge instead of the lights but I still would highly recommend this to friends and family.I use this to monitor my RV battery.  Even though I have a solar system charge controller which displays voltage too, I use this sometimes to double check before I plug additional items in one of several 12 volt sockets I had installed.  I like it so much for its simplicity, that I'm buying a 2nd one for my truck.  This gadget is so simple to use and so accurate, that if you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.  More than worth the price!  Gives me a peace of mind at a glance.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.This is a great little charger unit.  It is not actually a battery maintainer like some of the real expensive units out there.  I have a &#34;BatteryMinder Unit&#34; which is a real maintainer but at 5 times the cost too! ($85)  This will charge a battery, and will float the charge at a very low rate of charge input to &#34;maintain&#34; the full charge level.  For the money it costs, this is a very nice little unit.  If you are using it on a large car or truck battery, this will maintain the charge, but is a bit small to attempt to charge a low or dead battery if it is a large one.  For small batteries and such, this will charge them just fine.  I use it to maintain a motorcycle battery with no problem.  Schumacher is an excellent long time company and with Amazon's guarantee you won't go wrong.  Enjoy!
This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.
It does what it's intended to do - charge or maintain a battery.  I bought two of these to use on a boat battery and RV battery during winter storage.  First one is 4 years old and second one was purchased last month.  Both are going strong.  The only drawback is they do make a very distinct high-pitch humming noise while charging.  I keep them in the basement though so they are not heard.  If they're going to be used within constant earshot, may want to reconsider.These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights.After 5 years the rear tail light bulb on my SUV went bad, I picked these up and went to replace them and found out that what my SUV came with from the factory was this exact same bulb.Replacement was a snap (2 screws and I was done).I will be frank.  I'm an avid lover of Amazon and its low prices. These were more expensive here on Amazon but if you want to avoid a trip to the automotive store or you don't have an automotive store these'll come to your door although the automotive store has the database that tells you what vehicle it fits (would be great if amazon had a similar database - hint hint).Bear in mind, these bulbs fit dozens of vehicles but you need to know the part number that you need before you order.  Also, installation difficulty also varies by vehicle.  I'm handy around vehicles and have tools so it was a pinch for me, but if you're not mechanically inclined you might just want to opt for having these replaced at a dealer.It's a five dollar job if you know what you're doing.LED CHOICES:A few things on LED lights out there.  LED lights have come a long way but by and large its hard to find an LED light that does the job these bulbs do although LEDs should last forever.  The other thing about LEDs is that they draw very little power and that can cause some problems in your vehicle.  Example, the way I knew my brake light (blinker light) was broken was that when I turned on the blinker it flashed really fast (flash flash flash flash vs flash pause flash pause flash pause)...because LEDs draw so little power, your car thinks you have a broken flash light so your blinkers could flash fast (alerting you that your blinker light is out)...some of the newer LED lights have a capacitor built in to prevent his behavior but bottom line, its hard to tell what you're getting.  I'll tell you, as soon as I find an LED light that is as bright as these bulbs, doesn't have the issues of fast flashing, and has bright lights - I will most definitely buy them primarily because LEDs should last longer than my car.  The other thing about LEDs is that they're expensive.  Bottom line, if you know what you're doing LEDs are a good option if you go find the right ones.  If you don't know your way around these newest products, go with these regular bulbsPREMIUM BULBS:In my experience they're a waste of money unless you're a car afficionado and are going for a particular look.BRIGHTNESS OF THESE BULBS:Since they were the exact same bulb that came with my car from the factory, the look is exactly the same.  Exactly the same light intensity - no more or less.  Fine by me, it's legal and bright enough.LONGEVITY OF THIS BULB:It took the set that came from the factory 5 years to burn out.  Since they're these same bulbs, I expect another 5 years from these.
I bought an emergency power fail light at a big box store several years ago.  Recently it quit working and I traced the problem to the battery.  It was a small 6V lead acid, so instead of spending $30 for a new light I bought this battery for $10 from Amazon.  With the points from my Amazon Visa card it was free!  The new one fit perfectly and the light works again.  My home will have light when the power fails thanks to Amazon!Bought this trickle charge to maintain my deep cycle battery that operates my Gate opener.  I'm very happy with this unit and plan to purchase another one to keep my motorcycle batteries up.It came with the alligator clips and a set of rings.I now have 4 Battery Tenders, this being my 2nd Battery Tender Jr.  I use the larger models for 2 cars I store each winter, and I use the Jr. models for my generator and my lawn tractor.  Easy to use and work great, I've not yet needed to replace a battery after a storage season.
This product meet all that I need it to do, this item I has a tough and rough skin. If you need to use this item for semi-full time mounted in order to charge a battery that does not always get used, this would be the right choose.I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
My screen door is metal insert and this closure kit will not work to close it without major modifications. Cannot recommend. The manufacturer could be clearer as to where and how this works because I see a lot of RVs where I live where this type of device is useless and people waste money buying it.I have to admit that there is a small  improvement in performance. The throttle response is better but not to the point to say that there is a increase in horse power. The truck seems to run a little better and I hope it's just not the change in summer fuels. I wasn't looking for fuel improvement. All I was looking for was better drivability and I think that's what I got. I only have one concern and that is that it doesn't affect the mass air flow sensor ( MAF ) because of the oil that is use on the filter could possibly damage it.This may be something that would be nice to have in your emergency pack, but it is small, toylike and not really functional as a "flare"  The light that is generated is bright in both the flash and continous shine mode, but the light is directional.  It projects basically in one direction as opposed to being a genuine flare style that projects in a 360 degree radius.  For a carry-around for emergency use it would provide some help, but I think there are better flameless flares on the market that would work better.  This is a lower cost item, so you may want to consider that when you make a comparison.  I give it three out of 5 stars but I can't recommend it to anyone who may consider this to be a complete emergency flare solution.
About a month before buying this Black and Decker unit I bought the Energizer 84020 power station for what I thought was a great Gold Box price. It wasn't. I also discovered that though I like the Energizer's design quite a bit, it's not as robust as I had hoped. And so, greedy for more power I bought the Black and Decker Electromate also.I bought both of these as emergency power sources for the next power outage. We had one this past year that lasted 8 days. No, even two of these dressed up car batteries won't help much for 8 days, but I figured that I can at least bring one to work with me every day for a recharge.I like this Black and Decker unit. It has a nice built in light for emergencies, jump start capablilities, a robust tire inflator, and plug ins for A/C and D/C. The D/C outlet should come in handy should I have to charge our Kindle Fire during an outage.We haven't had an outage yet, so I did a simulated outage to test this power source. It kept a floor lamp burning for about 8 hours, one with a fluorescent bulb but welcome light nonetheless. Before running the light test, I played with the Electromate for about an hour. It wouldn't run my electric stapler/nailer. It did power an electric drill, a television, a DVR player, a radio, and a coffee maker. Not all at the same time, of course.The inflator in the unit is excellent. The air pressure gauge is small but readable with its light and accurate. I checked it with a hand held pressure gauge.The Electromate is heavy but not prohibitively so; it's certainly not a strain to carry it about.Overall this is a nice unit, with easily understood controls. The jump start cables aren't attached to the unit, not a problem for me. Extra inflator nozzles are included but aren't attached to the unit as they are on the Energizer.One feature this unit has that is not on the Energizer and some others is the vehicle alternator voltage tester.When the weather gets nasty this winter, I plan on carrying the Black and Decker or the Energizer with me just in case.UPDATE - I've noticed that this unit doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as the Energizer. The charge on a sitting Black and Decker fades after a week or two.Very happy with this product.  I initially bought it to try and charge a dead battery, alas it wasn't able to bring the battery back from the dead, but I don't think anything could have.I've used it to restore a charge on a battery for a garden tractor (after the winter), and for a car that hadn't been driven for a couple of months.  Worked very well in both cases.  Very handy and versatile battery charger to have around the house - it charges 6v and 12v batteries, as well as standard lead-acid and high-end AGM batteries.I own a previous version of this jump starter. My was made by UST and not Wagan. The exterior is identical to my unit so I assume it is made by the same manufacturer. I normally recharge it every two months even if I have not used it to maintain a full charge for when I need to jump start a car. I forgot to charge it for about 5 months and the unit is completely dead. I have try to charge it but when you press the battery status button, you can see the voltage just keep dropping. I have try to recharge it several times and I think the battery is completely dead. The charger adapter is also dead. I measure the output voltage and it measures a little over 3 volts. I take special care of my adapters so I do not damage the wires. This unit was only used several times to add air to several tires. It has not been used to jump start. Overall very bad quality.I also have a Vector unit which is now Black and Decker and it also was not charged for 5 months. This unit still had two red lights which indicate it was in good condition. I recharge it for several hours and it came back with full power. I also own Jump and Carry JNC660 jump starter. This is a professional unit with 1700 peak amps. It can hold a charge for months and still show plenty of power. This unit is the best but expensive ($130). This unit can jump start big engines and completely dead batteries.One other general comment for those people out there assessing which jump starter to buy. These lower cost, lower peak amp starters are only good for cars that has a weak battery (i.e. as engine is slow to crank over). If your battery is dead where the engine cannot even slowly crank over, these starter will not have enough power to start your car so do not blame the jump starter as low quality. I see such comments in other reviews. For a completely dead battery, you need a more powerful jump starter such as JNC660. I have the same problem with my Vector starter which has only 300 peak amps. It also would not start a completely dead battery. That was the reason I bought the JNC660 and carry it in which ever car we own that has the oldest battery. I need to buy another jump starter (I keep one in each car) and am thinking of buying JNC300XL which claims to have 900 peak amp and is about half the price of JNC660. The reviews seem very good and is made by the same company.

The D/C outlet should come in handy should I have to charge our Kindle Fire during an outage.We haven't had an outage yet, so I did a simulated outage to test this power source. It kept a floor lamp burning for about 8 hours, one with a fluorescent bulb but welcome light nonetheless. Before running the light test, I played with the Electromate for about an hour. It wouldn't run my electric stapler/nailer. It did power an electric drill, a television, a DVR player, a radio, and a coffee maker. Not all at the same time, of course.The inflator in the unit is excellent. The air pressure gauge is small but readable with its light and accurate. I checked it with a hand held pressure gauge.The Electromate is heavy but not prohibitively so; it's certainly not a strain to carry it about.Overall this is a nice unit, with easily understood controls. The jump start cables aren't attached to the unit, not a problem for me. Extra inflator nozzles are included but aren't attached to the unit as they are on the Energizer.One feature this unit has that is not on the Energizer and some others is the vehicle alternator voltage tester.When the weather gets nasty this winter, I plan on carrying the Black and Decker or the Energizer with me just in case.UPDATE - I've noticed that this unit doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as the Energizer. The charge on a sitting Black and Decker fades after a week or two.haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceI also use mine to power my NorthStar 16 gal. yard spayer. I can spray two tanks full before the JNC runs down.
Haven't used it yet because I'm still looking for the interface to hook on my buffer wheel...I bought something for that and I'm still back to &#34;square zero&#34;...you would think that in the marketing of this sort of product the seller would fill in the gaps on the other things you need to hook everything up. Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine.I got this to do a Dynamat job on my wife's car. It was an inexpensive solution to what I needed, and did just what I expected. I am pleased. I have used it on many more projects since I have purchased it. I spotted it on the suggested scroll bar. I always check there, because there always seems to be something I didn't think about and it jogs my thought process. Good idea Amazon, thanks.I hate to admit to how long I've been a housewife...it's been awhile! I have used (like most Women) everything from ammonia to car wash soap to try to get stubborn stains, grease, dirt UP and OUT of the house.  I received this with the agreement I would review it, I would pay for this now...lol that tells you that I am impressed.  My first test for it was simple...not...I have stainless double sinks that are a nightmare to keep the crud off of, a simple spray of this and by the time I got a towel to rub and remove it, it had worked its magic. I am impressed. It has a long LONG list of what it can do, really a LONG LIST...removes paint to bird poop...I've not had the need for those to be removed yet...but give it time. The BONUS on this is 3 fold, the smell is not obnoxious and its water based and earth friendly.  I would think all women and men would love to have a bottle of this in their cleaning cupboard!
I saw mixed reviews and bought anyway.  I should have just both two of them right off the bat.  Bought the one, put it on, and it looks fine.  If I run into problems with the springs, I think there are lots of things I can do to bind it to the step.  Fits my RV step just fine.  Now I will order the second one.  If the springs hold up, that will be great because it is good to be able to take it off easily to wash the rug.Cool! Not that I really need to lock my tire chock but if the need every arises it's nice to know I can.Worked great right out of the box and I am happy with the quality.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.
Eventually.  If the O2 sensor leaves mangled threads, this will clean them up without having to pull the manifold.  Great toolEasy to use. Keeps my trailer hitch safe and secure.Has a cover over the key hole to protect from rain and dirt.I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside.
Seems to work well on lighter colored leather. Note that this leather cleaner AND conditioner both discolor plastic slightly. With that in mind, as long as you're careful the conditioner makes a leather wrapped steering wheel feel great. Also tested it on a beige leather couch, the cleaner and conditioner worked nicely.For black leather (larger surfaces than a steering wheel) the conditioner proved to be a little harder to use- it left streaks unless the entire area the product is applied to is coated pretty well.Not bad, I'd probably use it again.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.
I have one of these in each of my vehicles, either in the door pocket, center console or glove box.  I didn't mount them because having them loose in a covered compartment seemed a better idea.  I also have the key chain versions (ResQme)as a back-up in case the trapped person cannot reach the one in the door, etc.I have only had to use this device once when a Blazer flipped over on the Interstate in front of me.  The first person on the scene tried several times to break the rear window with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful.  My life-hammer did the job effortlessly with the first swing, and the seat-belt cutter quickly ripped through the belt to release the trapped driver!These should seriously be standard equipment in ALL vehicles!The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was "lost" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O. No explaination was given when I contacted the company. Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance. My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra. The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota's optional "tow package". Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long. The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way. Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal. If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake. If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good..I concur with the other reviewers that one should read the instructions well before attempting the repair.I used the repair kit to repair one 1.5 inch diameter star-burst and two small nick/chips - one of which was in driving view.I ensured the car was in the shade and cleaned out the crushed glass out of the rock impact area with the included blade. I cleaned the repair area with soap water and a glass cleaner till it was squeaky clean.I secured the repair assembly, with the 4 (good quality!) suction cups, to the windshield centering the housing over the rock impact area. I screwed in the resin delivery tube into the housing till it's rubber tip was flush with the windshield and centered to the damage area. I then added a few drops of resin (is same consistency as 3-in-1 oil) into the delivery tube and finally inserted the pressure tube which forces the resin into the crack by opening the rubber tip. I let it cure for about 10 minutes after which I placed a drop of resin on the center of the crack and placed the clear plastic sheet on it and put the windshield in direct sunlight - waited another 10 minutes and removed the plastic sheet. I scraped the excess resin with the blade.I was very happy with the results - the damaged area, filled in with the resin, was see-through, not smoky like I have seen other windshield repairs. The cracks filled to the extent that the crack was accessible. The resin could not repair a "fracture" as there is no way for the resin to reach in between the fracture. The resin did obliterate the crack lines where it did reach.The end result is that the star-burst is still there but less visible, both the nicks/chips are reduced significantly (90%+) and I can make them out only because I know where they are. The one in my driving view looks like a small pit instead of a chip. The only thing I am waiting for, this winter, is to see if the resin holds up to the heating/cooling.It took me about 1 hour to repair all three areas.The product is designed thoughtfully and is effective. The quality of materials is good. The really great thing about this product is the fact that the resin cleaned off with soap/water and did not harden on the skin. I could clean out the delivery and pressure tubes which means that they can be re-used......there is enough resin/plastic sheets left to repair a few more cracks.DON'T use more that a few drops of resin...a little goes a long way!I gave one-less star for false advertising. The company surely knows that fractures in glass cannot be repaired and should not advertise an "after" photo which shows a windshield with no hint of having been damaged.
Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern.What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.These Jumper cables are heavy Duty, Yet easy to Store. I keep them in one of my containers on my delivery vehicle. They are high quality. They are 4 gauge cable, so they are perfect and long enough to Start are Utilimaster Diesel trucks when are batteries are run Down. There are more expensive cables and even more sever duty use cables. these are perfect for this type of vehicle in an Emergency. The cost is reasonable as well. With 25 feet, you don't have to get real close to the other vehicle. you can pull up to the back and or side and just run the cables under or down the side of the vehicle.
These plugs work great on smaller tire holes. The plugs themselves are fairly expensive though and not too robust (the brass end pieces will fall off if the plug is not installed perfectly, then you start over with a new plug). I use them only when I've got a small tire hole. They say you can put multiple plugs in larger holes, but at that point you should use the larger rope type plugs.This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.So these aren't the best cables you can buy.  For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: "My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine."  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.  Remember too to clean and inspect your cables after each use to prolong their life and keep you safe.
If you travel or take vacations where you bring along bikes or have a travel trailer this inflator is the way to go. So easy to use just set the pressure you want turn it on and it stops itself. The guage is easy to read and set. My wife and daughter find it is light to carry and use.A low tire is no longer a problem and may save time by not having to change a tire until you get home or to a tire center to fix a slow leak.I use it on every wash that I do.If your a car guy and keep your vehicles nice this is a great product.If your working on a vehicle that has been abused it may take you two or three times to get the wheels looking good.You may have to scrub the wheels by hand to clean off the real dirty areas, and possibly use tar and or bug remover to get them nice and clean.But once you do that, from there in all you need to do is wash the wheels down, spray the wheel cleaner on and let it sit for a few minutes and pressure wash it off. No need to hand wash.And the wheels look really nice.it does take a little skill to make sure you dont let it land on any other surface (besides the one your trying to remove 3m from) but honestly it works great. i would recommend this glue remover to anyone who wants to remove decals from there car or remove the glue left over when removed.
Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun.First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.
this is a great product from 3m I would tell any one who is going to do painting this is one tool you should haveThis product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...
I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone.It keeps the dust and smoke out for $15. It replaced my OEM filter that had a nice carpet of dust on it from the previous owner.I use this product after i dust off my car (i do it every night because i love the paint job on my car) it cleans bird droppings and bugs from the hood without leaving any streaks.along a soft microfiber cloth this spray will keep your car looking clean
Sorry to say, I  have never used the sewer hose support as of yet.  So  I can not really say how good it is. I guess it is a great hose support if you have to use it.  Sorry, can not say how it worksNever used one of these before so and the instructions are a little confusing so I did not know how to use it. I looked up YouTube and found out how to use it and it works fine.3M knows how to make sandpaper. When you get to 2000 grit you're really polishing. I use this prior to polishing something.
This product is simple to use on single or dual piston calipers. Just put the brake pads in and screw them out. I now do not have to use bulky spreaders anymore. If it ever breaks good luck, otc is not stamped anywhere on it though.If you need to mend something and can wait a day for it to harden properly,  this is the product for you.Works for almost any material surfaces.I like this  microfiber cloth.  They have many uses around the house - for dusting and cleaning up. It works wonders on TV and computer screens. However my favorite use for them is for cleaning the car. They are slightly smaller than another set of microfiber cloths I have, and they work better for washing, applying back-to-black treatment to bumpers, and for apply car wax. I use a larger microfiber tower for drying (where slightly larger and thicker so I can use fewer towels for the job).Another great use I found by them is by sewing two of them together to form a mitt for my window washer. I have a tall SUV and cannot reach across the windshield all the way to clean it. Using the extended reach of the window wash squeegee with a microfiber towel mitt on it gives me streak free window with very little effort. Once the the mitt on the squeegee I tied to the handle with a string to keep it from sliding off. I have one mitt for washing and one mitt for drying.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  "Online Price Alert".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.
great for small engines weed eaters, ectGreat tool to have for stubborn filters. Great starting tool for a new General Service Tech. Really good for Subaru'sWork's great for my trailer.
Holding the can about 4 inches from the slide-out rubber seals, this spays an even coat of protectant over the the entire surface including the foam seals.I was expecting to have to spray on and wipe it to get the coverage.  Simple application.  My seals were thirsty for this stuff.  Hope it saves from replacing them anytime in the near future!Paired it with a black frame.  Covers the plate well and will protect it from sticker stealers...  Will see how it wears over time as it is plastic and they tend to craze over time.Better than using one of those kitchen style steps, because it will not slide out from under you when you are making a long reach. I would recommend picking up a pack of rubber bumpers (http://www.amazon.com/Waxman-4215495N-2-Inch-Bumper-Square/dp/B001WAK6E2/ref=pd_sim_indust_3 ) to prevent this from scratching your wheels.
After replacing my air lift systems in an older GMC Envoy with springs I lost the built in air compressor.  I used that accessory more than I ever thought I would.  I saw this compressor while searching for something else.  Despite its small size it performed very well.  I used it to refill a five gallon air tank that I have for filling tires in awkward locations.  This compressor was able to take the tank up to 85 psi in about four minutes.  The Envoy compressor was no better. Everything fits well in the carry bag.  The compressor seems to be very well made, and if other reviewers are still having similar experience this should be an accessory that will serve well and last a long time.Ordered this so we could do oil change jobs on our 2010 equinox.  Yes it works for the 2.4 as well as the 2.2 that its advertised for.  Does the job as intended.  Don't like the way chevy set up their filters but oh well what can you do.This filter drops right in and has carbon in the filter for filtration.  I looked up how to replace this filter online however the directions included show exactly how to replace it since it is behind the glove box.  It will only take about ten minutes.  Don't let the dealer charge you $35 for this job!
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works great on my 2006 tj. No noise from under hood seems like it will last. The belt has been on jeep for awhile now thru hot and cold weather still going strong. If you have a jeep tj 1997 thru 2006 great buy.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
I don't wash my own car very often. I usually take my car through my dealer's auto car wash... so I've had my Meguiar's Gold Class Car wash 64oz bottle for over 10 years. That's right, I've used this bottle of car wash for over 10 years.And after 10 years, the car wash is still good because I washed my car with it just a few days ago. After sitting in my garage for all this time, it still suds up, still washes very well and still smells great. I love the smell of this shampoo. The car wash hasn't gone bad, it hasn't changed color or even lost its smell.My car washing tricks are: always wash from the top down, don't dip your dirty brush into the wash bucket (rinse it first), do only 1/3 buckets at a time so you get fresh suds all the time. I used to use wheel cleaners but I this works just as well. Another reason why this has lasted so long is because you don't need a lot. I just use about an oz each time. The cleaning power of this product is great. It gets rid of all the grime and dirt, even the really dirty spots near the wheel well and around the front and rear bumpers. It rinses cleanly and easily and doesn't leave any spots. It's the perfect car wash.At the current price it's at right now it's a steal! I highly recommend it.I have had this Prestone Bug Wash in my washer fluid reservoir for a few days now and I really like it.  I recently moved to the coast of southern Georgia, where there are a lot of bugs.  I was used to a lot of bugs having lived in rural Pennsylvania and Maryland, but some of the bugs down here are...messier...for whatever reason.  I also park under trees at the house and the office, and with the higher consistent temperatures, sap has become a real issue. I have noticed already that this bug wash does a great job of getting the sap off the windshield where the typical blue stuff I had been using tended to smear or do nothing to the windshield.  This bug wash gets it all off as far as I can tell.I am ordering another bottle for my wife's minivan!Note:  I was completely out of washer fluid when I put this in, so I am using it full strength right out of the bottle.  I cannot speak to its effectiveness if it is mixed with other washer fluids or water.Update 11.11.13I have used an entire reservoir on my car since I bought the first bottle, and I am buying more to replace it.  It continues to work well in getting off the sap and the bugs.  There are some drops of sap from a large pine tree in our yard that take a few tries to get off because they are so thick, but this Prestone Bug Wash does the trick.  I did add it to my wife's minivan after my initial review, topping off her tank, which had about a 1/4 of a reservoir left of the "blue" stuff.  It works well on the van, even diluted with normal washer fluid.  I still highly recommend this washer fluid if you are dealing with tree sap.  It works on bugs too, but I've noticed it more on the sap.I love this stuff! I can't keep my car in a garage, so I use a car cover almost every day of the year. I hate going through the day long meticulous labor of washing, clay baring, and waxing my car more than a couple times a year, so I use this stuff. After washing and clay baring my car, I use the Mother's wax and throw the cover on. Each week I dust the car, and depending on the need I use this spray detailer weekly or bi-weekly. I don't know exactly what's in it, but I assume it's some sort of liquid wax. It really helps to preserve the original wax job and helps it last for months. It also cleans bird droppings, grime, and general filth gently and easily. Using it couldn't be easier. Just spray on, wipe with a microfiber cloth, and dry with another microfiber cloth. One bottle will last me two to three uses on the entire car, depending on how heavy I am with the application. An excellent product all around!
Works perfectly on engine and transmission oil drain plugs on all cars and most valve gaskets on imports.  I use this stuff any where I can on the engine to prevent leaks happening.Spray this stuff on, rinse it off, and tada you have sparkling wheels.  Works great with painted rims, not sure on how it works on other styles of rims.i used on rear brake shoe replacement.  It goes on easily without fuss or mess.  Hopefully it performs as expected.
This is a nice alternative to welding a tab on a hitch for a sway control. While I don't plan on having to move it to another hitch it is nice to know that if I had to I could. Which is something that can't be done with a weld on tab.Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.Camco must make an item for even inconceivable storage problems in your RV.  This is a perfect example of a void that probably did not need to be filled.  And actually, I couldn't find an appropriate mounting location in my travel trailer, so I gave it away.  A cheap lesson learned.
This is very handy to have around the house.  Works on any glass surface and truly makes it look invisible.  Just spray and wipe away in straight lines with a towel.  Works well on car windows too, and is safe to use on tinted windows.Originally, I purchased this for a vehicle engine air intake -- cooler air = more mpg/power.  However, I found that it works well for high temperature halogen lighting fixtures.  In the winter, CFL take too long warm up in a garage door opener.  So, I employ 150 watt halogen lamps.  Even with the translucent fixtures removed, the lamps still melt the dark plastic housing on the garage door opener.  With this heat barrier covering all of the nearby surfaces, not only is the plastic housing protected but better light out is realized.This comes with 4 rubber feet that you install on the bottom.  Each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of RV stoves.  The board itself has pre-drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove.  It's a very well-done product.  The feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove.  The finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place.  Highly recommend.
this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter.If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations, this is it. If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it. Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt. Its going to shine. Great automotive or household maintenance product.As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.
This has to be one of the best leather care products out there. I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone.In PA winter road salt causes rust on car frames - this product is a great solution. I tried Permatex because the spray-on rust sealant at the local auto parts store did not last. This product turns rust black and forms a hard protective coating that can be painted. After several months it appears to be holding up well. We are now painting over the treated frame areas with black spray paint. This also works on tools, lawn mowers, etc.Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look!
Seems to work quite well. I plan to use it every 30k to clean my Subaru's MAF. Comes with a nice little red straw so that you can precisely aim the cleaner fluid onto the MAF.I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.I used this products on numerous stains on my carpet. I followed the directions on the can and it removed all the old and new stains on my carpet. I will buy again!
I stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by. It stuck to the fabric lining and works very well.I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chockedAfter years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port, I bought this. Works exactly like it should... by being a barrier between my door and the wall. The thickness is perfect. It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs... but very good nonetheless. Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note: The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured (stucco) wall.
If your interior is already cleaned, don't use it.  It will leave lots of lint on your dash.  I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free.  So I got this from Amazon with other car care products.  I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected.  After  a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash.  So I wanted to start using this duster.  After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel.  I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should "Pick UP" dust instead of leaving "LINT"?  Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again....The tires say 300 pound capacity and maybe that is what the rubber could support on a static load but these seem to be medium duty wheels. I purchased these wheels to replace the plastic wheels on a 5 HP chipper/shredder that weighs about 100 pounds and I tow behind a lawn tractor. For my application these wheels work well. The bearings are exposed and it seems that dust, dirt and water can get into the races. The metal wheel parts seem to be thin and I do notice that both have a slight wobble in them. For medium duty applications like my chipper it is ok. I would also use these wheels on my garden wagon and 5K watt generator. I would not use these wheels on a ride on mower that had to support my weight. I would use these wheels on the front free floating deck of my ride on mower.  A grease zerk fitting would have been nice on these wheels.I always have liked Zymol products and this leather cleaner did not disappoint. I used it on the leather seats of my car and it restored the original color of them (they must have been more dirty than I thought). Will definitely buy it again.
Not only works great on car glass when used in windshield washers, but I also use it in an empty Windex spray bottle to wash all my house windows. Costs less(on Amazon)and doesn't streak like Windex.this stuff is amazing, works perfectly, Gas stays very functional all winter, in the boat, Lawn mower, and i use it in the snow blower over the summer.  fantasticoThis mitt gets used in the washing of a fleet of vehicles. So far it has stood up to heavy use and holds water and car wash soap very well.
Used on a second hand tonneau cover, restored the black back to new looking.  It took a couple of applications, but worked well.  Also effective on other trim items, not necessarily only black.  It works like a clear polish that leaves no white residue.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Seems to work well on lighter colored leather. Note that this leather cleaner AND conditioner both discolor plastic slightly. With that in mind, as long as you're careful the conditioner makes a leather wrapped steering wheel feel great. Also tested it on a beige leather couch, the cleaner and conditioner worked nicely.For black leather (larger surfaces than a steering wheel) the conditioner proved to be a little harder to use- it left streaks unless the entire area the product is applied to is coated pretty well.Not bad, I'd probably use it again.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.

I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers.Installation was super easy and straight forward. My only complaint is the clear flexible hose that comes with the kit. The hose slips on a barb fittings and it is fastened with a hose clap. The hose clamp isn't tight enough to hold back leaks with spigots that have high water pressure. This doesn't affect the performance of the product its just an annoyance. I plan on replacing the clear tube with PEX tubing that should stop all my leaks.This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess.
Fit and finish was great!!  One of the main reasons for a check engine light is a leaking gas cap seal. Replacement is easy,  pry the tether line off with a flat head screwdriver push the tether on the new gas cap back in the hole, screw the gas cap on and your done. Don't waste your money on aftermarket gas caps without a tether.This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes.

In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.Once you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it.I used this for an oil change on a 2007 Saturn Vue Hybrid. I find it odd how the GM ecotec have the oil filter canister right below the exhaust manifold. This socket fits under it without a problem allowing it to have room to unscrew the filter out of the canister. Worth the buy if you ever plan on changing the oil in your GM Ecotec vehicle! Or just to have in general in case you ever get a friend to change your oil for you!
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
Got it on and it works.  What else do you want?  Now the biggest issue comes when it is time to replace.  Let see if I can use the socket wrench to remove it.  I heard the horror stories of the piece coming off.  It doesn't look secure but i did not put the filter on tight either (which could be the problem of the other folks here that did the reviews).This was for a 2003 Honda CBR 954RR.Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires.I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).
I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.I normally use the smaller recharge kit (white bottle) but since i ran out, I bought this spray and the bigger oil can to match. I used it on a k&n filter I had never cleaned and unlike the other white bottle cleaner, it did not completely remove the oil, so it is hard to say I'm 100% satisfied. I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter. Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be, but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it won't be for a while. Since i don't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular (non synthetic) k&n filter cleaner, if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that. In this case the problem could be the filter, I have bought a few of the white recharge kits so I know how to clean filters. Time will tellIf you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me.
Solid pin. The keyhole cover slips often. I added 3 rubber o-rings to snug it up to the 2 inch hitch.I also use mine to power my NorthStar 16 gal. yard spayer. I can spray two tanks full before the JNC runs down.Used this RTV to create a gasket on an F150 differential cover. Used about 1/3 to 1/2 tube on the diff cover to ensure adequate coverage.  Applied around the bolt holes.  Begins to get tacky in about 5 minutes. Installed diff cover and finger tightened bolts, let set for approx. 1 hour.  Then tightened bolts to OEM specs.  Filled with gear oil and no leaks.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Have a Junior for my Toro Zero Turn lawn mower and two tender plusses for my Fiat Abarth and Benz AMG...they are easy to install and work great.....you can not go wrong with this product.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.
The small size of this drainer is perfect for any camper.  The little cut-out on the bottom fits over the edge of the sink.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.

Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.the nut fitting is the perfect answer to the cramped space inside the vx cruiser--way better than the OEM.  Excellent product from K&N.
work great for my John Deere X500Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.Exactly what it should be. Fits fine. Stops leakage. No way to tell how long it will hold up but it is fine now.
I purchased K&N filters for my cars and this cleaner cleans filter very well. Make sure you lay filter on top of paper towels to absorb excess oil. This will keep your MAF sensor from getting dirty with K&N OilIt filters oil and comes with the gasket and crush washer you need to change the oilSeems to work.  Have two. One in soap bucket and one for rinse bucket. Fits 5 gal bucket. Nice to throw micro wash rag in bucket and not have it sit on bottom of bucket with dirt.
It would serve it's purpose if the on/off knob was a lever or the neck was longer. I can't put it far enough into the filler tube to do any good. This may an isolated case, but it didn't work for me.If you need to change the filter on a 1984 Isuzu engine WITH THE SUPER FAT FILTER  and do not have this tool and somebody else installed the filter with more than per instructed hand tight you are without this tool in a world of hurt.Granted this too is hard to manipulate and the spring falls off  but it is cheap and it will work YOU NEED IT  NUFF SAID.My OBD2 scanner has a very short cable, so I needed something that would allow me to see the scanner while under the hood.  This works great.  Seems like it will be very durable and 5' is a good length to reach to the engine bay.
Doesn't work worth a darn.  Regular wax works better than this product.  Very disappointed with Mequiar which I thought was a good brand.  I will go back to Turtle products from now on.This is a great product, love using this....but why the huge price increase?? almost doubled?I use this product on my side windows as well, works as good as Rainex. It really make water bead really good.I really recommend this product when it was going for $5.99....currently double?? I can get it cheaper at the local stores.My last 2 orders for this product either arrived damaged (leaked all over the place) or undeliverable because it was damaged. Still waiting more than a few months for Amazon.com to address this. 2007 2008 2009 2010 i spent more than $4000 buying stuff on Amazon.com  2011....have yet to spend a penny at Amazon.com. All cuz Amazon did not want to address a $12 purchase.I used this for my german made car, works good and cheaper than the oem stuff.  an excellent product will definately buy again.
Good for filling in areas when doing custom work or doing body work to a damaged area. It's a &#34;pint can&#34; but only has 14oz in it so it was only enough for a smaller project.This is a great hose support as compared with the one I had before this. Not only does it have a carry handle that keeps it compact for storage, it has a deep enough area for the hose that the hose doesnt just slide right off the support like my old one. This one is also much stronger built and doesn't flip over on its side. Works great, easy to use, easy to store and well worth the money.This does not fit my wheels. It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations. The 100 is identical, except for the 0-60 it is 0-100, but states it has a 11" hose but it doesn't. I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.changed engine oil on my equinox. just make sure it will work on your type of car. other wise it will give you pain like one of my friends. when it works, it is super cool. not a single drop of oil on the floor.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.
The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Tight fit that is snug. A bottom fist strike seats cap. We will see soon how it handles a road trip.Not a perfect fit using the double stick tape, going to drill and screw a few holes to hold them fully secure.Not bad thought!
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!works fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.This is a great price for a replacement cabin air filter for my 2005 Toyota Corolla. It works fine and is easy to install (especially if you've done it before).
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.The lock it self looks like a quality built.

Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
This is a great quality -  made in the USA tire inflator.The ONLY problem I have found is this model does NOT have a deflate feature, the only was to lower the pressure is to raise the chuck up off the stem slightly to allow the air to leak out.Great hydraulic oil. Quality comes in an entire package. This includes the container, the pouring spout and the way the spout can be retracted with the cap on for storage. One can is enough to flush and refill the entire power steering unit.j After changing the fluid, my power steering is noticeable smoother and quieter. Very pleased with the performance of the product.The filter works very well but the real plus side on the K&N is the hex head which makes filter removal a real snap.
Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck.  I like this one.  Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality.Bought for a 2001 Maxima and it was a perfect fit. I like to keep my air cleaner really clean and this should serve my purpose well... I also bought the recharge kit which is also OEM K&N. Would recommend to anyone in the market for a K&N filter. :)This is a standard replacement for your air filter in your vehicle.  In my case, it was for my Jeep Liberty.

The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Probably a good filter but didn't fit the application. Amazon made it right, but be sure this fits your car before buying.It fits perfectly and it is inexpensive, what more do you need? Good for the do it yourself oil changer. I installed on a 2003 4Runner.
For most folks but if you need it and fail to use it really bad things will happen.I bought a Porsche where the previous owner had changed the plugs and failed to use the anti--seize and years later when it was time to change the plugs because you cannot actually see the plugs it is easier to remove the head to put repair helicoils into the aluminum as the plugs will not come out without taking the threads.  This is how the world works.  Failure to install something whre this product is needed will cost you dearly down the road. Before you begin anything with aluminum first find your bottle of anti seize so you know you can put the project back together without doing permanent damage.It fit my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71.Do this, it actually helped my car run smoother. You should have seen the jet black junk that came out of the "in" end of the filter when I dumped it out! How the filter was working, I don't know!I heard these filters are supposed to come with new hose clips, but neither of mine did on two separate orders.If you haven't done this before it can get messy with a pressurized fuel system (taking the gas cap off did little to relieve the pressure). Get a pan, rags, fire extinguisher, eye protection, and a hose to wash yourself off! It seems like the gas squirts out all over, and it does, but if you're quick enough, and wrap the hose in rags, you will have half a chance. NO OPEN FLAMES, SPARKS, HOT MUFFLERS, ETCETERA! DANGER!!! GAS, EXPLOSION, DEATH!There are clips on either end of the filter that LOOK like they come off, however, you can buy a little plastic set of "clip release" tools (Lisle 39400 Angled Disconnect Tool Set) that fit all of the clips on the car. You slide them into the hose and it spreads the clips for easy removal, and I reused mine again.Replacement for a 2006 Vespa GT200.  Shipped dry, with the acid in bottles.  You should be mechanical enough to be able to follow detailed instructions on how to remove the covers and fill the battery.  Please WEAR SAFETY GLASSES and GLOVES!  Do this OUTSIDE and have a water hose near bye &#34;just in case&#34;.... you don't want to accidentally spill or splash the acid on your skin!  Now that your scared... don't worry, it really is easy to do, just do it safely.  The last battery I bought was also a Yuasa and it was still going strong at 3 years.  I replaced it... &#34;just to be on the safe side&#34;.  Motorcycle/scooter batteries should generally be replaced every year, or 2 at the most.  I was pushing really pushing it at 3.
i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceMine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...One side goes to your propane cylinder and other side goes to your regulator.  Make sure you put some pipe dope on the 1/4"  to seal it or yellow gas tape.Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletWhile BMW claims the differential oil is a &#34;lifetime&#34; fill, replacing the oil periodically (30 to 50,000 mile intervals) will prolong the life of the drivetrain.  And the Red Line product is the best there is.
This is the only oil I've used in my Harley's for many many years.  It does what it's designed to do and it does it very well.  Great stuff.Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.easy to install, it works as expected, if you have too many release valves you can put this one at the end and use only this one instead all others
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderWorks as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.

the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob.I tried to be careful, so I enter my car information. Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit.Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad.

This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic.Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves.Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.
This is just what I was looking for,  perfect size for the spare on my 90 4runner.  Looped it through the spaces in the wheel and locked in the back.  Nice for the added security.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.
I highly reccomend this with the Meguiar's DA polisher,  perfect to use with Meguiars Ultimate Polish! But make sure you remove any contaminants from your paint beforehand!this whole kit will make your car look showroom clean this is the only brand of car cleaner i use i highly recommend it to anyoneI used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.
I purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first.Since my car is only 2 years old, I chose this Meguiar's #9 Swirl remover as I didn't want to have anything too aggressive. The paint was not in too bad a shape as I always used the 2 bucket hand wash method. Just light swirling on my grabber blue paint. To prepare the surface I washed the car then used Meguiar's clay bar to remove any embedded matter in the paint. Surprising what is in there after only 2 years even though the paint looked clean to the naked eye. After the claying I got out the Porter Cable polisher. Since this is an orbital polisher it is good for anyone who is new to using a power tool on your paint. This was my first time. It was quite simple actually. I mentally divided the hood into 5 section and did one at a time putting an X pattern on the Meguiar's polishing pad with the #9 Swirl remover. I did 4 section passes on each area and then used a microfiber towel to take off the excess polish. I could immediately see that the pad I used (Meguiar's 6.5-Inch Soft Buff Foam Polishing Pad) was just enough to do an excellent job. You see, since the paint was only 2 years old I didn't need a too aggressive polish, or a pad that cut too much. So if your car is in similar condition this may be a good combination for you. This I guess is why you do a test are first and not the whole car. After I was satisfied that this was the right combination, I moved on and finished the car. If it did not do the trick, I could use more pressure, a more aggressive pad, ramp up the speed on the polisher (I used setting 5 for this) or maybe bought a more aggressive polish. I really liked this stuff. Quite easy to do and I wasn't afraid that the polish would burn through my clear coat. I finished it up with Meguiar's liquid Ultimate Wax. The car looked when I waxed it the first time. I might try topping it off with some carnauba wax, but its not really needed.After buying this product at walmart, I quickly went home to try it out. I read the back of the bottle first for directions. While reading through the directions I have noticed it said nothing about applying it to a clean dry car. My car had a few water spots on it. I sprayed the detailer liberaly on the surface of the paint. I then used a microfiber cloth to wipe off the excess spray. After I have finished with the whole car, The car looked like it was just washed. Keep in mind that i only used about 1/5 of the bottle. This is a nice product to clean/wash your car quickly without the need of soap and water!!! It also brought extreme water beading to my car's paint!
Easiest way to apply:2x plastic spoonsSmall paper bowl or plate (do not use cups because they make it difficult to fully mix)Make sure you do not use the same spoon  for scooping out different ingredients, one spoon goes in epoxy, the other in hardener, they never touch. Scoop one on one side of the plate and one on the other. If you want you can have a small scale under plate to get perfect ratio, but I've been able to eyeball it without any problemsThis stuff is absolutely amazing for covering up exposed fiberglass on boat bottom (scrapes from beaching), old screw holes, lots of repairs where gelcoat is damaged. It should not be used for any structural repairs, use fiberglass + resin for that, this is only gelcoat/small non-structural holesIt sands very well using ultrasonic sander, hand sanding works too but takes a while. Try to get it as smooth as possible before it fully dries, I used my hand in rubber glove to smooth it out, then sand when fully cured the next dayI drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror.Lexol Vinylex Protectant SprayLexol makes a variety of quality car care products, and Vinylex is no different. I've used their leather cleaner, leather protectant, and 2-in-1 leather protectant with great success, so I had high expectations for the Vinylex.The best way to describe Vinylex is that it is almost like 303 Aerospace Protectant, which I have used for over 12 years with good success. Vinylex is a white milky liquid that is applied to plastic and rubber to protect it from UV radiation and degradation. It's not supposed to contain silicone which can dry out dash board materials.I've used the Vinylex on polycarbonate, plastic car trim, dashboards, steering wheels, center consoles, and the plastic body panels on my Ducati Monster 696. It dries cleanly leaving no greasy residue or smell. There are no streaks either. However, I don't recommend using it directly on the grip area of a steering wheel or any other surface where friction is required for safety purposes. It does get somewhat slippery even when dry.The directions indicate to shake well, so there's probably some ingredients that settle. However, I recommend covering the nozzle with a cloth when you shake it because some product does come out. I just use old (but clean) cotton socks for applying the Vinylex. The best part about Vinylex is that there seems to be no off-gassing after applying it on the dashboard. When I tried Armor All products and even 303, it tended to leave a filmy residue on the inside of the windshield as it dried out. The 303 also had an odd smell, whereas Vinylex is almost totally odor-free. I also used Vinylex on the EPDM rubber door seals on my cars.Overall: 5/5 stars, highly recommended. I feel Vinylex is better than 303 Aerospace Protectant, but only time will tell after I observe the actual UV protection capabilities.
Ease of application and removal leaving a beautiful, durable shine. I have detailed high end cars for years and this is a great product for the price. Mother's is a name to trust when you want excellent product quality. They over achieve.I chose 5 stars because of the quality of the product. It is durable and the welds are clean. I do recommend buying these Hein-Werner jack stands because they are made in the USA. The price may be high but again, would you risk your life for cheaper stands? It may also be the type of steal and materials this company uses that makes this product expensive but worth the price.This is a good starter kit for setting up a basic inverter system.  All three cables appear to be made well. The best thing about this product is the price.  You would be hard pressed making these cables yourself for the price.
This car wax is the most durable I've used, leaves a great shine and really protects against rain and the environment. The only thing that we use in small sections at a time, because if left to dry for more than 2 or 3 minutes will cost to remove. I personally let it dry for a minute as Central American climate is warm, it rains half the year, for that reason I use it because it lasts for longer during the long rains. aproximadamnete lasts 6 to 8 weeks. the mother and other brands like Meguiar not work during the winter, rain in one week both the mother and the Meguiar fail,We have a 2008 Prius and a 2005 4Runner. The Prius, with its cluster of gauges, has taught us how to drive more economically. I hoped adding the ScanGauge II to the 4Runner, a gas hog, would help reduce our gas consumption. While it is full of interesting information I'd have to say it has not helped at all with increasing our mileage. What has helped is what we learned from the Prius.I like the gauge and all of it's options. I keep it and wouldn't want to be without it because it is novel. It is very expensive though. There are cables and apps for Android and iOS that will allow you to do the same thing but with color graphics which I think might be a cheaper and better option these days.Update May 13, 2013In hindsight I realize this ScanGauge II has saved me a lot of gas money. The way it did that was showing me how very expensive it is for me to drive the 2005 Toyota 4Runner which gets between 12 mpg and 20 mpg. I sometimes have had the ScanGauge II display Cost which shows in real time what it is costing me to drive minute by minute. Consequently we leave the 4Runner parked and covered from the sun for long periods, usually about a week at a time, while we drive the Prius everywhere.It always shocks me when I fill the 4Runner and put in 15 gallons or so into the 24 gallon tank which costs me about $60 and I've only driven about 200 miles. Then I compare that to the Prius in which we regularly get about 48 mpg and put in about 6 gallons having driven about 288 miles for a cost of about $24.So in the long run this ScanGauge II has paid for itself, not by teaching me any ways to save gas while driving the 4Runner, but rather by not driving it.This wax is the ULTIMATE speed wax for the bang for the buck.  I use synwaxes primarily when the weather does not permit standing outside for prolonged periods of time such as in cold/damp weather & such because they are much easier to apply & remove.  Have compared this product to the Meguiars NXT and for 1 Mothers is cheaper, 2.) the ease of use.  I will admit though that the Meguiars product does offer more shine which is fine and all in summer months for that showcar look but here where I live in IL all I am asking for is protection in the long cold snowy salty winters and this one does the job hands down no contest!  I stock these bottles in my garage basically by the case. lol.  Don't forget to get a good carnuba wax though! I look to do that at least 3-4 times per year, but syn waxes hold up longer.  Shine & coverage = get carnuba (weather & time permitting).  length of protection/durability get syn wax.
This polish, paired with the Number 26 wax gives an incredible result.  Highly recommended for a phenomenally deep shine. Serious depthPurchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!This is the kind of spark plug gapper / gap tool you should use when gapping Iridium spark plugs. Simply wonderful.
This is the only car wash soap I use and it works good.  After over a year of using it I had a company come and detail my car and they couldn't believe my car hadn't been waxed in over a year (I do wash my car once a week). It keeps your car clean and feeling smooth.Side note - I am not saying this will replace you waxing your car.  Your car should be waxed too.I love this stuff.  I don't want to wash my car every 4 days but it gets dusty and birds use my car for target practice while I'm at work.  Just spray my car down and wipe, takes less than 5 minutes and my car looks great.  Perfect item to use between washes.  And I love the smell!  I'll be buying this stuff by the gallons!I bought this item because my hydraulic jack was leaking and I always had to top it up everytime I wanted to use it, which alone can take me 15 to 20mins to do.  With this, I just drive up and in a matter of about 2 mins I'm ready to work on my car.  It makes my DIY fluid changes and inspections MUCH easier and quicker.I have a 2005 Mazda 3, and I have absolutely no problems with it sliding, moving, or touching when I drive up on it.Although my car is not even half the weight of the 8000lb capacity model, I bought the 12000lb version just to be on the safe side.I've had this product for just under a year, and I use it every 4 - 5 weeks.  I highly recommend it if you like to save money and do your own oil changes.
I keep this in the garage for when we're going out or I'm meeting a client and don't have time to get the cars washed and waxed.I use a microfiber cloth spray generously -- it leaves the car shining and with a water repellant coating - you can see the water bead up if you get hit with rain after using it.Only pulled one star back because it can take a couple passes to get a car clean if you haven't pre-washed it (which would defeat the purpose).  If you just spray and wipe, it tends to smear alot of dust and dirt around with visible residue.Either way, at a great Amazon price, its an essential for the trunk or garage.This is a petroleum-based product with a consistency something like a thick mineral oil. Meguiar's Gold Class produces a different sort of shine than some other tire dressings. Your tires look more oiled than wet when it's first applied, fading to a more subtle but nice sheen over the course of a few days. The advantage of this product is that it will get you through a rainstorm or a washing without totally coming off. Even after the shine fades, your tires stay black for some time instead of going gray or brown. If you're looking for that super wet and glossy look, Meguiar's Gold Class will get you a good part of the way there but might not satisfy you 100%. However, if you'd like a tire dressing that improves the look of your car without requiring a new application any time it gets wet, you'll find this product very useful.And by the way, it's purple and grapey, which is irrelevant but not unwelcome.UPDATE: Reluctantly, I'm demoting my review to three stars. I've gotten a lot of use from my first bottle, with pretty good results as described above, but I don't intend to buy more because the product is too difficult and messy to use. The syrupy consistency requires more effort to achieve good coverage, especially if your radials tend to squash down a lot where they meet the ground (with my latest tires, I actually have to move the car to get full coverage). It can't be washed out of your applicator, which will eventually turn black. The black goo then spreads to your hands when you dress your tires and outlines your fingernails, making it very difficult to get your hands clean. If you wear gloves, you still have to deal with a very greasy and dirty pair of gloves. I feel I need a spray product or at least one that spreads easily. I don't mind if it doesn't last as long as Endurance High Gloss, as long as I can reapply it without all the effort and mess.This is my go-to wax for 2 of my cars.  In essence, it is &#34;oily&#34; or at least it leaves the car looking wet.  Take note however that on a black car, this wax will actually attract dust.  It does look excellent for a few days but then I notice how the general dust seems to get settled more easily.  I use another Meguiar&#8217;s product for my black car now.  On my red and blue vehicles I stick to this wax.  Elbow grease comments?  Yeah only if you have done NO prep work on the vehicle before application.Couple things to upgrade any good detail job (I&#8217;m referring to the one and two star folks)&#8212;washing, drying, and throwing wax on a car will never bring out a showroom shine unless the car is new.  Washing, drying, and prepping the entire vehicle with a product like Meg&#8217;s fine-cut and in some cases medium cut cleaner is the ticket.  You can take out so so soooo many scratches, swirls, and debris that way.  Stay clear of &#8220;rubbing compound&#8221;&#8212;better yet leave it in the 80&#8217;s.  After you have used fine cut and the car almost looks polished already (remember you need to use a variable speed polisher&#8212;you cannot use this stuff with elbow grease), go over it with your clay bar just to make sure.  The vehicle should be smooth&#8212;no bumps, pits, etc.  If so, start with the fine-cut again and level it out.  Understand the Medium-cut, Fine-cut, and Rubbing Compound are all abrasives.  Think liquid sand paper with Rubbing Compound being the harshest next to actual sand paper.  Finally go ahead and use the wax.  Only apply it to small areas and then wipe right off with a microfiber towel.  I literately give the area 30 seconds to a minute to dry.  DO NOT wait for the wax to dry.  Follow the directions and don&#8217;t apply so much that you can&#8217;t get it off before it dries.Use only microfiber towels&#8212;don&#8217;t fool yourself with anything else.  Never ever ever ever apply wax in the sun.  Do it under cover, in a garage, or in the morning/evening only.  Hot car means hot sticky dry wax---check the metal and see if it&#8217;s too warm.
I stuck one the tongue of the rv and its off, when i compare it to my larger one.  I would not advise to stick it to the trailer.  Very difficult to pull off.My Dodge Intrepid 2001 started having a leak around the transmission....my mechinic told me to try Lucas a long time ago. But I didn't since I was worried it would make my car worse or wouldn't work. So one day I decided what the hell it wouldn't hurt to try. I received the item it's thick and slow to pour in the transmission small diameter fill tube.But overall it improved the shifting characteristics immediately. I have put about three hundred miles on it and shifting is perfect. No more hesitant shifting from gear to gear or lugging or clunking when down shifting to first gear.I've got a sport bike that doesn't have any storage.Before, I had a smaller disc lock made by someone else, but the internals on it always locked up - even when I had the key.So, I got this one, wanting something better.This one is too big to mount in the little spot I had before.It came with a little nylon carry bag, and I tried mounting that to the motorcycle, but it didn't stay. I took it off before it fell off and I lost the lock.Now, if I plan to go somewhere that I want to lock up the motorcycle (Wal-Mart or some sketchy bar), I will tuck this into the pocket of my riding jacket if I remember it. The problem is, I have never remember it.I've never gotten any use out of it, yet there it sits: Brand new and never flawed.
I used this products on numerous stains on my carpet. I followed the directions on the can and it removed all the old and new stains on my carpet. I will buy again!If your interior is already cleaned, don't use it.  It will leave lots of lint on your dash.  I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free.  So I got this from Amazon with other car care products.  I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected.  After  a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash.  So I wanted to start using this duster.  After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel.  I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should "Pick UP" dust instead of leaving "LINT"?  Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again....I always have liked Zymol products and this leather cleaner did not disappoint. I used it on the leather seats of my car and it restored the original color of them (they must have been more dirty than I thought). Will definitely buy it again.
I have always used this filter on my multiple different motorcycles and never had any issues. Great oil filter! Thank you!I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.It's the second time, I've used this product on my Mitsubishi Eclipse v6 5sp. I highly recommend it for everyone to use it.
this is a good durable product for you travel trailer. if your having some trouble getting on or off your hitch this will offer a little more height in doing so.If you need a 50 foot white hose, this is a good choice.  I have several lengths of hoses, but sometimes you just need a longer hose.  Nice quality, does the job.This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.
First things first...any protection this offers is purely incidental. You are fastening a metal grid to a plastic lens. Duh. But from a style standpoint, it does dress up the tail light assembly. One bar does pass right in front of theback up light which does diminsh its function. Installation is very simple. Directions are clear. The item is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the paint job good. It is a simple way to dress up your ride.While this is a simply plastic funnel, its uses are allot. My biggest use is with  power equipment like my riding lawnmower; the oil cap is near the bottom and a difficult place to fill. The funnel is perfect also for smaller engines like my Pressure Washer - etc. Hope this helps.The filter works very well but the real plus side on the K&N is the hex head which makes filter removal a real snap.
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.Precise sizes since they weren't listed in any description: .045 .080 .050 .040 .060 .044I used to gap 4 NGK Iridium IX spark plugs. The tool's metal didn't bend. Would buy again.Came in the original box, no damage, no issues. Great price, way cheaper than any store around me. Runs really well in my car.No cons
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.3M knows how to make sandpaper. When you get to 2000 grit you're really polishing. I use this prior to polishing something.How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL
As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.Well, it does what it was designed for. I haven't noticed any difference in durability between the original one that came from the dealership (but it's sure is cheaper to replace it yourself ;-) ). Good product. Changing it was a breeze.This is a must if you use the Moroso tire gauge. I do not know why it is sold separately. It should come pre fitted to the gauge. I'm sure no one will complain given the fact that it protects the gauge against knocks, even if it added a few bucks to the gauge, which is not cheap in the first place.
I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job, returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter, good to go!After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation
Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows.If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.
Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.It does just what it says.  Software will give you the exact manufacturer's fault read-out.  It's still up to you to find the exact cause, but this item provides the fault read-out at a bargain price.  Mine just paid for itself: the dealer charges as much to read the code as this scanner costs!  $29 more everywhere else!Just what it is - brass drain plug.  Normal quality as you would buy in a hardware store if you could find this configuration for this specific purpose.
Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLAlways make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!
Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position.Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased.Every person that changes their own oil needs one of these. It is a perfect fit.Simply attach a 15/16 socket to your torque wrench, attach this filter to the socket, and the rest is just as easy as can be. Perfect
This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.Campground water is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get.  We filter the water going into the trailer and play it safe.  This filter works very well.This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast.
I bought two 5 gallon buckets from Home Depot for only about $3 each and these fit into the buckets perfectly.Tip: use the grit guard insert to mix the water and soapI have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.This tender answers a problem that I have had for several years. How to charge more than one battery at a time with only 1 outlet available for use in my garage.Works great and I really like the plug in adapters. They are the standard SAE type plug. This charger simply plugged into my bikes, since I have been using these adapters all along. (This charger comes with 2 adapters that have eyes that you hook up directly to your battery post screws/bolts, and 2 alligator clips that simply clip on to the battery posts. Both styles are fuse protected with a standard 7.5A ATO bladed fuse).
As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do.I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.I put my sports car to bed in the winter, battery would be dead with out this charger.  Needed an extension to reach the car
Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too.Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern.This is a great replacement bolt kit for your License plate mounts.  I personally did not need the grommets but the bolts were exactly what i needed.  Only negative is that the key for the bolts should have been grooved on both ends, as the groove is only on the tip of the long end leaving you to struggle with the short end of the key when the bolt gets really tight.  Advise using something like a Ratchet extender on it....
No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.These are fairly solid lead cables. The cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair, where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead, each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap USB cable.The banana clips are normal/common, the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part, i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard, these are solid. Additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable, i think it will hold up very well and not break lose.The alligator clip ends seem to be just fine. contrary to others results i have 2 pairs and the alligator ends are just fine, teeth all line up fine. the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close. clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersOverall:Really wish they were combined leads not 2 separate wires and thicker gaugeGood cables, and i would still recommend them** If this review helped you please click the button below **Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.
I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway.Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good LuckIf you need extra room for storing this, then is perfect for you; ball sizes range from 1 7/8 to 2 1/2" and change very easily with little effort.  This model requires a slight turn of the center pin to lock/unlock the ball for changing and you need to remember to re-lock it after attachment.
These are almost identical to the ones I've rented from Autozone in the past.  I decided to get my own set for sheer convenience.  The work well for the passenger cars--don't know about any other type of coil springs.  Can be tricky on progressive springs with lots of coils on the ends. because you need to have room in between coils for these to fit.  Also, it should be obvious but these are to be applied on coils only.  Attaching one end to the strut mounts or top cap is a recipe for disaster.I underestimate the size of this level (although it was stated in the specs): I was expecting a small bulls-eye level, around 1" in diameter. This thing is 4 times the size! But regardless, it works as it is supposed to. I've contemplated mounting it to our travel trailer via the screw-holes or double sided tape but haven't just yet. I want to make sure the thing will hold up to some weathered-use before I drill holes into a metal component. Not bad for &lt;$4 (at the time of this review).Lots of glowing praise on this item and while I agree with most of the comments like great leverage, good in tight spaces, easily adjustable, long reach... and so on... it failed me miserably on the first use. I had a filter that was not "hand tight" as many expect them to be when they're ready to slide under and twist them off with just a light touch of pressure. The filter on my 1999 Expedition is right behind the bumper so I'm not sure if that placement exposes it more to the elements and makes removal more difficult or if the filter was last replaced and tightened way too much... last change was by a Ford dealer because it was a freebie. I clamped onto the top of the filter and it immediately punched holes into it with the claws that are suppose to grip the filter... and then came the oil down my arm. I tried again at the base of the filter where there's a little more metal and immediately got another set of holes. I went for the strap wrench but that wouldn't budge it either. I finally got it off with my KR Tools 12153 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliers. I know all filters aren't difficult to remove but I've been changing my oil & filters... plus most repairs... for about 50 years and this is not the only filter I have had problems removing. I will be purchasing a cap type filter wrench and have given this wrench 1-star because I could not get the filter off with it and it punched holes in the filter... and since this tool is pretty much useless for any other job it'll likely be donated or just sink to the bottom of my auto tool drawer. I don't care about the holes as much as I did the resultant oil leak or the potential that the filter may have to be removed in pieces. I'm also surprised that one reviewer talks about holes and how this wrench didn't cause any in the removal or install... and I think anyone who tightens a filter with a wrench is asking for problems. I have purchased quite a few TEKTON tools on Amazon from wrenches to sockets and have not been disappointed... until now. Lastly, if your filter is on tight you should be able to exert enough pressure with a tool to get it off without punching holes in it.Since I was able to get it off with the pliersKR Tools 12153 Pro Series 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliersthat would seem to be the better tool investment if you have a large filter... at least the jaws have more teeth for a better grip, the teeth are not likely to puncture the filter, it has a lot more potential for other uses where an oil wrench does not and the price is about the same. I have used the pliers on many other things without an issue or damage to what I was working on... especially good for my 1-1/2" PVC irrigation and pump lines.
Solidly built. Doesn't destroy the grease cup.  Adjusts to two heights.  Presses out the pin without damaging the threads (as long as the nut is only backed off so the top of the nut is the same level as the top of the threads) and is built to last. Works on the ball joints and tie rod ends. Mechanic quoted me $350 to replace tie rod ends and tie rod inners on 03 diamante.  That is a very good price for parts and labor.  Through Amazon I bought this tool and the $20 smooth inner tie rod remover (looks like a muffler clamp with a 3/8 inch square insert)  Two moog tie rods for $30 each and two ends for $20 each . (parts could have been cheaper but I like Moog)  With this tool and the inner tool the job took only 1 hour for both.  So I saved $200 and still have the tools.  Not bad.  What more can you ask for.  Next project is replacing the 9 ball joints on my 65 FJ40.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.
2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.Does the job it says it does.  I connected the quick-connect to my battery in my 2004 Honda Civic LX.  I poked the quick-connect through my hood so I don't have to raise my hood every time I want to change the battery.  I pull in the garage (after driving) and connect the battery charger with the quick-connect.  I let it charge all the time.  I rarely drive; so it helps keep the battery charged.
Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.This is put together well. Not sure why I would need it but just in case I want to run an inverter off of a 12 vdc battery then I can
Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too.For occasional use, this is a perfectly-sized tube.  If you need this for a shop, look for larger packages.Does what it needs to do.  Simple to apply, evenly and lightly coat the threads, and works well.This inexpensive funnel is pretty handy for certain jobs.  I use mine for fuel additives such as Seafoam, which is a good product but the container is difficult to pour into most car/truck fuel tanks.  A nice little funnel for the price.
These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.
it works, but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size, as it takes 2x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience, which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard.A bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way.  It's manageable to lock and unlock, but you have to do it at a slight angle and/or wiggle it in.  The black makes it look hidden and matches nice.Larger than I expected and solid feel like. The only cons is the curve is not snapped under wheel smoothly and there is a gap between curved surface and wheel line. So I do not know if it is really working or not because the function of chock is for the accidental circumstances the car slipped back,however, it is not usually happened when the car is put on the parking gear and hand brake is applied.  So hard to say it's good or working, unless the car is really accidentally slipped back and blocked by this wheel chock.  Then you can finally see if the chock is good or not.  But anyway,  it worths that money.
Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wiresThese scrapers always break at the smallest part of the handle right behind the head. I heated up a length of 3/4 PVC conduit and slid it over the entire handle,allowing it to spread out slightly at the scraper head. Works like a charm, and now it's long enough to reach the center of my truck windshield!If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
I have a bunch of these in various models, 6v, 12v, and this one the multi-mode 12v. They really do a good job.Reasons I don't give a 5 star:I have had 3 of them go belly up. One the company replaced free, I have not bothered on the other two yet.The supplied "hard wired" harness has a inappropriately short cord before the connector.(Edit: the hardwired lugs to attach to the battery are also not appropriate many cars especially older ones as the hole is about right for a motorcycle battery. Making my own harnesses for making the unit hard-wired to the battery was a bit time consuming but they turn out well, just FYI don't expect to just bolt it on your standard battery clamp. Its way too small. The cig lighter, if your car has a permanently connected one is probably easier but new cars sometimes control this with key. Oh, two more comments - 1. It doesn't' come with a cig lighter attachment, its optional and 2. the optional hard wire hookup DOES have larger lugs on it)If you are wiring into a motorcycle it might just be long enough, but for my car applications I have always had to make my own harness extensions which is time consuming to get the wires all soldered, shrink wrapped.It does come with a nice little case.Having separate small battery mode and AGM mode is nice, although the paperwork on the basic ones mentioned they would charge AGM. AGM just takes a slower charge rate than lead/acid apparently as it heats up. I am not sure what they claim the AGM mode is, but nice to have it.I'm using this to secure the spare tire on my utility trailer. It has a nice thick cable and it's not too long like a bicycle cable lock. Tubular locks are not my favorite, but overall this device seems like a pretty good deterrent for the casual thief. I did notice that the ring on one end of the cable was drilled out way off center. Maybe not the best quality control? (See it in the pic I posted.) I'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend it without hesitation.The size is deceiving. I got this for my dad who was kind of used to those heavy metal-cased chargers that need special care not to destroy the battery. The nice thing about these CTEK chargers are that they are &#34;smart&#34; and require no special treatment. It really is idiot proof: just plug and play.And I can attest to the &#34;reconditioning&#34; feature. It will NOT resurrect a totally dead battery, but if you have an old battery that's marginal (meaning it is borderline: may or may not start your car/tractor/whatever), it will make it better! We tested this on a marginal tractor battery. It only started if it felt like it before, but after reconditioning it was significantly better.The only feature I wish it had was a &#34;boost&#34; feature. But any charger with a useful boost feature of any use has to be a really large one so it would be impossible to fit that feature in this form factor. A spare battery is better than any &#34;boost&#34; feature anyways. You'd be better off keeping a spare battery sitting around to jump start your vehicles. I kept my old car battery, reconditioned it and leave it charged in my garage for that purpose.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.
The Amazon fitment guide said this would fit my 2004 Chevrolet Silverado LS, 5.8L V8.  It DID screw into the tank opening but after about five minutes of driving, I got a &#34;tighten fuel cap&#34; warning on my truck computer.  This cap can only be tightened so tight before it starts to &#34;click.&#34; It turns out that my truck has a cap that does not have threads on it like this model has.  Look closely at your factory gas cap.  If it doesn' have threads and has a geometrical triangle pattern on the side of it, skip this cap.  I ended up getting an ACDelco, GT264 cap from Amazon and it works just like the factory cap.  The Amazon picture for the GT264 does not show a side view of the cap, but all you have to do is Google the model number and there are hundreds of pictures on the internet.  I commend Amazon for their great shipping and return policy.  I will NEVER take them for granted.  I am a true LIFETIME Amazon customer.I have a Honda VTX 1300. I put hard bags and a trunk on the bike. I love that these covers come in sizes! Fitting the bike hasn't been easy. I got the XXL and it is nice and roomy and covers easy.  LOVE IT.  It has good elastic around the bottom that holds it nicely but I do have footboards that help hold it down as well.  If there is a storm coming I will not use the bungee that goes under the bike and hooks on the other side. I have had it blow off the bike other wise but that is a heck of a storm when it does that! For the most part that isn't necessary.  It does have the heat reflectors for the pikes but I wait for the bike to cook down before putting the cover on anyway.I haven't found it cheaper anyplace and having this size option is great! Takes the trial and error out of buying a cover!I have had it for a while now. I like it. There is a little space between the holder and the wall to which I have mounted it. Mounting is pretty easy as there is plenty of space to fit the screw driver. I would say that it holds 20 to 25 grocery bags.
Again, these guys are hard to do without.  They are doing the job!  I don't buy the 3-pack, I prefer to buy the individuals in quantities of 3 because, for some reason, I get free shipping on the individual ones, but not on the multi pack one.  So, it came out cheaper to buy them a la carte.  Go Figure!Go ahead and price out some fuses at the local big box stores or auto parts.  For just a few you would pay $5 to $10.  You get 150 for that here.  For most people, you would never have to buy fuses again.  I'm a mechanic and electrical is my specialty.  I have equipment, knowledge and experience that keeps me from using a bunch of fuses.  However, unit come in all of the time missing and or have multiple blown fuses, so I do go through a lot of them.  These fuses work just fine.dont buy this product, I  bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing, the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn, waste of money. at least amazon let me return it broken.
Yes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine.Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage, from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges. I need to buy another pack though, for the back doors protection too, as it is not long enough for both doors. We don't need it for the back doors very often, but I think it will come in handy at times. Since we like this so much, we will be buying another.The provided foam spacers and fit was perfect on my 2013 JEEP OEM hitch receiver.  Sturdy and well made.  The one I received had round corners so I did not have to 'modify' it as some other's stated they had to do.  I will not leave this permanently in my hitch and the weather, since there is potential for moisture to get into it.  If you put keys in this I'd suggest a zip log bag.  There are two holes in the back of the unit which I suspect is to allow moisture to escape, I thought about using Silicone RTV to close those up, but decided against it.  Weather, and especially near coastal areas, will probably corrode the combo lock at some point so I will not leave it permanently installed, and will keep in my cab until I need it.Looks like your standard tire plug. I keep this in my trunk in case I ever get a &#34;good&#34; flat so I won't have to solely rely on the donut spare that came with the car.

Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date.I'm using these in my 2009 Civic sedan and have not had any problems. Fits like a glove and build is solid.Because the original rain gutters were so small and out dated the extension you could buy on the market just didn't fit at all. Instead of opting for extensions we bought these and installed them. I am glad I did! Installation was a breeze and the instructions were more than sufficient. As long as your RV is level you should have no problems with drainage.

Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThese will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.I have used these belts on every vehicle I own and will never use another!  Quiet, rigid and priced right!

Good product.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Works ok, but is smaller size than the blue  ones offered here on Amazon. Due to the size difference the Blue ones are a much better value.

One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.
I haven't driven on these yet. I'm sure they will work fine once I do. They seem pretty well made (in China) and from the reviews will give me the traction I need.I have mounted the non-defective one on a wheel and installation is as easy as they say. The chains are coated in some kind of material that gets all over your hands, which is why they give you gloves I suppose. But, the gloves are too flimsy to last; keep a pair of cheap work gloves in the container.The rubber tensioner is probably the most difficult part of the installation; it takes some strength, particularly in the wrists, to stretch it enough the last 2 clips. But, it makes for a very snug secure installation.The reason for the 3 stars is that one of the two 'chains' had a cable twisted around itself, rendering it useless. I'll have to send it back.Advice to anyone who buys these things (or any chains); put them on the vehicle as soon as you get them and well before you will need them. They may be defective, as mine were.But also, you don't want to be figuring out how they are supposed to be mounted when you're hip-deep in snow or stuck on the side of a road with other vehicles slip-sliding your way.The plastic container has finicky hinges and clasp; a different model of this chain comes in a bag instead of a plastic box; you may want to consider getting that one instead.Aligator clips make the battery tender MUCH more versatile.Not many batteries are able to accomodate the "2 pin plug"& this is quite dissapointing when it arrives,and it is not ready to use w/o clips.Actually Battery Tender should INCLUDE,or at least make the buyer aware that these clips are most often a must.It would be advisable for them to include this assembly,even if the price goes up  5 dollars,it is well worth getting the full compliment of accessories to get a completely functional unit. Saves time and shipping.Amazon does list these as a"most often purchased with"accessory,but it is quite essential&most people are unaware of this.On the plus side,it is a a great product,once you can use it!There are plenty of RV Park type campgrounds out there.  However I like the scenic view and smells of a wooded campground.  There's just one problem with these.  In my area of the country, these are usually built on a ridge and the pads aren't always as level as they could be.  For owners of most larger rigs, you know well that the stablizer jacks have NO ability to level a trailer that isn't level.  Enter the Camco Tri-Levelers.  Back your trailer into within 18" of your intended final stopping point on the pad.  Lay a pair of these right behind the rear tires of the trailer, making sure their parallel with the tires.  Back up until you've achived your desired height.  On asphalt these will not move.  Then use a pair of standard chalks to chalk the front tires.  After that, your set, drop your trailer and set it up.Why do you need them?  Of course, camp long enough and you'll see everything from people driving their trailers onto 2x8s to slabs of concrete.  These are MUCH safer, will not rot, will not slide, and will not crack.  They are study and made of think ridged plastic.  Each one I would say weighs about 5 lbs so they'll still be lighter than anything else you carry.  And they will last forever!  You could safely leave these under your rig for years without worrying about damage from weather or sunlight.Why not 5 stars?  Three reasons...  1) It's not safe to use these on your own without a spotter.  An experienced RVer can back his rig onto a pad with no assistance.  However with these it's just not safe.  You could easily back off the back edge since the rear lip is no taller than the ones to each tier of leveling.  2) These are only suitable you rearward sloping pads with minimal side-to-side slope.  Due to the face that these are only 18" long they cannot level a tandem axel trailer from side to side as both axels will not touch the leveler.  And they are too long to fit a second Tri-leveler under the front tire for standard trailers.  Though side-to side leveling would be possible for single axel trailers.  3) Final placement is important as it could damage your tires (especially if being left for a season.)  When I use them and the trialer is still hiched it pinches the tire.  After leveling this seems to go away.  But if it didn't and you were concerned for your tires, this would mean rehitching and adjusting.  Each level is only about 5" long by approximately 9" wide.  So tire contact can be an issue.  For more agressive slopes, my recommendation after using them a couple of times.  Drive you rig onto them until the rear of the chock (whichever level your using) is pinching your tire.  And making sure you don't drive off the back!  Then when you let the tongue down it will stop pinching and sould be just right.Final thoughts...  These levelers are purpose built for the most common type of leveling.  They do very well at that.  They don't do well with other types of leveling.  Though I suppose you could use them with a foward slope as well if you were creative with your tongue jack.  If it seems like I'm being critical of them, I'm just trying to give an honest review.  I do think they are a great, well built product that is worth owning if you enocounter this type of issue with your trailer.  If you have issues with side-to-side leveling, there are other products out there that will suit you better as well as cost you more.  Personally I own both since I never know what type of situation to expect.  I like the simple design.  No assemlby means they're easy to move.  Unless the situation requires it I will always grab these first for just that reason.  One final thing to consider.  Anytime you raise a tire or pair of tires on your trailer you're obviously going to have a more significant rise on the end of your trailer.  Make sure your carrying something to let you sill use your stablizing jacks.
Nice little horn for my Harley. LOUD enough to get people to move when they pull out in front of you and decide to go slow, small enough to fit, and nice to look at.Got asked asked a bike meet just the other day "what is that" and he sure got a surprise when I pushed the button lol. This model is completely chrome to look at when installed,  unlike other types that a partially chromed.To use this on a motorcycle you will need to install the included relay for the main power to the horn to prevent damage to your wiring. If I needed to I would definitely buy this horn again, in the first week it has already scared two cagers out of my way that have cut me off by running red lights, who knows it may have even saved my life.I am glad I bought it, but unfortunately due to Amazon raising prices as I put items in my cart it will probably be my last purchase from them. I mean really, I put a $225 item in my cart but when I go to pay for it it goes UP $75? That is just insane.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.I have a 2008, Ford F150 FX2 Sport, Supercab. I had never done anything with sound, to any vehicle I had ever owned, that was so extensive. I am so glad I did. I absolutely love this stuff and will probably put it in any vehicle I own, whether I do a sound system or not. It just quiets things down. It gets a bit sticky at times but comes right off your fingers. Be careful with small pieces that you want to throw away, they may end up back on the bottom of your foot. It took me a solid weekend to do the front to the back and doors. If you have the time, do it.
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.I've not used this yet. I hope I never need to, actually. If I do, I will certainly update this review. :)Before purchasing this item I called the manufacturer to be sure it did what I wanted.  They said it would but it did not.  i called them back and they said it was capable of what I wanted but I would have to program it for it to work.  Not what you read on the package, not what the manufacturer said, and directions so poor I could not beging to program it and I'm a geek.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RVThese worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile.
This would be a great idea if it actually wasn't too tall to fit inside our camper cabinets.  I measured this before ordering and thought it would fit.  But you really can't judge how your knives will fit in it from the description.  Most of our knives were too thick at the handle or too wide at the blade to sit down inside it fully.  Therefore they would stick up too high and would prevent the cabinet door from closing.  It was a waste and I didn't use it.I recommend instead buying a full knife set with holder and overall product dimensions, and doing some thoughtful measuring.Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad.Very useful charger. I mounted it in the engine bay near the battery and it works as intended.Only downside to this charger is the length of the plug cord. It worked well for my application though because i mounted it in tandem with a flush-mount sealed power port on the side of the vehicle.It allowed my battery to remain topped up and warm enough to start at 35 below zero like it was no big deal.I will be ordering a second for an other vehicle.

Install is pretty straight forward.My buddy has one and i use it when i have to do an emergency break job on one of my old cars. So now since i have aftermarket rims that require a thin wall socket.... I used it as a excuse to buy this. Its a great little breaker bar to keep around for when you need to change tires.I have one Battery Tender Plus and love it, No problems with it. Works Great on the quads and motorcycle, Also put it on my electric start generator. I make a habit of every month to swap it from one unit to the other for a couple of days.Till fully charged. All batteries keep at full charge. Also put it on my pick up and jeep when i don't drive them much.Also i charge the battery in the trailer. I guess i am to cheap to buy another. But this way i look at the batteries and check.The pick up and Jeep and trailer have big batteries and take a little longer to fully charge. Great unit.A must have and AMAZON has a great price.
does the job.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckIt fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.
I had a leaking gray tank valve so I purchased this to add an extra layer of protection.  Now I can hook up my hose and pull this one first and than the Black tank and gray tank in that order.Looks like your standard tire plug. I keep this in my trunk in case I ever get a &#34;good&#34; flat so I won't have to solely rely on the donut spare that came with the car.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer.

Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.This seems to be one of the better levelers.

I saw a review on Mojo channel where the reviewer used the MPG display to increase mileage.Based on this I bought one and I'm not disappointed.I can see this easily paying for itself in less than a year.The real time MPG display allows you to tame that lead foot and get awesome mileage on a long run.I did an 8 hour drive last week and must have got conservatively 5MPG better fuel economy. You do have to work at viewing the display and feeding it back to that right foot. Very easy to install - under 5 minutes.If you're not a gadget fan then don't buy it.No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.Well to start, this unit seemed well built. Has a little weight to it so I think its built good. I only used it once because it has one poor design issue. "IT DONT LIGHT UP"..no lighted led screen monitor? Like doin a etch a scetch in the old days. lol...All fairness they left it out so you would buy the higher models I guess. Strange part is most of the cheap readers this company makes seem to have lighted displays.I live in an area were its dark at 5pm in the colder part of the yr. I need light. If you dont have sight issues or if you dont care if you have to hold a flash light while looking at codes then go for it...I returned it and bought the 1403. It does more anyway. If you do get the upper models be prepared to get a RS232 to USB adapter plug for them. Not sure why these are not updated to USB? Hope this helps...most people dont seem to care about the light but it makes such a big difference.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderbought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.Exactly what it does. Designed to be light weight, affordable, and reliable. Except that it should only be used in emergency situations. Situations where you walk out of a store to realize your car wont start. This will have enough power to jump start these kind of scenarios. It WILL NOT jump start a car thats been sitting for a month and the battery has been drained to nothing. Its not designed to do that. The light in the front is useless and isnt even LED, BUT it doubles as a cigarette lighter type 12v socket to charge up a phone or whatever. Dont lose the charger, it costs half the price of the actual jump box and is a very non standard voltage.Would give it 5 stars, if it had a more standard 2 prong or 3 prong standard wall outlet plug for charging. but overall. its good to have in the trunk for those just in case moments.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!

The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.

This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.

If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.First, this is a great unit and rock solid at brake control.  I upgraded from a Tekonsha Prodigy.  It's Simple!  Just removed the older unit (Prodigy) from it's existing bracket, unplugged the existing wiring plug, plugged in the P-3.  I slid the P-3 into the old bracket and inserted the 2 screws.  It's installed.Then I just adjusted the P-3 per the included operating instructions. It could not have been simpler.Starting from scratch?  About an hours work and the instructions are all there.  Most newer trucks come with a trailer harness for a controller.  My 06 Chev 2500HD did.  However there are instructions for installing it without a dealer supplied harness as well.Highly recommend this unit vs. others if mounted at eye level.  (see "Update Aiain).Update:  This is a great unit.  BUT, other than an LCD screen to provide additional info for the user, the ability to control the braking action is no better/ no worse than the Prodigy I replaced.Update again:  The LCD screen is impossible to read if the unit is mounted low on the dashboard area and/or if you wearing polarized sun glasses.  I switched back to the LED unit which is far easier to see and read.DOWNGRADED TO 4 Stars!
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.
These tools paid for them selves with the first use. Good quality but stick to cars and small trucks or you might have problems. Wish I had them when I rebuilt the front end of my Chevy S-10. I will never touch a pickel fork again!At the time when I bought this I only had once motorcycle. Now I have two and with I bought the one with multiple ends. I would recomend to anyone who want to keep a battery on standby and not be dead when you go to try to start it.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.
These are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.Not much to say about these as they aren't really an exciting product, but they are good constuction, they stack nicely when not in use to save space, and they are cheap.  They do the job.Where have these been in the past? These wipers really need great reviews because they belong in an exclusive class far and above all others. They look deceivingly fragile and simple but the truth is they are designed for one task where they excel. They should be called Gliders not Wipers for they remove snow, debris and water without a sound and amazingly remain in contact with the glass throughout their paths.They have remained in good condition for me far longer than others. I do like the fact their ultra low profile makes no wind noise at speeds plus they look very sleek.In short they are worth the extra cost many times over. Give these a try, you will never go back!
TIRE TREAD DEPTH GAUGE, IT WORKS, I NOW KNOW I WILL NEED TIRES A LITTLE SOONER THAN I THOUGHT, A GOOD BUY IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN PEACE OF MIND =)Mothers 05500 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Paste - 12 ozI HAVE A LOT OF BOTTLES AND CANS OF WAX AROUND THE GARAGE. After using this last weekend on my 69 I am tossing out all the other stuff and sticking to this product. My truck looks so sweet and silky smooth I am sold.***DOES NOT COME WITH APPLICATOR PAD***Buy with confidence.RagenRatA dollar? I stole this. hehehee
These Jumper cables are heavy Duty, Yet easy to Store. I keep them in one of my containers on my delivery vehicle. They are high quality. They are 4 gauge cable, so they are perfect and long enough to Start are Utilimaster Diesel trucks when are batteries are run Down. There are more expensive cables and even more sever duty use cables. these are perfect for this type of vehicle in an Emergency. The cost is reasonable as well. With 25 feet, you don't have to get real close to the other vehicle. you can pull up to the back and or side and just run the cables under or down the side of the vehicle.please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesLow price, can get one for each of my 3 vehicles...the stock wrench that came with the cars are too short....when you need it, it will be worth it.
I picked this up as a Lighting Deal and it has not disappointed. Great digital gauge if that is what you are looking for in a tire gauge.Well....It's a good ball.  It's a shiny ball.  Exactly what it's supposed to be.  Pulls a trailer.  Very tough.  Thanks.The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.

This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!

I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.
BOUGHT THIS FOR A REPLACEMENT TO THE OLD WHITE TANK COVER ON MY 31' COUGAR CAMPER. GREAT COLOR BUT NOT BRONZE, MORE OF A MEDIUM BROWN. I LIKE THE ACCESS ON TOP FOR THE VALVES. THE ONLY REASON FOR 4 STARS IS THE FACT THAT IT IS A 2 PIECE BOLT TOGETHER DESIGN. WOULD HAVE RATHER IT BEEN ALL 1 MOLDED PIECE FOR FIT AND FINISH.I HAVEN'T SEE ANY IMPROVE IN MILES, MOTOR SOUND LOOK THE SAME AS BEFORE USING THIS OIL; MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN COULD SEE SOMETHING, SO FAR IS THE SAME AS CONVENTIONAL .PRICE ON AMAZON, E-BAY AND PARTS STORE LIKE : AUTOZONE,O'REALLY, NAPA ARE TOO HIGH, $ 36 +,  SO GO TO WAL-MART THEY HAVE IT FOR $ 24 TO 25 A GALLON OF 5 Q.GIVES YOU THAT EXTRA 5 FEET YOU NEED  GREAT...CAN SET MY LAPTOP ON MY BENCH INSTED OF BENDING OVER IN CAR WITH A BAD BACK.
This is a nice alternative to welding a tab on a hitch for a sway control. While I don't plan on having to move it to another hitch it is nice to know that if I had to I could. Which is something that can't be done with a weld on tab.I bought this tool on a whim, since it's fairly cheap, preparing to replace the rear brake pads on my 2003 Beetle 1.8t.  None of the sides had the correct spacing to retract the caliper piston.  I rented a kit from an auto parts store beforehand to be safe and needed it in the end.That said, I am going to keep this tool for future cars.I use this to monitor my RV battery.  Even though I have a solar system charge controller which displays voltage too, I use this sometimes to double check before I plug additional items in one of several 12 volt sockets I had installed.  I like it so much for its simplicity, that I'm buying a 2nd one for my truck.  This gadget is so simple to use and so accurate, that if you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.  More than worth the price!  Gives me a peace of mind at a glance.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well, no issues. Would purchase again.
As expected this does the job. No sure what GM was thinking making the engine with the cap below the intake manifold like that to begin with...but with this tool, it is a doable job. I tried a variety of work-a rounds before ordering, this is cheap and what you need.No problems with the great products but watch the packaging done by Amazon on this one. All of this came individual in a large box not in a Meguiar's kit box. I had to make sure that everything in the picture is what I actually got and it is.This item appears to be the same as what you'd get from the dealer, only at a fraction of the price.  personally, i like the baking soda odor neutralizing ones better, but this is good also.
Use a 6 gal plastic gas can. Been using mine for 8 years so far.Currently have used them for 6 months with no issues.  Purchase to charge two jet skis in boathouse.  Working great. also purched two 12 ft extensionsI have all Husquvarna 10 year old weed eater, 25 year old chain saw and 2 year old blower. Mix this with 100 percent gas a feel the difference
A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom.paid $3.17 here ....... cheaper than "wally world". I bought three as these work on my motorcycles. filters the dirt, protect my engine.the "classic" purolator filter is way better than a fram (more pleats of filter media) IMO.I'm using these on a Kawasaki EX 500 Ninja but the L14610 will fit any Kawasaki or Honda motorcycle that uses a cartridge oil filter and has enough room , these are approx. 3.25 inches in length .....Or you can use the L14612 which is shorter (2.5 inches in length).why give your hard earned money for the oem filters which are made as cheaply as the motorcycle manufacturer can buy them and branded with their logo.....crappy filters is what you get from the dealer..... I want my stuff to last, LOL.These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***
Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.I cut this extention in half and either solder and use shrink tube or use but connectors with shrink tube and have used it on my bikes or vehicles ove the years as add on accessory disconnects. I use the red as positive and the white as negative and the exposed white connetor with the covered red connector to connect to the battery to protect the wire from shorting out.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
Fits perfectly, will not slip and 3/4 the price in an RV accessory store (same Thing).  Cleans off in a JiffyUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM!I have this on my 27ft TT.  It fits the latch nice and secure.  I would reccomend this to anyone needed a little protection.I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
For my GAS engines I either purchase Bosch Premium (Black) or Purolator PLs (Yellow).  I've read that they are the same filter now.  Don't know.  What I do know is that they are both quality filters for less than $6 from Amazon.  I change them when indicated either by the manual or the driver info readout on the dash.  Never a problem.The Purolators do have the nice little texture grip, but hardly a deal breaker / maker.  These things fit and if you do a web search on filter testing, they are both consistently at the top of the ranks.Purchased these for emergency use with our 2009 FIT.  I have not used them yet, but made sure they fit the wheels and did not hit anywhere in the wheel wells.  They were fine on both counts.  Also seem to be of high quality, given the price.  The only comment I might suggest to the next purchaser is regarding rubber tighteners which Amazon lists as an item frequently purchased together.  The chain manufacturer's instructions state that you should not use rubber tighteners with these cable chains as it might pull them off center and then cause damage to tires/vehicle from the chains.I have had no problems using these and they work as described.  I do not like, though, that you have to hammer in the retaining tab to prevent the platform arms from coming out.  I also do not see how these are really double locking.  I wish they came with a adapter for the saddle since the saddle area is pretty big, but I knew that these weren't completely flat saddles (I made an adapter).  I would recommend them, but know what you are getting before you pull the trigger on getting them.
This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price.A VOM is a VOM, but his is a nice compact meter for all around use. Can't beat the price.Nothings bulletproof but for the price it is bullet resistant.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Wanted covers for the trailer tires to extend their life due to sun damage. These were inexpensive but they fit fine and the adjustable straps hold them securely.Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at allGreat quality, heavy duty with secure center. Should never bend or have the center piece come separate from the body. Fits perfectly on my Honda oil filters. Much better than the standard ones in auto parts stores. Would definitely buy again.
I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular.
Five stars for price and for doing exactly what it is supposed to do.  It also seems to be unbreakable in that it survived shipping.  Amazon didn't pack the box very well; I guess taking the manufacturer at its word and the claim that it is unbreakable.  I purchased two of these, both of which came in boxes that were utterly smashed up by heavier items in the box.  Both arrived unscathed anyway, although with one, the two halves had come apart.  It slid back together easily, so no big deal.I am using these on standard HVAC registers in our new house.  In two places we ended up needing to place furniture over top of a register.  We wanted something to direct the airflow out from under the furniture instead of blowing air into the bottom of it.  These do that well, and the magnets have held them in place.  Just slide the sides apart to the width you need and set them down.  Done.  I would recommend them, and will buy more if we rearrange things and need to cover other registers.Let me say that for the price ($6.50) it's hard to complain.They are a heavy gauge steel and look like they will hold up to a reasonable amount of weight (that is, I doubt you'd have anything in a grocery bag that would create a problem for them.They came a little bent up...easily fixed.What I didn't like was that the protective end was not plastic or rubber, but wood - 2 of them were delivered unattached to the ends of the hooks  - and just like in the picture of one of the other reviewers, one of them split in half when I tried to put it back on.I need to find some new caps to replace the wood - as the ends are just a little jagged without the protective ends on - I suggest that the manufacturer switch to plastic or rubber - and something that stays on.------------------UPDATE: Downgraded my review...Soon all of the wooden caps had broken off. This created a hazard for little kids in the back seat as well as my flip up rear seat... They are only useful if they are in the car - and I had to take them out to save eyes and upholstery.Had these back in the 80's and they have not changed.  My package arrived with one level ok, and the other missing the entire level glass globe.  No broken glass or liquid in the shipping package, it was just not there.  How did it get by Hopkins quality control, packaging, shipping, and Amazon without being caught?
I have been using these towels to remove wax for years on my cars.  They are wonderful.They are extremely soft and can be flipped many times during the removal process.  If there is any stray drops of water from washing the car these mop it right up.  They also fare well in the washing machine and come out looking like new.Buying these in 3 packs is a great deal and they will last you a long time.I haven't had a chance to use them in the rain but for normal riding they are very good.  Easy to put on with the two zippers and they seem to have a complete liner that is waterproof.  Comfortable too.  They are not SIDI or BMW quality but for the price are fine.This was added after a 4 hour ride in the rain.  This boot is a rain magnet, I had so much water in these it could be dumped out.  I need to change these to NO STARS as the main point of buying a waterproof boot is to have it be water-proof and these are NOT.  Don't buy these if you want any sort of water resistance or water proofing as they are bad for that.They are nice bulbs, but don't last near as long as factory bulbs, and the headlights in a 2004 Dodge Ram are so poor, that not even these bright bulbs help.  I had to mount off road lights to use with my high beams, to take care of the problem.  I'm sure these bulbs are fine for other vehicles, but there's no hope for factory 2004 Ram headlights.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer.I ordered these to have on hand when one occasionally breaks since they are made of plastic. The sun usually is to blame but sometimes you will pull on the storage door without releasing the catch and bingo they snap off like hard candy. These spares will come in handy when the need arises.
should have been standard from the factory. this is a area of wear and these do the job of protectionthis product is as good as the turtle platinun, carnauba Meguiars. and the prices are similar as well as the quality of the three brands, the brightness of the car depends on the quality of the painting and not the wax. for this reason the high prices of other products can not be justified, after several years of experience in this field I recommend fulfill any of the three, I recommend waxing every month depending on weather and if the car is exposed or not the sun ..The Meguiar's X2020 are the best bang for the buck, bar none!  What separates them from MOST other microfiber towels is that they are LARGE in size.  Most other microfiber towels, including the popular Zwipes here on Amazon are much smaller so you need 2-3 of them to do what 1 of these X2020's do.  The X2020's are also high quality and remove wax or detailing polish/liquid so smoothly.  The roughly $2 or so price per towel is pricey but b/c of what they do, it's definitely worth it.  Next time Amazon has a sale, i'm loading up on these again.
Not sure why Harley can't put this nut on their filters, or maybe an inward 1/2" driver hole.  Anyway, it makes yanking this thing off much easier because the strap wrench or the Harley-style filter wrench doesn't let you get your hand in there to manage the filter and all the oil that pours out after it comes loose.  This helps me ensure a clean oil change... as clean as it can be.  Not sure why they chose 17mm for the bolt size, but whatever.  What I wasn't excited about was that, at least for me, the black paint seemed to not be "as black" as the Harley filter, or it may have faded or been affected negatively by road salt or something.  It wasn't gray or anything, it just wasn't as black as the Harley filter I replaced it with (because I couldn't wait for shipping from Amazon.com).  Not a big deal... it's still black.  Just not... as black.I put this plug into my BMW F650GS and it runs like a different bike.  No stumble or surging at part throttle and great response all the way to red line.  I was thinking I was going to have to get a $200 electronic device to fix the stumble but an $8 plug fixed it.  I wouldn't have believed it but....... just saying.i bought it thinking it was shinier than the cheaper ones that come in a spray canister. i was wrong they are pretty much the same. and little annoying things like not properly labeling the nozzle to let you know if your spraying wide or narrow is a pain. you have to spray to know whether the on setting is narrow or wide. this is my first week using it and i gotta tell yah this thing doesn't look like its going to last, even gingerly spraying this on my tire is wasting the spray at an alarming rate. i don't know if its just my bottle that came a little cracked but whenever i spray somehow someway the liquid leaks through the openings and gets all over my hands.other than that, the seller is fast and the package came in good condition.
After owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!!After observing that my Radio Shack test leads don't conduct electricity very well, I decided to upgrade to this set. Generally I have been happy with my purchase but the large number of small parts is a concern. Extech provides tiny dust caps for many of the conductive surfaces, which should improve their longevity. While these are a nice touch, they are likely to get lost.  Additionally, the base cables are separate from the probes and clips, creating 12 separate parts.  Adding the slim reach test probes, which would be purchased separately, there will be a total of 14 items in the case.It would take a longer time period to truly evaluate this product as the corrosion resistance of the surfaces along with the durability of the PVC cables will be the key indicators of value. Meanwhile, the cables and probes appear to be well made.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the flared design of the main probes can be less than ideal in tight spaces.  So, you might want to consider purchasing the Extech TL743 Slim Reach Test Probe Set at the same time.  Note the term "set" in the case of the slim reach test probe set is a bit misleading because there are only two probes without case or cables.  They will fit nicely in the existing case.The Extech TL809 Electronic Test Lead Kit is a solid value.  There is some room for improvement, such as integrated caps, but this would most likely come with an increase in expense and some additional limitations.  For no additional expense, Extech should include the slim leads in the base kit and make the flared probes optional.  At this price point, this lead set is highly recommended.ProsNice carrying caseComes with probes, alligator clips and plunger mini-hooksDust caps on conductor surfacesConsToo many small partsFlared test probes too wide for some applicationsI bought some really bad fuse holders that had some horrible fuses included. I had to replace the fuses with the ones from this ATD. These fuses are great quality and they include all the common fuse sizes which is great. This is a sweet buy when you consider your local auto parts store asks $3-$5 for just a pack of 3 fuses in one size. You get alot of fuses in the most common amperage's. Please note these are just one size fuse, There is still one size larger blade fuse and two smaller sizes. Check what you have before ordering. Personally I got them for my fuse-able links I'm adding for all the accessories I have added to my vehicle. When you do any accessory installs in your vehicle I recommend fusing at the point you tapped power from. Better safe than sorry.
This sunshade is exactly what my Prius needed! The last ones I got were too small but these are actually a bit too big it manageable. The only issue is that because they are so large my rear view mirror gets in the way...but again it's manageable. All I have to do is just sorta smoosh them in and the window is covered.These are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.Super light weight, that's why the 2 stars. Some people would like how light they are but not me, I'd think if you crashed the road would chew these up like it was nothing. So ill save my feet and get some real thick boots
Both of my older cars had their factory nozzles falling apart thanks to arizona sun. I ordered these, funny they are same help brand sold at the zone, and installed them in 1 minute. They work great, yes you adjust them by just pushing the metal nozzle around, which you can do with factory nozzles as well. I prefer these spray pattern over factory. Factory was just like 2 streams, like a water gun, these are two fans of spray. The factory streams barely covered the window, these cover the whole thing in 2 seconds.I purchased this harness with a 2 position battery tender thinking the tender wouldn't come with 2 connectors. I was wrong and the tender came with 2 connectors. This is exactly the same as the OEM ones and I have not needed to use it yet.One month update:I am still very pleased with the horns, and increased my rating from 4 to 5.  I originally gave the horns a 4 rating because they weren't as loud as I was expecting, but now think they are just perfect just as they are.Original review:I replaced the wimpy original horn on my 2001 Sebring Coupe LXi with this pair of horns as part of a bigger make over.  It took about 20 minutes with great results.  Not as loud as I would have liked, but much better sound more likely to get attention when needed.  I was mystified that some of the reviewers apparently only installed one or the other of the horns.  They are meant to be installed as a pair (even if you only have one horn as original equipment).  If you do have only one horn its a simple matter to re-wire for two horns.  The package includes simple easy to follow wiring diagrams and a pair of ground wires (one for each horn).  In my case I had one power wire to one horn, so I joined two wires together at the male end (to plug into the power lead) and two separate female ends to plug into the horns.  Same arrangement for the ground except the joined end is attached to the frame of the car for a ground.  I installed both horns side by side on the tab the original horn was attached to.  Not too hard and sounds pretty good.
Awesome. You could run a regular (probably orange) extension cord through your garage and then have your battery tender plugged into it on the floor and trip over it constantly or you could buy one of these extensions made for the tender and have it run along your ceiling inconspicuously or run along the baseboard of a wall out of sight and then have it come up right where you need it for your car, truck or motorcycle.It's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it.For long term accuracy you will have to screw these to your RV. Or you can buy a carpenters level on Amazon and place it on the Floor of your RV to check it for level.
I have this tender hooked up to four Harleys.  I can easily glance at the tender box to check each battery's status.  I bought four extension cables to ensure I can hook up bikes at a distance.  I highly recommend this product.  I had a single battery tender which lasted me seven years.  I hope this one lasts just as long.I replace these about every two years or about 60 days of camping.  If you use your RV more thanyou may want to replace it more often.  This one is for a 6 gal tank and we have a 10 gal tank.  We did buy one last year for the 10 but it would not fit.This replaces my previous one of these that just failed after 8 years of good service keeping my summer only vehicles' batteries charged over winter storage. You will likely need to get one or more accessories such as the 12 volt extension cords so you can reach all your vehicles, cigarette lighter plug-in instead of standard battery clips that come with the unit, etc. Highly recommended. Also have the two bank unit that was causing am radio interference on the house circuit, returned it under warranty and they repaired it on a timely basis. I am able to get very long battery life using Battery Tender products.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.
Love this thing - the LED's are a simple verification and the device seems to fit snug and secure in the socketI cut the horn off the compressor. The horn will fit under the stock cowbell. The compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with 3 large zip ties. I ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire. The horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h3ll.  Many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.There is no need to lower muffler, just let it cool then install the hitch. You may also want to purchase the bracket for the trailer wiring flat 4 connector . (Hopkins 48595 flat 4 bracket)Just what I needed to install two lighter/power sockets under the seat of my motorcycle to power my mobile electronics.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other.

It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellVery happy with this purchase, as it save piling bricks or boards under the trailer tongue jack to shorten the amount of cranking necessary.  I would recommend this to anyone with a trailer.I used this wax on my Platinum Gray VW and the surface had a near perfect mirror reflection.  I will continue to use this wax
I cut this extention in half and either solder and use shrink tube or use but connectors with shrink tube and have used it on my bikes or vehicles ove the years as add on accessory disconnects. I use the red as positive and the white as negative and the exposed white connetor with the covered red connector to connect to the battery to protect the wire from shorting out.I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses.Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!This is pretty much a complete car kit for cleaning a car.I use Meguiar's product often for waxing and detailing my autos.I especially like using detailing wax because of the shine and easeof shining the whole car in a short period.I would recommend this kit for anyone that takes pride in their ride.Complete Microfiber Towels Car Kit - 2 All Purpose Microfiber Towels - 1 Microfiber Towel For Streak Free Glass- For Home Or Auto - 2 Ultra Plush 16 by 24 Microfiber Auto Detailing Towels - 1 Auto Dust Pad For Home Or AutoI love Royal Purple and have used it for 6 years now.  I fail to understand how packaging of 12 quarts of product offers a cheaper customer $/quart than a 5 gallon container. From someone who comes from a manufacturing of consumer goods job this pricing structure is bogus.  Had the pricing been better for the 5 gallon on a per quart basis I would have rated my purchase of the 5 gallon a 5 star.
If you have an RV with load-range tires that require 80psi, then spend the extra coins for a compressor that is dependable in a roadside emergency.  With the extension air hose there isn't any problem reaching the rear wheels on the trailer.  Think about what your needs are and toss those cheaper cigarette lighter plug-in models.  You get what you pay for.  It was nice that the price was reduced 50% when I purchased this one.installed the unit in an BMW e46 320D Wagon and the unit works ok... but sometimes you get that wiper switch slap you dont with other brands.... install Valeo brand instead if you can..!Recommended for use in all hybrid vehicles. You can extend the oil change out to past 10K miles with no effects. If you have a GenII Prius (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, or 2009) you should also buy the Purolator PL20195 PureONE Oil Filter (also available on Amazon). This is a bigger filter than the stock one, but if you are pushing out your oil changes, a bigger filter is cheap insurance.
Amazon doesn't sell this plug for my Subaru.  I'm putting it here as a public service.  I had four of these in my Subaru for 50000 miles.  They worked fine.  Except one had the whole corner of the ground electrode shear off.  I don't know if it's still in the cylinder or not, but the whole corner is cleanly gone. Overall, there's not much wear on the ground electrode.  The spark was grounding almost on the side of the electrode after that part of the electrode sheared off.  Not good.  And I still wonder if I don't need to stick a magnet on a stick down the spark plug hole and try to get that piece back.Anyway, the laser iridium probably solves this as the ground electrode has a platinum disk on it.I specifically bought this because I thought that it would come in blue, which seems like its the official color of my car. It came in red, which is the only COMPLAIN I have about the brush.Now it does a great job of cleaning the snow with the brush, the ice scraper shaves ice off just fine, it didn't snap off on me even when it was below 10 degrees outside, and the grip is nice. The brush itself is very long, and when I sit in the drivers seat, i can actually clean the side view passenger side mirror with it when I roll my window down. So its a lazy man's tool at that rate too!CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these coversThese are great blades made by Anco.  They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.  They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.  They are easy to install and work great.  I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.  5 stars.
i just had to remove these on two vehicles,not these i mean the tinted ones. i had em on my truck for six years but now the cops are enforcing the law. Anything that blocks view or changes the color of the plate is not legal in a lotta states. I hope the cops dont mind these clear ones...Okay so I'm sure everyone has their preferences. I haven't tried everyone on the market - but of the ones I have, these are the best. I try not touch my exterior of my car with anything, but if I have to these are the only ones I trust. They are the softest and thickest Microfiber I have ever owned. I use them more regularly for wiping down my interior, windows, and mirrors. They wash well, and there's no left over tag bits or rough parts on the towel. Meguiar always has great products, IMO.After my local BMW motorrad dealer nicked my cast alloy rims on the last tire change, I decided they would never work on my bike again.  So, now I change tires myself and these tools are excellent for the job (I use plastic rim shields to prevent rim damage).  Mine have gray handles, but say USA on them, so I believe they are indeed made domestically, which is another big plus.
These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made.My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!
I was going to get some regular jack stands but am very glad i paid the extra $20-$30 and bought these. I haven't used them yet, but they look awesome and are very light and well made. The red is anodized and looks better than they do in the picture. Highly recommended. They seem very strong. Will post update if they fail to amuseAlthough they fit my Honda Odyssey, these jumbo shades aren't as big as myBasix Magic Shade Super Jumbo Sunshade.  I have to put them in "portrait position," compared to the others, which fit in "landscape position."  The Altus shades are vinyl, not metallic, so they don't cool the car as well.  However, they do appear to be more durable.Folding is not difficult but I know it frustrates some people, like my husband and my in-laws.  There's a knack to it, but it's a very quick motion once learned.  I like it much better than accordion style shades.Too big to fit with a typical jar of paste wax. I suppose they would work well with liquid waxes and polish. I however, completely underestimated the size of these. The feel is nice and they fare pretty well in the washer and dryer witch is nice. I would give them 4 stars if they were smaller.
Used these microfibers for clay barring, polishing, waxing and quick detailing. They work great and I would highly recommend them to anyone.Worked great for my 14000 lb trailer.  Way better than jack stands, as these allow for slight adjustments to ensure you're totally balanced.Wranglers are not known for great headlights, these will fix this.  Takes about ten minutes to replace the stock units.  These have a great beam pattern and allow you to ditch the sealed beam lights.
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these covers
If you plan to use wheel chocks frequently, more than 2 or 3 times per year, you should consider investing in a better (more expensive) set. But, if you only need a set of chocks to occasionally do some DIY on your vehicle, these will fit the bill nicely and will not empty your wallet.They are made of hard plastic. They are not rubber, so be aware of that when you decide. However, I have used them several times to change wheels on my vehicles, and they work just fine. The little cord on them is not of much use, except for carrying them. You'll never yank them out from under a wheel (when pinched) with this little cord. A good hammer tap or kick usually does the trick.One complaint I have is that there is no "grip side" to these chocks. They are smooth plastic on all sides. There are moulded ribs on the flat side, but if you are working on a smooth surface, like a garage floor, they will not grip at all. So it is important to ensure they are tightly wedged. Some strips of rubber on the bottom surface would have been nice.Overall, they work fine if you don't plan to put them to hard routine work.Easily flexible, not difficult to work into the slotted channel. Just set one side and work the other as you go across - shouldn't be any need for tools to insert this unless you have screws holding the channel that were not centered and flat in the channel.  If that's the case, you'll want to use a plastic type tool to avoid puncturing the vinyl.I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.
please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesThese are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.jDo what the ir suppossed to do.  I like these so much better than the MOPAR ones that wrap arounf the roll bar.  These actually use existing hardware on the sound bar or on the windsheild.  You can also place them behing the headrest.  I have the MOPAR velcro ones and these look so much better.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Working well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem.

This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape.

The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun.
If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.These are a whole lot better than my stock nozzle. Will spray a fan of fluid, it is adjustable and comes with the adjuster key, silver thing in the picture.The only thing I wish was different was being able to adjust the spray higher than what the limit is at now. It is just barely clearing the whipper blade, but the stock one had been so clogged that is wasn't getting above it at all.It is on a ball type adjustment, so all angles and such, just the angle of my hood is the issue, overall, way better and even spread.As high beams are on only when its really dark I liked the increased field of vision how it increased the sides and the length of what I can see.  Yes I would buy them again.
After purchasing my new Tundra Crewmax and putting a lift on it I found that I could no longer fit in my garage. My driveway is just long enough to fit the truck, so the closer I could get to the garage door I can get the better. After looking around I found this AccuPark. Ordered and received in about two days. Now there is no guess work when parking, and no chance of hitting my garage door. Awesome adhesive, I planned on replacing that right away as most are the cheap 3M crap you can get at Wal-Mart. This is the industrial strength stuff, I would need a hammer and chisel to get it off my driveway.I am on my 4th Trailer/RV. I have used different devices to keep my trailers from moving over the years. With tandem wheels the best way seems to put a spreader style lock between the tires. I have had a pair of this style for quite a while. They were the style that you adjusted them, then placed them between the tires and pulled a lever up while trying to keep the bottom from coming up, I did this with an old wrench holding the bottom down. With two bad shoulders this was getting to be a dreadful experience. Finally they were just too rusted and I just couldn't keep them adjusted.I have had my eye on this style for a while but thought they were expensive. Well I finally took the leap and I am happy I did. They are easy to put between the tires and crank them tight. My trailer is more stable now than ever before. I did buy two of them and a wrench came with each so I have a spare. The box wrench has two different sizes, one on each end. It is also a ratcheting wrench. So I marked the end that fits the device and also marked the wrench for which side to be up to put them on and which side to be up to take them off. This set up is so much easier! Suppose you could buy the cheaper set but I like the way these press and fit on the tires.Wish I would of bought these sooner.Update: We have used these on several trips now. Our trailer is SOOOO much more stable now. Very easy to put on and with these cranked tight and with my stabilizer pads down we are rock solid.I used these two jack stands to hold a Nissan Maxima front end up and they worked without any issues. I will be testing the locking pins to see if they will hold the weight when the latch arm is pulled because I'm curious.
good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.a little disappointed. Did not work as well as the Chrome wheel cleaner.Ordered this so we could do oil change jobs on our 2010 equinox.  Yes it works for the 2.4 as well as the 2.2 that its advertised for.  Does the job as intended.  Don't like the way chevy set up their filters but oh well what can you do.
Used it to bling up a chrome palm tree license plate frame.  Went from boring to wow!  I even get asked where I got the frame.I've put this on and axle upside down, it stays where I put it, and so do the bolts, washers, and nutesLazy As. Husband wouldn't put it on Kawasaki bike, have cruise control on Harley Davidson Full Dream Dresser !!! So i don't know what to do with it.
I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase.I purchased this charger because I termed it 'smart' because of all of the different charging modes it employs.  The deciding factor for this particular model is that it has the constant voltage that you can use when you disconnect the battery to clean the terminals or change the battery.  More important to me than the radio presets are the engine control module settings.  It's nice not having to wait for the computer to relearn the particular variations of settings from the default ones.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.Got these for $25 shipped, and they look good.  Can't understand why Chrysler does not include these from the factory.Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size.
These Jumper cables are heavy Duty, Yet easy to Store. I keep them in one of my containers on my delivery vehicle. They are high quality. They are 4 gauge cable, so they are perfect and long enough to Start are Utilimaster Diesel trucks when are batteries are run Down. There are more expensive cables and even more sever duty use cables. these are perfect for this type of vehicle in an Emergency. The cost is reasonable as well. With 25 feet, you don't have to get real close to the other vehicle. you can pull up to the back and or side and just run the cables under or down the side of the vehicle.There are several of these on Amazon, but Camco makes lots of RV products. Keep you knives and body parts safe. Knives do not fall during travel.these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level
put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions.Do what the ir suppossed to do.  I like these so much better than the MOPAR ones that wrap arounf the roll bar.  These actually use existing hardware on the sound bar or on the windsheild.  You can also place them behing the headrest.  I have the MOPAR velcro ones and these look so much better.We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThese worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.I have used these jack stands with my BMW E46 convertible and E90 sedan.  The stands are nicely finished, light weight, and durable.  For safety reasons, I will only use jack stands with a locking pin, and these fit the bill.  (I also like to put a tire/wheel under the car as backup)  Recommended.
Nothing more than a 3/8's extention welded to a spark plug socket. However, the lack of movement (wobble) in the extention allows for a more precision torque application, which helps mitigate plug breakage. While this tool isn't a remedy for spark plugs that break no matter how much care is taken, it does help to keep the broken plugs to a minimum. I feel that it was a worthy investment for a delicate procedure. Any extra help on this job will make a difference.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.fast shipping and a good price. I bought this and the cleaner separately instead of the combo kit because I think you get more for your money this way. Oil was easy to apply (best used outside for aeration purposes). Never buy a air filter again.
Positioned 2 of these fore and aft of the optimul wheel location - haven't backed into the bikes or lowered the garage door on the bumper since!our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.

It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!does the job.does job.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI did not install yet.

Although they fit my Honda Odyssey, these jumbo shades aren't as big as myBasix Magic Shade Super Jumbo Sunshade.  I have to put them in "portrait position," compared to the others, which fit in "landscape position."  The Altus shades are vinyl, not metallic, so they don't cool the car as well.  However, they do appear to be more durable.Folding is not difficult but I know it frustrates some people, like my husband and my in-laws.  There's a knack to it, but it's a very quick motion once learned.  I like it much better than accordion style shades.Not an exact replacement, but it works fine.  I hope it lasts longer than the original.  The California sun eats up all the plastic that they use on these camping trailers in just a year or two.They are nice bulbs, but don't last near as long as factory bulbs, and the headlights in a 2004 Dodge Ram are so poor, that not even these bright bulbs help.  I had to mount off road lights to use with my high beams, to take care of the problem.  I'm sure these bulbs are fine for other vehicles, but there's no hope for factory 2004 Ram headlights.
I've always like Purolator products.  In comparisons I've read and demonstrations I've seen, Purolator has always come out at or near the top. It's a brand name with a long history, and Amazon has these at a good price.  I could go to a discount store and buy an off-brand for half the price, but I would always worry about what was going on in the engine.I've been using this filter on my 99 Corolla for the last few oil changes. Switched to this filter based on testing results I had read online which seemed to indicate the PureONE lines are fairly effective. Have not had any problems.Has my '10 Mini Cooper shifting like butter even in single digit temps. I've never beendisappointed in a Redline product.
I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.

But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.

Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.There are plenty of RV Park type campgrounds out there.  However I like the scenic view and smells of a wooded campground.  There's just one problem with these.  In my area of the country, these are usually built on a ridge and the pads aren't always as level as they could be.  For owners of most larger rigs, you know well that the stablizer jacks have NO ability to level a trailer that isn't level.  Enter the Camco Tri-Levelers.  Back your trailer into within 18" of your intended final stopping point on the pad.  Lay a pair of these right behind the rear tires of the trailer, making sure their parallel with the tires.  Back up until you've achived your desired height.  On asphalt these will not move.  Then use a pair of standard chalks to chalk the front tires.  After that, your set, drop your trailer and set it up.Why do you need them?  Of course, camp long enough and you'll see everything from people driving their trailers onto 2x8s to slabs of concrete.  These are MUCH safer, will not rot, will not slide, and will not crack.  They are study and made of think ridged plastic.  Each one I would say weighs about 5 lbs so they'll still be lighter than anything else you carry.  And they will last forever!  You could safely leave these under your rig for years without worrying about damage from weather or sunlight.Why not 5 stars?  Three reasons...  1) It's not safe to use these on your own without a spotter.  An experienced RVer can back his rig onto a pad with no assistance.  However with these it's just not safe.  You could easily back off the back edge since the rear lip is no taller than the ones to each tier of leveling.  2) These are only suitable you rearward sloping pads with minimal side-to-side slope.  Due to the face that these are only 18" long they cannot level a tandem axel trailer from side to side as both axels will not touch the leveler.  And they are too long to fit a second Tri-leveler under the front tire for standard trailers.  Though side-to side leveling would be possible for single axel trailers.  3) Final placement is important as it could damage your tires (especially if being left for a season.)  When I use them and the trialer is still hiched it pinches the tire.  After leveling this seems to go away.  But if it didn't and you were concerned for your tires, this would mean rehitching and adjusting.  Each level is only about 5" long by approximately 9" wide.  So tire contact can be an issue.  For more agressive slopes, my recommendation after using them a couple of times.  Drive you rig onto them until the rear of the chock (whichever level your using) is pinching your tire.  And making sure you don't drive off the back!  Then when you let the tongue down it will stop pinching and sould be just right.Final thoughts...  These levelers are purpose built for the most common type of leveling.  They do very well at that.  They don't do well with other types of leveling.  Though I suppose you could use them with a foward slope as well if you were creative with your tongue jack.  If it seems like I'm being critical of them, I'm just trying to give an honest review.  I do think they are a great, well built product that is worth owning if you enocounter this type of issue with your trailer.  If you have issues with side-to-side leveling, there are other products out there that will suit you better as well as cost you more.  Personally I own both since I never know what type of situation to expect.  I like the simple design.  No assemlby means they're easy to move.  Unless the situation requires it I will always grab these first for just that reason.  One final thing to consider.  Anytime you raise a tire or pair of tires on your trailer you're obviously going to have a more significant rise on the end of your trailer.  Make sure your carrying something to let you sill use your stablizing jacks.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Won't work miracles if you haven't washed your car, but provides a good looking shine in between your trips to the Car Wash. A must have.This product is a money saver and a must have in your garage if you are either do it urselfer or a professional
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back.There is no need to lower muffler, just let it cool then install the hitch. You may also want to purchase the bracket for the trailer wiring flat 4 connector . (Hopkins 48595 flat 4 bracket)There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.
Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be.Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckThe lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.it works, but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size, as it takes 2x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience, which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard.
I was in need of an Air Compressor but I did not want to get one that was huge.  This little guy is pretty small and does the job!  You set your PSI, plug it in and hook up to whatever needs air.  The Air Compressor will stop automatically once it reaches the preset PSI.  It is awesom if it ever breaks down I will be picking up another!If you own a motorcycle and don't ride much through the winter months this is a must have item.  It will keep your battery in tip top condition so you'll be ready to ride when the weather gets good.  Just plug in and forget itI keep this in the garage for when we're going out or I'm meeting a client and don't have time to get the cars washed and waxed.I use a microfiber cloth spray generously -- it leaves the car shining and with a water repellant coating - you can see the water bead up if you get hit with rain after using it.Only pulled one star back because it can take a couple passes to get a car clean if you haven't pre-washed it (which would defeat the purpose).  If you just spray and wipe, it tends to smear alot of dust and dirt around with visible residue.Either way, at a great Amazon price, its an essential for the trunk or garage.
I hate how they force a comment! There really isn't much to say except the item was as discribed and it arrived on time and functions as it should. Just be sure your RV is level with a 4 foot level on the floor both ways before sticking them on.I bought this, set the code by turning the screw inside the front of the unit, and sprayed with a silicone lubricant.After a month on the front bumper, in the WA rain, there's no sign of rust and the inside tray is dry.The thumb-wheels turn easily and front face plate is tight.I can't find fault with this and it seems pretty secure.Since I can't predict when and where I might lock myself out of the truck, I just leave this on the front receiver by CURT where it fit's just fine with the smallest gasket.I'm very happy with this purchase.Considering these stands cost about four times as much as a lot of others, and considering the five star reviews, I was expecting perfection.  Unfortunately, they have design flaws.First, the packing sucks.  Two stands come packed together in one box with bits of cardboard that are supposed to prevent the two stands and the two separated stand arms from rubbing together.  I'm not sure if they scraped through the cardboard or if it just shifted, but all of my stands have scrapes on them and in one place the metal is rusting where the paint was scraped.  The manual says if you see rust to scrape it off and repaint it.  I shouldn't have to do that when they're new due to bad packing.  Also, the scrapes reveal just how imperceptibly thin the paint actually is.The description says "Formed base adds stability and helps reduce sinkage into pavement".  When I think "formed base" I think formed as one solid piece.  Instead, the base has tiny triangles of metal welded to the _inside_ of each foot.  Then they carefully take a picture of the stand so you can't see what they did till you get it.  That would still be acceptable except they made no effort to level either the feet or the triangles.  On many of the feet, the triangle sits too deep in the foot so it wouldn't even touch the pavement until the foot edge had dug into the pavement.  In other cases, an edge of a crooked triangle will form a divot in the pavement before the rest of the foot or triangle touches ground.  They could have splurged for a tiny bit more metal to make the triangles large enough to rest the edge of each foot on the triangle, then set the whole thing on a flat surface while the triangles were welded.  I've seen other stands with that design.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the arm that locks the stands at a particular height doesn't move very far and so it's hard to tell by looking if the lock is engaged.  I agree this is a problem and I wish the teeth were deeper so it was easier to tell when a locking arm was fully engaged.  However, it's probably not really an issue because the weight of the yellow bar and the shape of the teeth and locking bar will force the locking bar to fully engage.  Even if the locking bar is rusty enough to prevent the weight of the yellow bar from fully locking it, the weight of the car certainly will.  I could possibly imagine a case where the tip of the locking bar is barely touching a tooth of the yellow bar and putting weight on the yellow could cause a failure, but I couldn't get it to sit like that when trying, so it's pretty unlikely.  However, as the jacks get rusty and teeth possibly wear, or if you simply get one with a small manufacturing defect, such a situation could become more likely.  So I'm not a fan of this design where locking can't easily be confirmed visually.  Even if they had made it so the locking arm sits perfectly horizontal while locked and an inch off horizontal when unlocked it would have been better.While doing my tests with the locking bar I created quite a bit of shaved yellow paint particles just from moving the yellow bar up and down by hand.  This is probably typical of the paint used on jack stands and maybe there's no avoiding it, but it certainly doesn't seem that they used any sort of premium paint.  The coating of yellow paint does seem to be thicker than the coating of blue paint, at least.I don't think the description (or the 3-ton label on each stand) makes it very clear that the 3 ton rating is per PAIR, not per stand.  You have to read the manual to find that out.  They also have big warnings in two places in the manual not to put a car on four stands.  Since it's fairly common for people to put cars onto four jack stands, I don't know if that warning is just there to cover their butts in case someone lifts a car wrong onto four stands and it falls over during lifting or if there's something about these particular stands that makes them bad for using four at once.  Perhaps the bases are just too small.  Of course, using four stands in earthquake country is just asking for trouble so that could be another reason.In case anyone was wondering, these stands only lock at a particular position.  Just because the description says "ratchet" doesn't mean you can ratchet them up while the car's weight is on them.  If you manage to move the locking bar with the car's weight on the stand (which actually shouldn't be possible due to the shape of the teeth), the stand will collapse to its lowest level.
Bought this to use with an air compressor. I didn't want to risk shorting out a fuse using the compressor in the cigarette lighter in the car.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.I use this on all my auto bulbs. Helps when you need to remove bulbs especially on my trailers an vintage vehicles. This is a, Must Have Item. I recommend this Dielectric Grease.
I began with Step 1 Polish, and Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, and finished up with the Step 3 Wax, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball put the wax on smoothly and uniformly, and after doing Step 1 and Step 2, my hands welcomed the break using the Powerball.  The car looks a brilliant white now.  With all the work preparing the finish, I put 3 coats of wax on it.  The car is a full-size, and there is enough Step 1 and Step 2 to do at least another car, and despite the 3 coats of wax, there is still enough in the bottle for maybe another 2 or 3 wax jobs.  Very pleased with the 3 Step process, and the Powerball.I bought two 5 gallon buckets from Home Depot for only about $3 each and these fit into the buckets perfectly.Tip: use the grit guard insert to mix the water and soapUsed this RTV to create a gasket on an F150 differential cover. Used about 1/3 to 1/2 tube on the diff cover to ensure adequate coverage.  Applied around the bolt holes.  Begins to get tacky in about 5 minutes. Installed diff cover and finger tightened bolts, let set for approx. 1 hour.  Then tightened bolts to OEM specs.  Filled with gear oil and no leaks.
if you buy at WlMrt(sorry I can't put the name of amazon will remove the review) this stuff really works, I have a 2010 Toyota Corolla and it has a gauge on the odometer area that says how much estimated MPG I get and I was using convectional Oil, when I put this Mobil 1 fuel economy in my car, my MPG went up by 0.5 MPG so know I was only getting 29 MPG now I am getting 29.5 MPG, thats still good, it's the same price as the other Mobil 1 when you buy at WLMRT, you will save money in the long run using this, I recommend it to every one.I gave these things a 2 star rating because we have 8 sets of them installed on our county patrol cars.  Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate.  I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night, 01/23.2014.  Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time.  Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue.  Other than that, they are a great, powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you.  Be safe and maybe look for another type of light that will give you longer service life before you spend the money on these.I have learned to pay attention to customer reviews - this product has some bad ones . First the auto off preset is fabulous and why I took a chance . I figured it would cost $12 to send back or more and since all users said the 12 volt part worked fine after the AC fuse blew I figured paying $36 for one like new out of the warehouse would be my best bet . If my AC fuse blows then for $24 I have a 12 volt only compressor and since it only draws 6 amps I can use my car jump pack .Now my two cents these are made for topping off tires if you fill one that is flat you need to let it cool off . All these compressors say do not run more then 10 minutes . I took all my tires on my van 15 inch from 40 pounds to 50 and did one tire at a time and each one was less then 2 minutes infact close to one and then I let it cool for a couple minutes and moved it to the next . Was done in about 12 minutes and it didn't get hot . If you leave the 12 volt power cord wound up like it comes it is no trouble at all to put back in the machine . It does have a handle it just doesn't look like one it is the tab on the top door . You grip it with 2 fingers there where it sticks out . I love this unit . I leave it next to my electric bike . Guage was spot on . I am very pleased . I have a quality viar pump which I highly recommend but on AC this does great . I imagine 12 volt is slower . But I believe this is much faster then the average $25 cheapo and that auto off feature and back lit gauge isn't on the cheapos . Love that it has nozzles for footballs and air matresses too . I am very pleased . I hated firing up my large compressor or hooking up to a car socket to fill bike , lawn equipment and even the car tires this is so nice especially the low draw . My viar can soak up 20 amps . At 6 most cars can handle this and I prefer to never use my car but a jump pack can usually handle at least 8 amps draw .This model is recommended to be used on AC in your shop and dc in your car on a trip it is very handy and for the average family the best choice for the $$$ I believe . Hope to keep it cool , never run it too long to heat it up and have years of use from both ac and dc sides .
Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter.For my GAS engines I either purchase Bosch Premium (Black) or Purolator PLs (Yellow).  I've read that they are the same filter now.  Don't know.  What I do know is that they are both quality filters for less than $6 from Amazon.  I change them when indicated either by the manual or the driver info readout on the dash.  Never a problem.The Purolators do have the nice little texture grip, but hardly a deal breaker / maker.  These things fit and if you do a web search on filter testing, they are both consistently at the top of the ranks.These bulbs are bright, but you need to remember that: Ebay HIDs &#60; These Bulbs &#60; HIR &#60; HID.  If you think that the PNP HIDs are the best thing out there then go buy them if you however want a bright light that will not get you flashed at these are for you.
This is pretty much a complete car kit for cleaning a car.I use Meguiar's product often for waxing and detailing my autos.I especially like using detailing wax because of the shine and easeof shining the whole car in a short period.I would recommend this kit for anyone that takes pride in their ride.Complete Microfiber Towels Car Kit - 2 All Purpose Microfiber Towels - 1 Microfiber Towel For Streak Free Glass- For Home Or Auto - 2 Ultra Plush 16 by 24 Microfiber Auto Detailing Towels - 1 Auto Dust Pad For Home Or AutoCurrently have used them for 6 months with no issues.  Purchase to charge two jet skis in boathouse.  Working great. also purched two 12 ft extensionsAfter owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!!
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckThis fit my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee V6. Price was great when I purchased. Can't beat having car parts shipped to your door for free.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckCan't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
The stock headlight and bulb in my Harley are just okay.  I put this bulb in and the light went from "on the border of" yellow to very white with a hint of blue.  I went down a dark, unlit road the other day and flipped on the brights - WOW!  Be sure your headlight is aimed right, because these things project out much farther than your old standard bulb.  We'll see how long they last on a rumbling Harley with a stiff suspension, but so far I'd recommend them if you can get them for around $50.I bought this because a friend told me about it and he was right because the shine is beautiful and it brings out the luster in the paint. Spray it on wipe it off wait and wipe off the hue and the car looks beautiful. If you go to car shows or want your ride to look like show room then buy this stuff,you can even spray it on the glass this stuff is great.When you first apply, this treatment looks great.  Then when it rains it streaks, so have to touch up.  This seems to occur even when applied and polished per directions.  When it is first applied though it really dressed up old flat dull black plastic trim on my vehicle.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckWorking well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.
Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didI love Lynx products, these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do. I would buy again.
It's got synthetic media in it, picks out about 99% of the metal content(you know how aluminum parts shed that real fine dust, right) from the oil. I don't suffer any flow rate issues or any pressure changes. I use mostly a high volume oil pump with a 60psi limit and have never had any mechanical failures form the oil.Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust.  Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid.  Will update with results.I use this to keep the battery charged on my motorcycle during the off season. No problems or complaints whatsoever.
They don't. I waited too long to try them so I can't return. The model optimizer clearly said this is what I should order. They are not sized properly. I've bought Bosch before too.I wanted some inexpensive seat covers and picked these.  So far they do the job as intended.  Time will tell how they wear and how long they last. As of now I'm satisfied with this purchase.Auto Expressions 5040620 Braxton Grey Bucket Seat CoverGreat price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.
They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models.Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico.
I replaced the factory horns on my 2001 Kawasaki Vulcan 1500 Nomad, which were actually pretty loud for factory horns.  These horns are real attention getters.  Great for use on the road.  Highly recommended.The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.What can be said. RV store in town 3 times the price, Amazon online for the same product is a blast at 1/3 the price. Switches work well, wire solder joints are good and the bulbs were all included. Did the job well, mounted perfectly in a 12 volt powered outdoor shop building and a RV ( I bought a bunch), Soon to buy more.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made.These covers are very good. They are not very fancy and don't come n velvet, but they are very durable, good for the price, don't slip, and simply do the job!
Not a cut and dry solution to opening RV screen door from inside. Works but sometimes you have to repeatedly have to do opener to get it to catch.These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern.These wiper blades feature a rubber booth which covers the joints holding the wiper blade. Meaning that no ice/snow/water can touch the joints so they are most unlikely to freeze.This allows the wiper blade itself to maintain its shape, the joints to still move and therefore allow the blade to stay closely to the windshield.I have been using them for years and always switch to them shortly before winter time.
What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.What can one say, test leads they work and they are priced right one recommendation is to sell a kit with an assortment of ends.We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.
They fit perfect, they do exactly what they are supposed to do, and I got them for a great price. What beats that?please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesMicrofiber so far is microfiber, they all seem to clean about the same, some leave behind a little less lent than others but for the price these aren't bad.  Now that being said these are smallest microfiber wash-cloths I have ever seen.  Seriously they are the same size as most washcloths, they are tiny! The package makes them seem bigger than they are.

The best part is there are optional wires that fit many needs or if you have multiple vehicles.It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too).
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.

Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.

Works just like it needs to.

a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
This is a piece of junk.! The straps stretch, the plastic clips slip off while tightening, and the dam things fall off while driving. Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on.  They do work well.Easy to put on, just move it into place and and snap it in.However, it depends on two clips on the bottom that are fairly thin. If you force it instead of maneuvering it into place, those clips with break and it won't stay on.I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience.

I bought this cover to use as a dust protector for my spare motorcycle that does not get much use. Because it is kept in doors I did not need a heavy duty cover. It does not appear that it would do well if put on a hot bike as the material is thin.For the price it is a good value, and it serves my purpose.Also Amazon's excellent service made me buy it.I didn't think it would, but it really does make a difference of have a wrap around rug on your entryway step ladder.I use this on myYuasa YUAM32ABS YT12A-BS Batteryto make sure it stays charged.  It's a must have during the winter storage months.  It takes a while to get to the float mode because it's the jr, but it does it's job.

I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date.
fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it.Works as advertised. Very easy to manipulate to get to the valve stem to check pressure on my motorcycle. It should since that is what is was made for.Simple device, works fine, not hard to read.  Nice to have this gauge to check tires from time to time and be able to verify what the tire guys are telling you.
3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter.This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it.This worked perfectly for my 2003 Ford Excursion.  It fit right over the tire and gave me the extra height I wanted to load bikes on the roof and a car top carrier.  Seems very sturdy and well made.  The bag that comes with it is a nice bonus feature.  I see what others have mentioned though about the adjustable step and folding it up in the bag.  If you place the step in any position except for the lowest, you will not be able to store it in the bag folded.  All that said, it will still fold up in that position and you could easily put a bunge around it and store it that way.
This strainer works, but can't fit even full size plates! It also is very flimsy. I would find another one!Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RVI needed anti-seize lubricant for use during an oxygen sensor replacement.  Big Box auto stores wanted entirely too much for it, but Amazon Prime saved the day with an 8oz bottle of name-brand Permatex that was reasonbly priced and quickly delivered.  I'd buy this again ... but this will probably last me a long, long while, as I'm a DIY/hobbyist type, not a professional mechanic.

The drop on this hitch is exactly what I needed for my Dodge Ram.  It makes hooking up my trailer a breeze.I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.I needed a decent filter wrench for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel.  The filter is up beside the engine and is best reached from below.  This wrench grips the round Amsoil Filter, Which is not wrench friendly with it's smooth surface. It holds the filter securely while I turn it with my 3/8&#34; ratchet using a nine&#34; extension.  Make sure you get the right size range for your filter size.

Great product to lift my Nissan Versa another 6 inches to get underneath.  They do the job, but the construction is alittle liteweight(some sort of hollow structured plastic/polycarbonate).  Recommended only for light compact cars with narrow tires.  Would recommend the Rhino Ramp 12000 if they were less expensive than $59.00, maybe more like $39.00.They are nothing fancy, some basic terry cloth sponges.I used them to apply waxes and leather care products.I own many fine leather items. When I need to clean them to remove grime and stains, then I prefer to use a terry cloth sponge, rather than a microfiber cloth. When I condition the leather, then I use the microfiber cloth which is much softer.I didn't have much problem with the lint issue, maybe Lexol improved these pads....?I washed them and they held up fine.But I do have to say, I prefer the Viking cotton terry sponge applicators better as those ones have a denser foam and are softer to the touch. In addition, I think the price for these Lexol pads are not such a good value, considering that one pad cost about $2.10. The Viking ones are much better value....If you want quality than look no further.  This is an awesome pad with a nice thickness to it. Not like those cheapies that feel thin and are flimsy.

Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.Can see the same welding issues as the other users, though I'm not sure if it would affect the maximum load (2 tons) the jack stands can hold. Sturdy jack stands, might be slightly high for some cars, depending on what you are trying to do (being too high isn't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more).Overall, simple no frills car jack stands. Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked, as well as the regular locking handle.
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.The ignition rotor is as advertised. It installed easily and does the job. I have no problem with recommending this product.This unit works well.  I used the supplied foam mounting tape and overnight the unit fell off the wall.  I remounted it with 3M foam tape and it has not moved in several months.  I would not mount it over a vehicle using any type of mounting tape.
These are basically a good product. I would say they are better than the OE catches on my RV. But make sure you keep the screws from the existing catches, or better yet, buy a pack of stainless screws. These do not come with mounting screws. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.These are the same as you could get at the local auto parts, but if you go there, you will stand in line waiting for a low paid & disgruntled associate and when they serve you (after they put their cell phone down), they will more than likely give you the wrong part and overcharge you for it. Overall, these wires are great and the di-electric grease provided is enough to get the job done.Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI
We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.The Meguiar's X2020 are the best bang for the buck, bar none!  What separates them from MOST other microfiber towels is that they are LARGE in size.  Most other microfiber towels, including the popular Zwipes here on Amazon are much smaller so you need 2-3 of them to do what 1 of these X2020's do.  The X2020's are also high quality and remove wax or detailing polish/liquid so smoothly.  The roughly $2 or so price per towel is pricey but b/c of what they do, it's definitely worth it.  Next time Amazon has a sale, i'm loading up on these again.I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2
please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesMy vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these covers
This is a piece of junk.! The straps stretch, the plastic clips slip off while tightening, and the dam things fall off while driving. Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on.  They do work well.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.
Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.These don't fit quite right onto the stems of my Pirelli P-Zero's. The dealership neglected to put a cap back on my tire -- so I bought these just in case. They get the job done, but don't expect them to look or fit the same.For myself, these might work? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs. These are not solid, they are a thinner plastic, maybe 1/4 of an inch thick. They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, not even a Go-cart racer.When I seen RhinoGear I imagined thick sturdy rubber chock-blocks not thin plastic cups.
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanksCan't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.

This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.Product was as described, and the instructions are actually pretty decent for this kind of product, which is kind of shocking. remove firewall, remove 1 screw, and pop open filter door. if you have the right tools, this takes less than 5 minutes. fresh air into the cabin and it has the noticeably cleaner smell. the screws to take out on the firewall are 9/32 and i think there were 3 of them. the 1 screw to take out on the cabin filter door was 7/32. make sure you find your tiny sockets! also the only thing you need to pay attention to when inserting this filter is the direction of air flow. there is an arrow on the filter - make sure it points toward the driver side.Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.
This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price.Just what it is - brass drain plug.  Normal quality as you would buy in a hardware store if you could find this configuration for this specific purpose.Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.
Matched my car's color perfectly!  I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review...arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.

Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.

I just used these pads for under my stabilizer jacks (see picture).  They work as described for my RV trailer.  Sturdy, hard plastic with a flat side and an indented, grid on the other side.

I have used these jack stands with my BMW E46 convertible and E90 sedan.  The stands are nicely finished, light weight, and durable.  For safety reasons, I will only use jack stands with a locking pin, and these fit the bill.  (I also like to put a tire/wheel under the car as backup)  Recommended.Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.

Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.I don't like the idea of keeping my top clamp clevis oriented straight up when using the Hi Lift Jack, because this Handle Keeper will slide down and get in the way of the Jack Handle when using the Hi Lift Jack.It does a good job at holding the handle in place during transport, etc.  I wanted to keep the top clamp clevis rotated so the jack wouldn't be so long when stored in my truck bed (I have a 6' bed and I have the 60&#34; jack).I cut this extention in half and either solder and use shrink tube or use but connectors with shrink tube and have used it on my bikes or vehicles ove the years as add on accessory disconnects. I use the red as positive and the white as negative and the exposed white connetor with the covered red connector to connect to the battery to protect the wire from shorting out.
I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.

All I have to do is pull them out, shake them a little bit to remove gravel and dirt, or spray them with water if they get muddy.  I would highly recommend the Husky brand liners.  I think they have a lifetime warranty, too!

Have had these for almost a year on my '13 JK Wrangler. They do a great job in keeping the door frames from getting scratched up and ruined. The glue strips are easily used on the back, by pulling off the protective paper coating, just place them onto the door jam, and hold in place for a moment. They stick in place even without the doors being on the Jeep for most of the year!I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well .I purchased these for a 2011 2 door jeep wrangler sport, they fit perfectly with little or no effort.all you have to do is clean the area with a damp cloth, wipe down with the provided prep pad and justline up the bolt dome cover. It's almost impossiable not to line them up correctly on the first try.
Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.I'm obliged to switch regularly between 1-7/8" and 2" balls on my hitch, and the Reese Interlock hitch balls make the swap a one-handed operation with the Reese Towpower hitch. That may not seem significant, but in inclement weather it allows you to hold an umbrella or tarp for protection and complete the swap with your remaining hand, in comparative comfort; the first time you have to change a ball in the rain, sleet or snow will sell you on one-handed swaps.
These refrigerator bars work well to keep your food from shifting around while driving down the road. They are adjustable and have strong springs which allow them to be moved and remain in place. The fridge in our camper did not come with any devices to keep food from moving around and we would often open the door after driving and have some of the contents spill out. These bars will prevent most of that from occurring.Had planned to drop these behind the wheels on the truck when we put the boat over.But they want to slip on the concrete ramp as soon as the tire tread starts to push.Doesn't seem to matter whether I plant them before easing the tires back, or hard-place them at the tires, because as soon as enough drift happens, the tire and chock move together.Installed these on the front corners of the travel trailer. Works great. Saves me from having to run around with the bubble level checking to see if the trailer is level front to back and side to side. Seem to stick pretty well also. Very Happy so far. Fast ship from Amazon.

The glue strips are easily used on the back, by pulling off the protective paper coating, just place them onto the door jam, and hold in place for a moment. They stick in place even without the doors being on the Jeep for most of the year!our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Working well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.perfect size and fit for changing automatic transmission fluid on an impreza holds about a quart and a half while it drips in
Works great for smaller seals but it couldn't pull out the rear main seal for a 2002-2006 MINI Cooper. These are very large seals. The tool just couldn't provide enough leverage for that. I used a flat blade screwdriver instead. Perfect tool for small and medium size seals.Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot.

This bag is well made and offers superior protection for my helmet. It's so large I could almost fit 2 helmets in it. That would be good for a modular or full face helmet.Bottles were bigger than expected (like pledge bottle size but a little fatter). The box was strong and in good shape. Products came on time (surprised with UPS lol). Wally World wanted same price for smaller ones. I would buy again. What you see in picture is what you get (aside from the K and N box).They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it.
I have had these on two Jeeps.  They work and fit exactly as advertised and the quality is fine.  They make getting in and out of the jeep easier especially for kids getting in and out of the back seats and they give the passenger some added stability over rough terrain.they are light and smaller than you would expect, but they work fine and store easy as they fit into one another (stackable)Wanted covers for the trailer tires to extend their life due to sun damage. These were inexpensive but they fit fine and the adjustable straps hold them securely.

Ok so I figured I would write a review since these seem to be new to amazon and they had prime shipping so I went for them.Firstly these are ATO fuses.  The description doesn't say it anywhere for some odd reason however they also sell a mini fuse set which is labeled correctly and the picture shows ATO fuses.  Anyways, the fuses came in a box that is actually pretty nice and latches properly shut.  Label says 1 year warranty although their fuses so shouldn't have a problem.  On the other side of the boxes label is a chart showing Tan = 5amp, Red = 10amp, Blue = 15amp, Yellow = 20amp, Clear = 25amp, Green = 30amp.The fuses themselves seem to be very nice quality and have the number on them printed clearly however it is the plastic color and not painted white.  Note that the link that connects the two ends is horse shoe shaped rather than zigzagged which is something I personally have never seen before.At ~$10 it was a great price for 120 fuses + an actual working container.I would say the claim of 51 watts equaling 115 watts is just not true! Based on the claim I figured these bulbs would just blow away my Sylvania Ultra Stars. Put the PIAA in one light and compared to the Sylvannia left in the other. Against my white garage door, I saw no visible difference in light output at all! Drove the truck and no difference. Color is only a very slightly different shade of white. I am not knocking PIAA as I know they do make quality products, but the claim is misleading.I bought these to haul my two kayaks.  Works great.  I would have given 5 stars, but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material.  Also, the flag it comes with was missing my first order, Amazon sent me a new one, but the flag is real cheap...just a piece of red thin plastic.
I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.Used these seat covers on a 1999 Ford Explorer Sport, and it fit perfect. Nice and snug, but woest get a little wrinkly after you break it in. You just have to readjust the crease area on the seat and its nice and straight.Very sturdy. Easy to drive up on when in the dirt, cement or gravel.  Slides backwards in the snow & we carry large nails to keep it in place in the snow.  They are quite large and barely fit into our storage compartment.  We had to cut off the handle in back to get it to fit.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI'm hoping the quality holds up as they appear plastic and my trailer weighs  over 5000lbs and sits on a small incline.  I will correct my review if they don't work but they were a good price.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous.
Purchased these to hold up the RV awning shade, placed a little fabric glue on the rubber shaft so they don't fall out.  They work good.Good LuckI purchased some much thicker microfibre towels, as these ones just aren't thick enough to soak up sufficient water. These are now relegated to cleaning the windows and wiping down the interiorNothing spectacular.  They work, they are as advertised, and they are a good value. The cables have a strange "feel" to them that will leave a residue on your hands.
Keep all those sham wows. I have used Absorber Chamois for years, much better than natural ones or any other brands.
These K&N; Filters are not made in the USA to my surprise.  They are made in Thailand.I probably won't buy K&N;'s anymore.  For 1/2 the price, I can get WIX filters made in the US.Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are.I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels.
These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern.I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them.I haven't even installed these yet, but they're windshield wipers.  How complicated can they be?  I'm assuming that when I turn them on, they will clear the windshield.  Mainly, I want to clear them from the list of items I have to review.
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.

Will buy again should I need them for something else.
I installed these on my 2003 Forest River Sunseeker 3100SS motorhome. I used a tiny piece of 5lb 2 way tape on the corner for added security. Works GREAT!  Been driving all summer with these and still there. Would recommend!Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!I had a set of these before but only the two ton. Needed another pair and these match up perfectly with dimensions for my 2-tons.
please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesThese are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these.

i recommend it to everyone who has a hi lift jack or something like, to buy this product. it fits very snug, hard to fall off. it does exactly what it is suppose to.These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanksExactly what it should be. Fits fine. Stops leakage. No way to tell how long it will hold up but it is fine now.
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Probably a good filter but didn't fit the application. Amazon made it right, but be sure this fits your car before buying.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM!I purchased this because it fits in the same bag that I keep my trailer ball mount in. This way I always have a lug wrench with me in case I get a flat tire on my trailer. It's a nice quality tool and one of the sockets fits my trailer lugs. Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it if you're looking for a space-saving way of carrying around a lug wrench.
I purchased this to plug the receiver hole on my 2012 Rubicon when not in use.  It fits perfectly and I really like the strap that is made onto it.  It keeps you from having to store it away and then try to find it later whenever you need to use your receiver hitch.Good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room. I use this on my ATV for the batt charger since I put a basket on it. Don't have to crawl under to hook it up.I use this in our travel trailer. It's a good fit on the counter, but the stand needs to be a bit taller to be able to slope the water toward the sink, so I end up propping the end up a bit. I don't use it for storing since it's an open grate on the bottom and don't want to chance spilling any detergent or soap during transit.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
I purchased this wheel lock punch for my newly acquired OEM wheel locks i purchased from Amazon. The only thing i hate about this pouch is that it is not made of the material depicted in the picture. It is made out of Nylon.This steering wheel cover is exactly what I was looking for.  Soft leather, and is very durable, and the stitching is very high quality.  I love the way this makes my interior look and the feeling is great.This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.
Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though.fits perfectly in  one side of the rv double sink.  Additionally can sit on the Tray and drain into the sink as well.Due to size does not hold many dishes but adequate for my useWorks just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
It is tough, and I don't know that it would be easy to destroy the lock mechanism, but the fit on the trailer tongue isn't great.  I haven't taken a hammer to it, but the ball is pretty small, and the top bar doesn't fit my trailer that well, so it feels a little looser than I would like.  It may be just fine, but I don't feel as good about it as I would if I couldn't wiggle it when it was tight.This would be a great idea if it actually wasn't too tall to fit inside our camper cabinets.  I measured this before ordering and thought it would fit.  But you really can't judge how your knives will fit in it from the description.  Most of our knives were too thick at the handle or too wide at the blade to sit down inside it fully.  Therefore they would stick up too high and would prevent the cabinet door from closing.  It was a waste and I didn't use it.I recommend instead buying a full knife set with holder and overall product dimensions, and doing some thoughtful measuring.I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.

just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didI truly don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. Take the guess work outta knowing weather your tires need replacing or will pass inspection. Can't go wrong with this one.I love Lynx products, these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do. I would buy again.
They are small, but they are sturdy and stand up well under the weight of the two front jacks of my trailer.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).

I have two of them now. The first one I bought about 7 years ago but it wast the tri-ball, so when I upgraded my trailer to the 2 11/16 I needed to buy a new ball.... Or buy another one of these with the triple balls then I would have another shank to mount on another vehicleI installed these on my 2003 Forest River Sunseeker 3100SS motorhome. I used a tiny piece of 5lb 2 way tape on the corner for added security. Works GREAT!  Been driving all summer with these and still there. Would recommend!I had two sets of jack stands but only 1 1/2 tin capacity and when I got my truck, I feel questionable getting under the truck. I know they share the weight but it only takes one to fail... So I ordered two pair of these 3 ton stands. They were securely packed in the box with cover and cushion. I love the double locking safety. Very good construction and ready for use. I highly recommend this product.

These tire irons are bigger than they appear to be. The description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones I received are 18 inches long from tip to tip and about 11.67mm thick (see pic). The thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won't bend. The end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim. These are well made and will last a long time.Overall the kit is pretty decent. The case is nice and touch and all of the leads and attachments work well. Will detail them out next. The main issue I have is that the kit is not exactly as shown/advertised.Carrying Bag:The included bag is a very nice heavy duty bag. It&#8217;s a tri-fold bag with 3 pouches sealed with very nice heavy duty Velcro. There is some extra room in at least 2 of the pouches to store additional wires while still being able to close the bag properly.Main Lead wires:The main leads are nice, each end includes a nice cap to keep them clean and free of debris. The lead wires are 18AWG and overall are very nice. They fit into my DMM perfectly and the attachments clip on easily as well except the alligator clips (details below)Test Probes:The test probes are nice, but larger than I expected from the product images. They double as banana clips which is a nice addition. They have plastic covers, that while on cover up the banana clip part leaving only the test probe tip exposed. Again this is nice to keep things well insulated when needed. The major issue I had was that the probes alone are much thicker than I had expected from the images and with the covers on they are even thicker. This doesn&#8217;t make them bad, just slightly misrepresented and not the best for smaller electronics work.Mini Hooks:The mini hook attachments are very nice they have a perfectly tensioned spring for smaller electronics work. The hook pops out easy and the tension from the spring is tight enough to keep it well attached but not too much as to bend wires. Overall these are very good attachments and work well with smaller electronicsAlligator clips:These are where my major complaint is, and the largest reason for the lower rating. The clips I received are nothing like what is in the product images. Please view the customer added image gallery sections full a full library of all of the products in this set. In that gallery you will see that the alligator clips included are very heavy duty. They are nice clips, but not what was shown to come with this set. They are hard to attach to the lead wires and are too large and strong to work with many smaller electronics products. If you try and remove the insulator boot you find that the clips are nice but the end is completely bare. This was a disappointment. Again please see the customer image gallery for detailsConclusions:Overall this is a good kit, and contains some good parts for small electronics but the test probes are larger that depicted and the alligator clips are miles away from what was expected to be with this kit. I would like to give this product a 4 or 5 start rating, as the products are not &#8220;bad&#8221; they are just not what was represented in the pictures and product info. This is a kit meant for larger electrician or automotive electrical work maybe. This kit is not the best for small electrics hobbyists. That said, the price may be low enough to be worth he bag and the couple parts that are good for the small electronics work.Please review the image gallery and determine if they will be worth the money.**If this review was helpful please click the button below**
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.I have this mounted on my pop-up trailer to keep the battery ready to go between trips 65 days camped in 2012
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.

The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2
Very nice filter media that fit directly into the old fixture that I pulled out from behind the glove box.  It literally took me 2 minutes and saved me $65.  2009 Accord - open the glove box and push forward on the clip on the right hand side of the open glove box, squeeze the glove box on the left and right in an inward direction and the box will drop down to expose the filter behind the glove box...so easy.  Reverse to re-installFirst perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.I cut the horn off the compressor. The horn will fit under the stock cowbell. The compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with 3 large zip ties. I ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire. The horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h3ll.  Many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
These work well.  Had to drill more holes because they are not a direct fit for the originals.  They look good.They do a dang good job but you have too order two I just assumed they were sold in pairs like socks ? Wrong I mean who buys just one wiper blade if they were made to fit a Ford super duty F350They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.These work great. Ordering on Amazon sure beats a trip to the auto parts store. If you want to be sure you're ordering the proper size, visit the Bosch website. They have sizing for all vehicles. Check your size over there, then come back to Amazon and order. I replaced my old Rainx wipers, and I got to say so far I like these better. No idea how long they will last, but they do seem to perform better.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at allWhen I stepped up to a 34 foot fifth wheel trailer my standard chocks looked undersized against the 16&#34; trailer wheels.  These fit the bill.  Nice and strong.

These snap on gutter extensions are a must for RV's that don't have them. They just snap on to the existing small gutter extensions supplied by the RV manufacturers.  Keeps those black streaks from forming on the side of your RV. I don't understand a reviewer who stated he's never seen them in 40 years of camping. We had them on our 2007 Jayco Eagle and now on our 2014 Cougar HC 321RES trailer. They are cheap- they work & they just snap on or off.Takes a lickin & keeps ticken.....I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them.I purchased two of these 20' ft heavy duty tow straps to leave in the back of my 2007 tahoe.  I have pulled multiple cars out of ditches with these straps. They are a life saver and not expensive.  I would have paid double for these.  These are a great emergency item to leave in the trunk of your car.  You never know when you will need them.

Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThese will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?
Can see the same welding issues as the other users, though I'm not sure if it would affect the maximum load (2 tons) the jack stands can hold. Sturdy jack stands, might be slightly high for some cars, depending on what you are trying to do (being too high isn't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more).Overall, simple no frills car jack stands. Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked, as well as the regular locking handle.I dont like the thick gel type dressing as they are prone to sling all over the side of the car.This product is thin enough that you can apply evenly using a simple foam pad.  I can achieve a nice natural finish, or very glossy by adding more product.What else can you ask for? 3 Ton and light weight plus locking mechanism is way safer than the wedge cuts in regular ramps.I suggest that they cover the top with a rubber pad or silicon piece to help protect car and stand
Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.Lazy As.

As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.perfect size and fit for changing automatic transmission fluid on an impreza holds about a quart and a half while it drips in
I wish the tool was about an inch longer. For a 1995 VW Jetta, with the tie rod inserted, I can't clip the wrench part in place because the tool is about a quarter inch too short. It's still usable but the wrench part won't clip in place so there's a lot more fumbling around.Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function.This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.

I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.

These shocks fit perfectly, and provided enough power to lift the hood without effort.  I would highly recommend them if they make a model for your vehicle.Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels.

these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the levelI have a 2011 Jeep Wrangler 2 door Rubicon and I installed the red velcro grab handles on the front roll bars, the red rear pillar grab handles in the back, and just installed the black grab handles to the windshield pillar.  All three of the options are great and serve a different purpose.  The handles are heavy duty, so it would take a lot to tear one of them.  I really like the red handles because they &#34;pop&#34; when you get in the Jeep, but I opted for the black handles for the front windshield so that it wasn't distracting while I was driving.I've had Husky liners in several vehicles and swear by their fit and longevity. Only drawback is the tread depth is not particularly great. While the sides are adequate for keeping any slush you drag in confined to the liner, sometimes (but certainly not all the time) your shoes will be sitting in the mud/slush/water. No big deal to pull em out and dump em, but could be perfect with even just another 1/4 inch of tread depth.Other than that, the plastic is of perfect ridgity to mold to the contours of your Jeep and the colors are steadfast for a very long time. Have both the front and rear liners in my JKUS.

This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.
I won't recommend this product. I have a compressor for my car (12V) and I bought this. It dosen't workI now have 4 Battery Tenders, this being my 2nd Battery Tender Jr.  I use the larger models for 2 cars I store each winter, and I use the Jr. models for my generator and my lawn tractor.  Easy to use and work great, I've not yet needed to replace a battery after a storage season.My son suggested I get the whole K&N system but I opted for the factory style replacement filter instead. O.K., I am cheap...lol.  I installed this in my 2010 f150 5.4 litre FX2. I keep the avg.mpg readout on in my dash. I average 17.4 and I don't drive it hard. After the filter, I average 18.1. I was shocked and I am very pleased with these results.

This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.Since they made this non flammable and tire sensor safe it doesn't seal as good as it used to, but still a good product.  Shake it up real good, pull out the nail or metal sticking in the tire first if there is one.  This won't seal a tire well if you leave the nail in there.  I carry two cans per car because I had a hose assembly break. Or,  keep the nozzle hose assembly off the top of the can for a spare.  This will seal some bead leaks, but not with the wheel mounted on the car.  Take the wheel off. lay it flat with the leaking bead side down, and slowly lift and lower the tire to get the stuff to the bead rim contact area.  Good for galvanized trailer tires which always seem to leak there.I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.Bought this to fill gear oil for Manual transmission in my Hyundai Elantra. The fill port on the elantra trans is on the fron of the housing and there actually is about 3-4 inches of clearence. The fill tube fit nicely in the hole for the transmission and filling was pretty effortless. My only gripes is as I was filling there was a constant drip from the fill hole and the hose bends easily. So not only is filling slowed down but I lost probably about 1/4 quart of oil down the front of the transmission.
Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.This is a great replacement bolt kit for your License plate mounts.  I personally did not need the grommets but the bolts were exactly what i needed.  Only negative is that the key for the bolts should have been grooved on both ends, as the groove is only on the tip of the long end leaving you to struggle with the short end of the key when the bolt gets really tight.  Advise using something like a Ratchet extender on it....I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.Well....It's a good ball.  It's a shiny ball.  Exactly what it's supposed to be.  Pulls a trailer.  Very tough.  Thanks.As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Fits perfectly, will not slip and 3/4 the price in an RV accessory store (same Thing).  Cleans off in a JiffyFits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderThis doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.
I love it. Can also use to leave vehicle outside so the BatteryMinder ( Tender ) stays dry in the garage, if it rains outside. A must have for me. I want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf, not under the hood in a hot engine bay.I bought this with a cold winter in mind, being in my car can be cold sometimes after I cut the ignition off waiting for someone.The switch went bad after a month of medium use (2-3 times a week).I have this cover on a Harley Road Glide and it fits well with the tour pak on or off.So far it has protected the bike well in medium rain showers, which is the most rain I have used it in.  I also use it to cover the bike when stored in a garage.It has a nice small bag and fits easily in my saddle bag taking up a small amount of space.
Used this during my Mazda Miata rebuild.Plan to keep in my toolbox in the future.The Good;Excellent product. It does workRelatively easy to use brush on underside of capHeatproofThe Bad;8 oz is probably more than I will use this lifetimeRequires a stir or two before use. Not a big deal, but worthy of noteI will buy againI had used this product before and was looking to purchase more. It is not available where I live so I had to order it online. This wax is a paste and is easy to apply with a slightly damp cloth or applicator. I am currently using it on my boat and cars. I would suggest working a smaller area to avoid the wax drying and becoming harder to remove. If you stay in a 2x2 or so section it is easy to put on and take off. It leaves a very slick surface and a good shine. If you use a carwash soap for cleaning, the wax will remain for quite some time. I have noticed it seems to hold up well on the boat in saltwater as well. That says a lot for anything in the Florida sun.I bought this for use on my black 2007 Chrysler 300C. Prior to this purchase I was using the detailer that came with the Mejuiar's Detail Kit, which is in the red bottle. The main reason I chose this one is the sprayer on the other bottle seemed to be defective. After purchasing three bottles in a row and having them all be defective I decided to try something else. I liked the product, just not the quality of the spray bottle.I know that's a weird reason to change, but I am glad I did. This is a superior product to the basic detailer. It cost a bit more, but it's worth it - although cheaper on Amazon especially with Prime's free shipping.I mostly use this after washing my car to give it a nice shine. Before using this product I often used a quick wax spray occasionally between normal waxing and then the detailer spray to remove any smudging the wax left behind. Using this product I no longer use the quick wax. This detailer does the job on it's own. Using a soft cloth you spray it on, wipe it off and buff. Leaves a nice glow on the black paint with hardly no effort. Works well on a warm surface too. I don't mean in the sun, but like after driving and the hood is still warm.I have also used it for a quick clean when the car has only a slight coat of dust that can be wiped off with a soft cloth prior to using the detailer. I wax my car at least once or twice a month so there is always a good coat of wax on the surface. I would not recommend using the detailer without washing first if your wax is no longer beading up when it rains.All that said, this is not a replacement for a good wax or spray wax for that matter. This is a finishing product that should be used on a surface that already has a decent coat of wax. Great for bringing out the best in an already clean waxed surface.Oh and the sprayer works much better too.
This was the coolest engine color ever used by a manufacturer. Pontiac used this color from 1966-1970 for both their V8's and straight 6's. Pontiac used other shades of blue through the years, though this blue stands out with the metallic flake. As the previous review notes, apply in thin coats, it goes on a lot easier if you do. You can apply normal coats anywhere there is casting but on flat surfaces you really need to apply light coats.If you're cleaning up or rebuilding a Pontiac motor, there's no law that says you have to paint it the correct blue for the engine/car's year. I'm using this color on a 77' 400, and the motor is going into a 1981 Trans Am!Don't forget to useDupli-Color DE1612 Engine primerfirst! This is especially important on non-course surfaces.Heads Up: Pontiac heads will eventually burn off the paint applied along the exhaust ports. From the past 2 years of car shows I've been to, I haven't seen a single Pontiac where the paint isn't burned off over those ports. The only thing I have seen that did work is someone used a cast iron exhaust manifold higher temp paint along the exhaust runners, which looked as if it was part of the exhaust manifolds. As far as I am concerned, these burned off spots are your tiger's stripes and they belong there if your a serious Pontiac owner!I have used my share of waxes and polishes on my vehicles and this is by far the best I have seen. It goes on very easily and comes off the same. No white stuff in the seams or on the black trim! Wish I had started using Ice sooner! Lasts for months outside in the weather and much longer if your vehicle is stored inside. The only product I've seen last a bit longer outside is the Harley Glaze, but you have to deal with the white caught in the seems etc. Highly Recommended.Love bugs in Florida, along with the other flying critters around are a real test for a product like this. Heck, you can saddle up and ride some of the insects that hit the windshield and front paint on your car, motorcycle, and motorhome!  Use this product and they all wash of with vertually no effort.  Works on the windshield glass without effecting wipers.  Cycle windshields become rain dispersing and clear as can be. Te front of my Camper looks like new.Use is after your clean the vehicle completely, do not use wax over it, and enjoy the results!  Oh, don't sit on your car hood after using this product, YOU WILL SLIDE RIGHT OFF!!!!
This product is a good value, and is a good tire shine product. No wiping needed. The price is reasonable, and it arrived well packaged.This is a must have for any RV owner.  It is a good size and accurate.  Love this thing!  Very well made.Although it should be included for free with the Jack this item is a must have and reasonably priced.  Careful it's also easily stolen.
great little gadget! No getting zapped anymore checking for spark or have the spark plug fall off the engine every time to pull the cord to check for spark!As you may know, one cause of the "check engine light" coming on your dash is lack of pressure in the fuel system due to a faulty gas cap.Normally, when the "check engine light" comes on, I go out and tighten the gas cap; if that's the cause, the light will go off in an hour or so.However, if the light stays on, a cheap option is to replace the gas cap - a lot cheaper than taking it to the shop and getting charged an hour of labor and the shop cost of a gas cap. In my state, a car with the "check engine" light on during the inspection period will fail the inspection.If you replace the cap, and the light still stays on, then take it to the shop.This is a good price on the cap.I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged.
does the job.It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims.
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLAlways make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.
When it works it works okay.But have to tap on it sometimes to get it to register. Makes me wonder how accurate it is...Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.Not sure how solid it is if someone actually attempted to break it.However, it feels solid enough and secure that it brings us peace of mind.

I'm not a fan in adding anything to the fuel system.  But I put in some bad gas and my car developed a rough idle.  This cleaner helped.  I've tried other brands that didn't do anything, so in that respect this product works.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.From what I can tell from my research, this contains the same ingrediants as in Techron.  I put in an ounce or two each time we fill it up somewhere that doesn't have Techron in their gas already (like Sam's & Costco).  We aren't consistant enough to know if it makes a difference in gas mileage or not, but my hope is that doing this prevents us from having to do a fuel system cleaning.
What can I say, it's a funnel.  Does the job as expected. Has a nice large fill hole so the liquids go in quickly.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.Keeps a 12 volt battery charged without frying it. Very compact and fairly priced. I like the fact that a carry pouch is included as well as a hard wired pigtail with an easy connect to the battery in question. Good for a motorcycle or airplane battery.

Great accessory for when you get stuck and need to lift just one wheel to perform a self recovery to get back on the trail/street.Had these in past years and then lost them somewhere.These things are perfect for frozen windows on cars.They get that ice off quick and do not harm the glass in any way.Amazon should be commended for offering these, you usually have to go to the auto supply shops to get these.Most times these shops in my locale don't have 'em on hand so you have to wait until they order them.Why not order them thru Amazon and get them with free shipping when enough items are ordered?Thank you Amazonneeded to order one smaller item to get free shipping, and have a motorcycle that will need an oil change soon, so it fit both needs

Makes seal very slick and shiney should do a great job protecting the rubber seals, dont know how long it will last untill it has to be reapplied, but will let you knowi tested it with another gauge and it gave an accurate reading . Make sure you keep it secure to the valve or it will leak air outI did not smell any sent of Fresh Breeze, the filter is thicker than the oem filter and hope it will last as long and will not restrict the air flow due to its thickness. So far it has not restricted the air flow after a few weeks but still never had a fresh sent.
To me? Grabage... the quality of this set has gone downhill IMO... I have an older set that rocks so I bought this newer set for another trailer - garbage.  Mismatched looking pins and locks. Hitch cover lock is plactic and doesnt hold well. I would recommend buying local so that you can try it and return it... Thank you AMAZON for allowing me to return this POG.these seem to be very good quality spreaders. I am going to buy another set to have on hand  in case i need them.I had to buy this from NAPA shops in past times and pay the full retail cost.Amazon now is offering this at a very competitive price and even has free shipping.That free shipping just involves getting enough items to get over the minimum limit which is really easy.So now I can get a product at a great price that I know works for me and get it delivered to my house for free.What more do you need?Thanks Amazon for  offering this item.
If you use a scan tool with live data readouts this is a must have. Worked right out of the package and seems to be a quality item.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.Makes changing the filter element a breeze.  Made in the US.  If you have your oil changed by an independent shop, take this along for the shop to use.  Toyota and Lexus dealers have this tool or one very similar.
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.This is a great little charger, especially for the price.  Simple hookup with the ring terminals on my motorcycle and the connector stays zip-tied to the subframe just below the seat.  Once connected the LED on the charger gives me status information at a glance so I can always tell when the battery is charging or sitting there maintaining a full charge.
.Car waxes seem to have a fair amount of sizzle and hype included at no extra charge.After using both products, I preferNu Finish Liquid Car PolishZymol is:* Much less durable than Nu Finish, according to Consumer Reports tests (Nov 2011)* About twice the cost (see Note 1)- Shelf life is not as good (see Note 2)If your time counts for anything, durability is a big deal. Same protection, fewer waxings.- - - Paste Wax Alternatives - - -These paste waxes are even more durable, according to the CR report.Nu Finish Paste Car PolishorTurtle Wax T-465 8 Oz Ice Polish Paste- - - Notes - - -Note 1: Amazon price for Nu Finish swings mostly between 7 and 11. Wal-Mart has it for about 8. This compares with about $16 for Zymol.There's an "Online Price Alert" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done. Or try camemcamelcamel.Note 2: Shelf life: I have bottles of Nu Finish and also Zymol from about 6 years ago. The Zymol is separated into grainy chunks and thin liquid -- hard to re-homogenize, but the Nu Finish is perfectly good.The results are the same you would get with similar products from other brands. The shine stays for a few days only. The bottle, however, looks way better than those of competing products.While this fuel system cleaner is pricey compared with many others, it has the highest amount of poly-ethyl-amine (PEA) and as a result it has a very bad smell. However, it is the best fuel cleaner on the market, and I use it every oil change. This is cheaper and is at least equivalent to the other popular fuel system cleaner by Amsoil. It is also about 3x stronger than regular Techron, and it's about the same price when on sale. Excellent product, 5 stars.
So many people who clean their own cars never clay (most never heard of it).  It's so simple to do, just once every few months do a clay of your car. This kit is great, because it includes a bottle of Quik Detailer. You spray the Quik Detailer, rub the clay, and *bam* watch your car shine.If you want to save money, you could just buy the clay seperately and use some sort of liquid.  Clay does require a liquid application in order to work.  But if you just want to save hassle and get it all in one shot, do this.  Then you can figure out how to save money after you've got the hang of claying.I've smog problem on my old car, after trying this products, its solve out the problem and pass the smog check. Save time and money to go through mechanic to fix it before you can get the smog pass before you fix the engine. Is Work.I use several different SCHUMACHER CHARGERS and though some are over 8 years old and in CONSTANT USE ,maintaining and charging batteries ,they have yet to fail to do a great job . I do blow the dust out of them every few months to help them run cooler and wipe them clean once in a while.These lightweight chargers do heavyweight work. You just set the battery TYPE and AMPERAGE that you want to limit ...then let the charger do the job...it will charge automatically and then go into a MAINTENANCE MODE so as to not over-charge your battery .
I must have misunderstood how this siphon works. I have never been able to get it work at all. I have tried every possible method  and no luck. I understand how gravity works but apparently this device doesn't. If you get it to work, more power to you.I don't know how many chock I have damaged so far due to the cheap quality. This one will not break even if I drive over it. Recommended a must for everyone.Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.
Really cool thing, it is digital so it doesn't matter where you put it, my electric recommended to put it in the middle under console so if someone will try to lift your car it will sense it instantly, because if you put it on one side and the car will be lifted from the other side it might not sense it. But then another electric came and said that it is digital sensor so it doesn't matter where to put it, finally they put it where it was easier for them :) even though I was asking them to put it in a middle as first one recommended in the beginning.And don't worry about parking your car on the hill - it will remember it is position once it is armed and won't trigger alarm, may be old gyroscope based ones were making triggering the alarm.We tested it then, lifted car from the other side and you had to lift your car about 3&#34; before alarm got triggered by this tilt sensor. I was joking that tires are already stolen because for me 3&#34; were to high and expectations were that it will trigger instantly once car lifted more than 1&#34;. But hey, not always you can force your electrics to do what you want them to do.As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do.I got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side .
Another of the must haves for RV-ing, If you don't have it when you need it, you will be sorry.'If you own a Hi-Lift, I may suggest to have this repair kit. You don't know when you will have to use it.Needed for the 2010 Toyota Sienna.  I tried some others and they don't allow you to take off the canister.  This is necessary if you want to change your own oil.
Connections still tend to drip no matter how tight you make the clamps. Nothing beats a &#34;good hose&#34; with factory installed ends that don't leak.  This is used on my hose of last resort when I just can't reach the sewer drain. I hate dripping contaminated water anywhere, even if it is just grey water.This is a good size to buy and is enough oil to service a filter several times. The K&N oil has red dye in it so you can see when you have achieved full coverage. Great filters that when maintained, one filter will last as long as the car will last. Catches dirt better than the paper filters. The K&N filter gave my truck a slight increase in acceleration. When I removed a new clean paper Fram filter and put the K&N in, I took it for a road test. On a dry asphalt road, straight line acceleration from a stop, my truck broke the tires loose every time. Put the Fram back in as a test and it was again not quite able to do it. Put the K&N back in and again it was able to break the tires loose every time. Never quite had enough power to do that before. Not a huge difference but a difference none the less. When you clean your K&N be sure NOT to use hot water while cleaning. Hot water can make the filter shrink in places, causing it to become uneven. After cleaning and recoating with the oil. Mine still looks just like a new one. I put the K&N in while the truck was almost brand new and now it has 234,000 miles on it in 13 years. Same air filter and the engine has never been apart. The engine absolutely has wear, but no smoke yet and still runs good.I used a turkey baster with measure to take out 16 oz of my coolant then filled radiator back with Purple ice. after a test run around the neighborhood, i touched the coolant hoses and they were HOT, i had no thermometer with me but i check up on the temperature constanly after i do work on my Pathfinder, and the hoses were way hotter then normal. Now this might be counter productive thinking but it makes sense. By having the Coolant increase its temperature, that increase in temperature is going to be direct with the decrease in temperature in the engine block as the coolant's heat transfer ability increases. I have no numbers as of yet, but i know for a fact, this product works even if it might be for 10 or 15 degrees, and for such a low price, Purple Ice has my recomendation.
It is exactly as it is advertised. It seems well built. If this is what you need just buy it.This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.At this price I could not pass it up. This is what is recommended my car manufacture (hyundai). The Gasoline direct engines build carbon very fast and need fuel cleaner every oil change.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.
(OK, I give . . . after being beat up with thinly veiled accusations of being sexist, I have edited my review using parenthetical modification to try and make it less offensive to all readers).High quality super-soft microfiber.  Excellent for cleaning and drying without leaving behind water-spotting or scratches.  Use on prized exterior paint and in the interior also, with or without a detailing spray.Really, you might want to buy an extra pack for your wife (or life partner or yourself).  They are just as useful inside the house for dusting fine-finish furniture, or computer/audio equipment that you (or your wife or life partner) don't want to scratch, like dark glossy plastic surfaces.My towel/chamois collection have now been demoted to wiping up motor oil spills (or spaghetti or fondue dip or baby food spills).  Try a pack.P.S.  I'm adding this comment after using these for well over a year:  They are holding up well.  I (or my wife or life partner) launder them as needed.  They accumulate permanent dirt stains of course, but still work as well as new.  No holes or falling apart yet.These weigh next to nothing and take up little space, but they really work to keep your vehicle from rolling while you're working beneath it.  Just try to drive off having forgotten to remove them . . .I purchased the 18" Anco Winter blade because I needed a good wiper for my primary winter vehicle a 1994 Ford Bronco 4x4.  What's the use of 4 wheels in the snow if you can't see where you're going?  These blades proved to be excellent!  I was amazed, especially since I was reluctant to purchase these seeing as the "normal" anco blades haven't held up for me very well over the years.  I put them on right before either the first snowfall of the year or before it gets really cold.  No sense busting your knuckles, especially when its 0 degrees outside when the pain seems to multiply 10 fold.  lol.  I bought a set end of 2010, took them off when the weather improved and switched them to my "summer blades" and I just recently put the same set of winter blades from last year back on.  Tested them out, still work like new!  What is nice about these blades is the fact that they do not stiffen up with the extreme cold and they do not form ice on them when you use your windshield washer like the metal ones do.  We all know its a pain and dangerous bashing your wipers against your windshield just to get them working right again.  Which these seem to eliminate.  I would recommend them to anyone who has to drive in adverse cold weather conditions.Tips:Put them on before it gets cold/snowy.  No sense waiting until last minute and suffering!If they still work, SAVE THEM!  Use them only when needed through the winter season.  I stored mine in the garage through the summer.If you save them, wipe them down with a towel or cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol before putting them on.  This cleans off road grime and restores them to maximum performance.  A lot of reviewers complained about streaks, etc.  Unless the blade is physically damaged this can be fixed by doing so.If for whatever reason in extreme cold they do freeze, don't bang them and definitely do not try picking or scraping the ice off of them.  This will damage them for sure.  What I do is take some prestone windshield deicer and carefully spray them down a little.  Works wonders, just watch your paint.
This steering wheel cover is exactly what I was looking for.  Soft leather, and is very durable, and the stitching is very high quality.  I love the way this makes my interior look and the feeling is great.great tool to have, makes the job much easier. the design is ergonomically right. the price is right also. it is made with quality workmanshipExactly as described. Super easy installation. Material is durable and appears color fast. I am very satisfied with this product.
Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased.One down side, bottles can and will fell off due to the fact of the design. Adjustable arms cannot hold a &#34;full heavy&#34; 16oz water bottle ...... those arms spread easier than a _________ legs.I actually got'em glue with epoxy using a coke bottle as standard measure; be careful not to glue'em to wide apart or the lid wont close.I really like this charger. You can select the settings for normal, deep cycle, and AMG batteries. You can select small or large batteries. You can set the reading to watch between volt reading or % of charge. Great product for the money!
Just a smidge of this product will turn a once tarnished nasty piece of aluminum into a beautiful shine that you wouldn't believe. Really you can see your reflection in the surface after polishing it up. Will always purchase Mothers Mag and Al polishThis treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project.stellar product for polishing, cleaning and keeping the bike looking great. She works on the engine, paint, fiberglass, plastic, chrome and anything else on the bike. DO BE CAREFUL SPRAYING ON THE SEAT OR TIRES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND. This product doesnt come off too easily and will spread with heat. If you spray on the tires or seat it will look great but your butt and the bike will slide everywhere.
I purchased 1 of these to tow my 16 ft camper from Northern New England to Florida this past Spring. You can buy 2 of them and use them for extra protection. I didn't need to do more than 1 as my camper is about 1600 lbs...It took me some driving and stopping to ask others why I didn't feel my sway bar was working to understand I was using it wrong.I had the sway bar to tight. The handle is very easy to turn and you can feel when it gets taunt. Over tightening it will defeat the purpose of using this item. It is NOT a stabilizer bar..it's a sway bar.. took me a while to get it...I prefer to have the sway bar for my small camper..plus it's easy to remove or even loosen..which you really have to do to turn around in tight spaces. The thing will screech as you turn! The sway bar is sup to allow your camper to do some sway just not very much sway. if you over tighten it, it will not work properly..when the wind hits you, both the camper and the car will feel the pull back and forth.. you don't want that.. you want the camper to be able to have some sway with the wind. This product is great because you can adjust the amount of tension for low winds/high winds. GREAT PRODUCT!I bought this to maintain my motorcycle battery through the winter. Have ever experienced the time, and I am sure your have, when the weather nerd was wrong? It was supposed to be nice for your ride to and from work, the cold front with near freezing rain came rolling in 12 hours early, you didn't quite have the battery fully charged before you left because it would charge enough while you rode, then you got stopped by every red light on the way to work for a 10 hour shift, your bike sits 6 hours in 30 degree weather, and you come out only to hear the starter relay just click? Then your fingers are frozen and numb, and you are trying to get the tools out so you can open the cover where the battery is so you can jump it off with a car, when the rubber strap (the one that has many names) that holds the tool bag in finally pops loose and slaps you in the knuckles? Then this is the one thing a biker (or anyone with a car, truck, snowmobile that they use only occasionally) needs to keep the battery in top condition to avoid part of the scenario. It is easy to hook up, keeps the battery topped off, saves your battery, saves your knuckles, allows the people in the parking lot NOT to hear your extensive vocabulary, and is easy to use.Disclaimer:I cannot make claims to it being able to control or predict the weather, but then again neither can those college educated nerds... though some of those weather ladies can get away with anything in my book :-)I hope this review helps.I use it on every wash that I do.If your a car guy and keep your vehicles nice this is a great product.If your working on a vehicle that has been abused it may take you two or three times to get the wheels looking good.You may have to scrub the wheels by hand to clean off the real dirty areas, and possibly use tar and or bug remover to get them nice and clean.But once you do that, from there in all you need to do is wash the wheels down, spray the wheel cleaner on and let it sit for a few minutes and pressure wash it off. No need to hand wash.And the wheels look really nice.
This is the kind of spark plug gapper / gap tool you should use when gapping Iridium spark plugs. Simply wonderful.This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation. Great valuie.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.
The door catches on a toy hauler will wear out over time, whether from sun damage or excessive use, etc. These are a great thing to have on hand for the times this happens. Easy, two screw install...should fit directly over the existing door catch holes on most RV's.Used this grease on all metal contact points as suggested while replacing the brake pads.  Basically apply it on shims, where caliper cylinder the back of brake pad to prevent squealing noise while breaking.  I also use 3M silicone for the slider pins.This is a great product. Has special coating on filter to prevent mold from developing on it. Keeps in car air clean and prevents it from smelling bad.
Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased.Works really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored.If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI.
Hi All.I'm an RV'er, and have been for over 46+ years now.  So I am always looking for something for our Motorhome.  Having this adapter is great when you have Power, and you want to run 12 Volt items.  I'd buy another one in a second it needed.  Good Luck.  Happy Travels.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.Haven't used it yet, but i checked that it fits. I hope I can easily get the filter off to do my own changes. They shipped it to APO, which is always a good thing. I bought this because a regular oil filter wrench doesn't work that well on this style of filter.
I use this in place of the PL14612 filter spec'd for my Subaru and Nissan cars. This is slightly longer, the equivalent of a &#34;7317&#34; instead of &#34;6607&#34; Fram sized filter, and it works perfectly. The longer filter lets me run a full 5qts of oil in each car, instead of 4.75.Great to stop small leaks!It's a standard black silicone in a tube instead of a can.Silicone gets rubbery hard.Squeeze, and apply. Works like expected!This is a fairly cost effective solution compared to a full on board air system. It took the pump about 3 minutes to reinflate each 33" tire after airing down to about 12psi. Kit comes complete and hooks directly to the battery.
I bought this pump because the seller described it as a siphon pump and I wanted to drain the gas out of my boat's gas tank.What I got,was a gas pump that does not siphon gas.I guess it might work for filling a lawn mower from a gas can.It is cheap and worth about five dollars.Wow! this product really works! It saved my neck, and stopped the rear main seal leak in my 01 Dodge Intrepid. Following what Scotty Kilmer recommended I just added the full bottle into my engine oil and took my car for a drive for several hours. Left it over night to do it's "magic"  The next morning the leak was still leaking but less then before.... After several days the leak was sealed and no more leaks. I will put another update after 6 months (when i do an oil change im going to add another bottle to full seal the leak). But this isn't a product that will seal right away takes time just like a wound would when you put a bandage on it.I usually replace my cabin filter once a year. This filter works great!!! Sure it doesn't filter 100% of fumes, but there is a noticeable diifference compared to a non charcoal filter. This takes less than 5 min or less to change on my 02 Audi A4 once you know how to do it. You won't find this filter cheaper anywhere else. The first time I changed my cabin filter it was full of leaves and a mouse nest! So happy I decided to puchase this.
After reading several reviews on this product I have to agree with most comments in regards to the locking fuel cap being poorly made. The Cap fits fine for the application. However the key mechanism is flimsy at best. The quality of the plastic components are not what I remember a Stant Locking Fuel cap to be. They def cheapened out on their manufacturing process`s.I gave the Stant Locking Fuel cap a 3 star rating only bc it does fit and is doing what the intended use is for. I do feel that if someone wants to remove the cap by force, they absolutely can. I primarily purchased this product based on Stant`s reputation in the Auto market, but this one leaves myself a bit disappointed. This is being used as a deterrent to help prevent vandals from pouring anything foreign into the tank. It does operate correctly when following the unlocking/locking procedures.Below is an answer from Bosch when I asked about the Marathons sold at Wally world. They are the same as Evolutions. They are not Bosch's higher end flagship Icons as some people suspected. If you like the Evo's you can save some cash by buying Marathons instead.I cannot personally testify about anything except the Icons witch are fantastic blades. Its the only line I have used. I think the only advertised difference is the longevity between the Icon/Evo lines but if wally worlds price for the Evo equivalent Marathons are low enough on my next trip around I'll try them. There does however seem to be better reviews on Amazon with Icons but I was just glad to find wipers that lasted yrs again instead of just months like other brands ended up doing for me. Hope I helped save a few bucks for someone here.BTW: When installing these beam blades make sure the higher ridge on the frame is up. You should be able to read Bosch. If Bosch is upside down then flip the blade around. While looking at the end the blade, its like a scoop to catch air. It should appear like this ( and not backwards like this ). The higher ridge acts like a spoiler on the rear of a car and catches wind to force it downward onto the glass while driving. I read on some reviews were people discovered they mounted them backwards and the blade lifted instead.===Question to Bosch===Are the Bosch Marathon wipers sold at Walmart stores the same blade as bosch Icons? If not what line are they from because they are not even listed on the bosch site?Thank you======Answer==Hello,The Marathon wiper blades are equivalent to the Evolution wiper blade.  They are not listed on our website because they are exclusive to Walmart.Thank you,Robert - Bosch Parts Specialist-----Original Message-----From: mailgenerator {at} de.bosh [mailto:mailgenerator}Sent: Tuesday, December 11, 2012 4:55 PMTo: Communications bosch (RBNA/COM)Subject: Request from Contact functionWhen I received Heininger 1020 CommuteMate "Flameless Flare", I had high hopes... real flares can be dangerous, messy, and difficult to use. I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down. I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say, I was rather disappointed. The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED. In the daylight, the light output from the flare is barely noticeable. At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention. Or, if you were using it on a dark trail, it might be visible from a short distance. But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door. The light is also uni-directional (only coming from one side of the flare), so careful positioning would be a must. I think it would be tricky to use as a map light, too, since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said, I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself. It is re-usable, and it could function as a secondary warning marker. It is not flammable, and it came with batteries which seems rare these days. The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good, if most vehicles were made of steel. But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light, it might be acceptable. One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a "failsafe". After all, the more lights the better. However, the idea that it would serve as a "flare" is just not correct. If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road, for example, I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights. I would expect something MUCH brighter for an application such as that, and given that expectation this product unfortunately fell short of both its name and purpose.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.The site recommended a large for my VTX1300C, it fits, it is snug, wont work with wind screen or saddle bags, but wont blow off in a stiff breeze
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.Bought for an APO address and free shipping, couldn't beat it. When you twist off the bottle cap the remaining ring easily falls off, so be careful if you pour directly into your oil reservoir, don't want the plastic ring falling in with the oil. But use a funnel and you won't have the problem. Will buy again.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.

I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater, as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location.  If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense, let me save you the time -- in my case, the better part of an afternoon.First, a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play: 1) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater, 2) a secondary plug that screws into the first, and 3) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water.  I believe the intent of this design is to allow &#34;regular&#34; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve, while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly (due to the larger diameter).  Sidenote: opening the actual valve (the smallest component) drains the tank very, very slowly, and sometimes only at a trickle if you can't get air behind the water -- in my case, I had to open the pressure relief valve (in addition to all faucets) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking, the other components did.  I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape, and at various depths.  No matter what the combination, there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces.  There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking.  I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape (5+ wraps), to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering, returned the valve to Amazon, and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug.  Hint: Sears sells a 15/16 offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs.If you plan on traveling off-highway and transporting extra fuel, this makes transferring fuel from gas can to tank very easy.  I leave my gas cans mounted on the vehicle and transfer the fuel using this hose.  Saves time, avoids spills, and keeps my hands clean!  No more lifting those 40-pound cans and standing there waiting for them to drain!The way this works is simple.  There is a valve in the end of the hose that acts as a pump to prime the hose with fuel.  This enables you to siphon fuel without having to suck the fuel into the hose, which would be unpleasant at the very least, and potentially harmful at the worst.I insert the hose into the bottom of my 5 gallon fuel can, "jiggle" the hose until the fuel starts to flow, and then stand by while the fuel empties into my Jeep fuel tank.  The only requirement for this to work is that the bottom of the hose in the supply side be higher than the other end of the hose emptying into the destination side.I've had mine for years and it has never let me down!I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.
Top 3 rated oil filters:  Amsoil, Mobil1, and  K&N.  You cannot go wrong with this filter as it is part of the top rated group.  If you want to do more research go to [...]just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didSome of the best oil I have ever bought for my Harley!! It runs about 10 to 20 degrees cooler then any other I have tried. You spend as much as you do on a motorcycle these days you want the best you can to put in it!!
If you wanna park in the same spot every time this is the product you need. Buy it, you can't go wrong.If you wash your car with a bucket, there is no reason why you should not have one of these at the bottom of your &#34;dirty water&#34; bucket! If you don&#34;t know what I am talking about then move on this isn't for You!Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter.
I was left stranded on the border of Oklahoma and Missouri late one night during the week - all because my battery cable was loose and my battery ended up being drained. My dealer recommended I purchase this if I don't ride everyday. While I suppose the loose nuts/cables on my battery cause my issue, I definitely love the peace of mind this little guy gives me.I plug it in when I know I won't be riding the bike for a few days and it's off my mind. I don't have to think about it and that's what is so cool.Sometimes, I question the initial red light when I plug it in (especially after having just ridden my bike for many, many miles). But, when I get ready to hop on the bike and see that green light shining at me, I know my ride will be trouble-free (as far as the battery goes).Personally, I used the 'permanent' hook-ups provided that basically bolts to your battery connections. The extension that stays on your bike tucks away nicely and plugs back in quickly. I don't think I'd want to fart around with the alligator clip option, simply because it's too many extra steps.I'm one of those anal guys who researches most of his purchases, even on small things like wiper blades. Unfortunately, I did not do that when I first replaced the blades on my Nissan Xterra. I replaced the stock ones with something the guys at Napa Auto recommended. During the first winter with them, they behaved as most wiper blades do - poorly. They chattered and squealed when the window wasn't drenched and left streaks or skipped when it was pouring. Like I said, they behaved like most blades. All this despite the fact that I keep the window - and blades - very clean.So this year, after another couple of months of sub-par performance and the scares that sometimes accompany a wet windshield, I decided to look for the the 'best blade'. I read reviews and asked questions on forums and this blade kept coming up. Now that I have it, I can see why.No noise - no matter how wet or dry the window. No skipping or sliding allowing water to remain behind. This thing, while still just a windshield wiper, is truly amazing. Yep, costs twice as much. No idea how it will hold up over the long haul, but I tend to replace blades once a year anyhow. Seriously, if you value the ability to see out of your windshield during torrential downpours or just drizzle - these things are the premier product.I have found few RV camp sites to be level. I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well. I always feel like the trailer is leaning when I walk around in it.With this bullseye level, I can place it on the trailer tongue or on the trailer floor as I do my leveling. I can quickly do the leveling with confidence. When I am done, I slip the bullseye in a drawer where it will be safe for my next trek.
I have had no problems with the functional use of this connector.  I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.  If you can't find Safari Charlie, I'd recommend trying an electrical contact cleaner or conductive contact grease like what is used on trailer harness connectors.  Any auto parts store should have those.I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it.I purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first.
have not in stalled this product yet but looks like it will do exactly what i need it to do.Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.I truly don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. Take the guess work outta knowing weather your tires need replacing or will pass inspection. Can't go wrong with this one.
Great hydraulic oil. Quality comes in an entire package. This includes the container, the pouring spout and the way the spout can be retracted with the cap on for storage. One can is enough to flush and refill the entire power steering unit.j After changing the fluid, my power steering is noticeable smoother and quieter. Very pleased with the performance of the product.This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the "frequently bought together deal" including the 6.5" finishing pad and the 6.5" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7" pads are actually machine washable.  The Velcro pad is attached far more securely.  The older 6.5" pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0"  or this older 6.5" pad, it's just that Meguiar's has improved and updated their pads now.  The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad, that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0" pad a no-brainer.  Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.Here are the links for the newest and improved pads:SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inchMeguiar's W 9207 7" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad
I would recommend these towels.We use them, and microfiber is one towelthat won't put scratches and swirl marks in a paints finish.All microfiber works well but low price towels may notresult in the best quality product.If you buy cheap you get cheap, and my car deserves the best.Show Car Guys 3 - Pack Of Ultra Blue Plush Microfiber Towels 16" x 16 "- At 360 GSM, This Is One Of Our Best Microfiber Cleaning Cloths-It Has Ultra Plush Micro Fiber Material On One Side, And The Other Side Consists Of Medium Terry Microfiber Material.Great quality, heavy duty with secure center. Should never bend or have the center piece come separate from the body. Fits perfectly on my Honda oil filters. Much better than the standard ones in auto parts stores. Would definitely buy again.Very heavy duty plastic and solid construction.  These work as advertised (using on a 16 foot 2700 pound travel trailer with 24&#34; tires).
This stuff is easy to use, and really works well. Anybody that is a car nut, will use this stuff, and for good reason, it's a great product.Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too.It works good for what it is suppose to do. No complaints dynamat is always a good brand but it was a little overpriced I would say You could probably find a make-shift one cheaper. Works great but you're paying for the name.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.There are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare. It will last much longer, and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car.  The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining. It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it isn't anywhere near as bright as a flare. It has a single LED that is very directional. If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P. Logue, 2010Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror.
This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.Replaced my Suburban Anode with this one. Fits correctly and is a good replacement at a cheaper cost. Why pay more.Update: I've used this for the season. It been working great.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless.This fits my 2004 Lexus RX330 perfectly. IMHO I feel that thisplain paper is superior to "carbon" type filters. How long can athin sprinkling of "carbon" last? Plus you can easily see howdirty the filter actually is and replace accordingly.  A good value.
I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).
I use it on a 17 foot Boston Whaler.  I connected it directly to the battery so I can use spot lights, other lighting, charge cell phones, etc.  Can't get any simpler.  Basically a piece of useful junk.  Recommend it.I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.I used this wax on my Platinum Gray VW and the surface had a near perfect mirror reflection.  I will continue to use this wax
I tried this on my Exterior Black sidings and bumpers and it doesn't last long.  But on the interior black this product works well.  It keeps my interior black and new look.  I gave this an OK product but not really impressed with it.  Let's see how long my interior look last on this Black to Black product.  But for now it's an OK product.Used this as an upgrade to my shadow ace short oil filter. Was looking for an economical oil filter but not compromising on performance. This has a trusted name on it, well made and a great alternative.This stuff works surprisingly well for no more effort that is required for applying it. Just spray and go, there's no wiping needed. It has done an outstanding job brightening up the black textured surface of the engine on my Harley Davidson Night Rod Special. I've also used it on faded black plastic door handles, mirrors and latches which it made it look brand new again. It is a little pricey, but it is definitely worth every penny.
Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look!When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it!This product is an effective way to remove dust and pollen in between car washes. I have used it for several years without any problems, and recently bought a new one to replace the one that got ruined in Hurricane Irene this past summer (my garage was flooded). Here is why I like it:1. This cleans without harming the car finish or leaving streaks.IMPORTANT: Follow the directions to place this on newspaper for 48 hours before first use. That is to get rid of excess wax that can cause streaking.2. This covers a large area, so the time to clean is reduced.3. This is easy to clean (just shake it out) and works great no matter how dirty it gets.4. This is well made and durable.Note: This is not a substitute for going to a car wash or using other cleaners. It does nothing, for example, to remove water spots or bird droppings. It also does nothing to give your car the shine that only wax can do. But it is a great way to maintain your car in between car washes.
I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter.If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations, this is it. If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it. Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt. Its going to shine. Great automotive or household maintenance product.
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost.I used this on my 97 Miata during a complete engine rebuild;The Good;Excellent product, from reports (although not mine personally) one of the best synthetic oils out thereFully SyntheticBottle is easy to use and avoid spills. (I also used a screw-in pump. I recommend you do too)Ships PrimeThe Bad;It can be pricey for what it is.I would use this in any performance car. I do not use it in my Daily Driver (Chevy Suburban with 150k miles)I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.Used this before & it cleans good. You don't need to over do it with the oil. Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying.
I've got a sport bike that doesn't have any storage.Before, I had a smaller disc lock made by someone else, but the internals on it always locked up - even when I had the key.So, I got this one, wanting something better.This one is too big to mount in the little spot I had before.It came with a little nylon carry bag, and I tried mounting that to the motorcycle, but it didn't stay. I took it off before it fell off and I lost the lock.Now, if I plan to go somewhere that I want to lock up the motorcycle (Wal-Mart or some sketchy bar), I will tuck this into the pocket of my riding jacket if I remember it. The problem is, I have never remember it.I've never gotten any use out of it, yet there it sits: Brand new and never flawed.Would I buy this again NO. Here's why . I missed it but no where do they say these are Sheep skin. I may be wrong but suspect this one I got is domestic goat skin. A smaller one I bought I have no doubt is Pig Skin. Since they are made in China this has made me really compare and check them closely, since most Chinese products are inferior quality.  First the package has 4 LARGE STAPLES that go through the skin Every layer) and if you don't open these CAREFULLY you will tear it, since they double back on themselves. Some reviewers report holes developing when used and I can believe that.  Second no where does this company say it is lamb or sheep skin, which leads me to believe it probably is pig or domestic goat skin, or horse hide. Is it going to scratch my new cars paint or hold up long? Good question. I also bought the 2 foot one and have no doubt it's not sheep or lambs skin. I'll review it later and probably will never use it on my car paint since I fear it will scratch the new Clear Coat paint. The 5 foot one is thin enough and buffed fairly well, so its soft.  But I have the ACME Brand made in Turkey also (same sizes) and those have instructions to wash with a mild soap to remove excess cod oil before using, (that's normal) and when you do you will see the excess oil. (I use mild bar hand soap) These Detailer's Choice ones don't tell you that and if you compare them you can see a difference in the amount of oil used when looking at them unwashed. (AS an aside the Chinese made chamois have had import restrictions place on them in Europe due to the inferior quality, deceptive advertising, etc. But not those from Turkey) Both of the Detailer's Choice leather skins are cut nice and rectangular, which shows they come from a large skin. Now I don't often write negative reviews but check what I'm saying by researching on the net . If I had done that first I would never have bought these. Yes I could return them but after deducting the return fee and shipping it isn't worth it. I think of this mistake as a lesson learned and would not recommend these nor buy them again. Other negative reviews are probably right on the mark.ADDENDUM:  After writing this review while showing these to my wife I laid them on a dark bedspread.  MISTAKE; since they left a ton of hide lint behind on it, (had to vacuum). So I washed them with hand soap and water in a sink and couldn't believe the amount of hide lint in the water. Washed them twice then rinsed them three times and was still getting a large amount of hide lint coming off. My wife saw that and said,"No way are you using those on my car."  Haaa So my next step is to hang them out side after drying and use a water hose to try and stop the lint problem. I'm 69 years old and have used both synthetic and natural Chamois for years and have never seen anything to match this. With that much lint coming off no way to wax after use. Another negative reviewer rated them as a POS and believe he has that right. Never would buy again nor recommend to anyone. Hope this helps someone not to make a mistake.The fuel that is made these days is crap, sure it will run in your wifes car or your truck OK. BUT put it in a chainsaw ,generator,tiller,boat or other smaller, LESS USED, MOTOR and the gasoline with alcohol (and what else?) attracts water and really gunks up the carb on these things that you gotta have. Then you have to take it to BUBBA and have him fix the carb BEFORE you can use the thing you NEED NOW! I have used other fuel stabilizers in the past ,but this stuff sure had some great recommendations and I believe that my boat and generator are running BETTER after adding some of this to the fuel...I haven't tried the chainsaw yet,it wouldn't run...yea,it's at Bubba's. But ,with luck, AND STAR TRON, that's the last case of beer he gits from me.
If you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is, always non-functional.  this conncetor works and holds the flat 4 wire firmly.This clip holds my EZ-pass perfectly and it is easy to switch vehicles if I want (unlike the Velcro strips).  Once placed on the windshield on clean glass it stays in position.  My car has been really hot in the summer and the suction cups have held.  Putting the clip behind the rearview mirror keeps it hidden and I don't even notice it when driving.Does a really nice job of collecting dirt and grit at the bottom of the bucket so it stays there and not back on your vehicle. Fits nicely into any standard 12&#34; bucket.
These are lightweight universal mats--nothing special.  I use them on top of the OEM mats in my car to protect the OEM mats.These work great to keep the stuff on the shelves in the refer or in the cabinets.  A must buy.These are so useful that I just keep buying more. Great in the fridge, great in the cabinets, Book ends, you name it. Sideways, upright or cockeyed in the bathroom cabinet. Helps things stay where you want them.
I have this on my 27ft TT.  It fits the latch nice and secure.  I would reccomend this to anyone needed a little protection.I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.This strainer works, but can't fit even full size plates! It also is very flimsy. I would find another one!
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
I bought this with a cold winter in mind, being in my car can be cold sometimes after I cut the ignition off waiting for someone.The switch went bad after a month of medium use (2-3 times a week).I had two Delco batteries die after  four year period of five years in my low mileage Corvette.The battery fits perfect and the red top looks great in my red Corvette.The car turns over faster than it ever did,even after sitting for a few weeks.I hope that it lasts more than a few years.If it does not,I will add to the review.A few months ago love bug season was in full swing so I applied it to the front of the car being I had just waxed it.Anyway I went on a short night trip, the next day I had bug guts all over my bumper, they removed just using strong was pressure from the tap.The bugs can't stick to the finish once the Ice is applied.My car is black and have no problems with streaking , tip, use just a little, don't let it dry too long, if you follow these steps you'll have no issues to speak with.I've used it a few times and the bottle is still 3/4's full.
Used this grease on all metal contact points as suggested while replacing the brake pads.  Basically apply it on shims, where caliper cylinder the back of brake pad to prevent squealing noise while breaking.  I also use 3M silicone for the slider pins.These are awesome for the times when you have to put some leveling blocks under the tires on one side of your RV. In the past I wasn't really able to chalk that side of the camper once on leveling blocks. With this I can. It also helps keep the RV from rolling moving around when you are inside. Highly recommended.I needed this in order to drain the waste tanks on our RV in case I wasn't able to do so on way home from a trip (or removing antifreeze from tanks in the Spring).  It twists on fine, makes a good seal to the drain fitting, and the hose outlet fitting does end up on the bottom so almost no liquid is left inside when draining is done.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.

The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good LuckI use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.
This fits my 2004 Lexus RX330 perfectly. IMHO I feel that thisplain paper is superior to "carbon" type filters. How long can athin sprinkling of "carbon" last? Plus you can easily see howdirty the filter actually is and replace accordingly.  A good value.The mk4 Beetles have a dashboard made of a ridiculous rubber/plastic material that gets sticky when the sun heats it up.  Why VW chose to use this material is beyond me, but I know that the mini california duster is the ONLY product I've found that can successfully clean the dust off of the dashboard.  It sounds trivial, but this is a really great product for the reason that it achieves what no other product can (or so I've found).This is the OEM cabin air filter for the 2006 Acura TL, and trust me: this thing does what it's supposed to do. I couldn't believe how much crud this thing had caught between the B12 service on my girlfriend's 2006 TL.One thing I will say is that this is a PITA to replace. After disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console, pull the console down. Directly down. That means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly... or you'll break a tab and your interior will never be the same. I've seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left. Don't be another.
Good in line carbon filter. Remember to flush it good prior to use in order to get the fines rinsed out. Woerks as advertised to clean up not so great water that is found in some campgrounds.AAA+++My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan--both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she's Made in Japan herself.We're also familiar with this kind of product in Japan, where it's called a "gum towel."I bought two actually, one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles--thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel.  It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames.  That is to say it's more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer.  If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac.  It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant.  And at 27" x 17" it's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don't expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we're thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works.  Absolutely 5 stars.This product is great on tires!!!! It's not runny and sticks well to the tires. For some reason it smells great to? Anyhow, wear some latex gloves and use a sponge like applicator to apply the gel. After a couple uses your tires will have soaked it in to the point that you will only need to use a dirty rag to wipe the dust and grime off the tires and they will actually still have a shine!! I recommend this product....&#34;PS works great on exterior trim as well.&#34;Dec. 16, 2013
Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.I don't have the time to write down all of the uses that this product can handle.  I know that it works for what I want it to do.  The down side is that it take 24 hours to fully cure.  Get some!  You will love it.  This price was cheaper than I could buy it locally at the Ace Hwr store
Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.

I have moved and no longer have a garage so I have to store my Goldwing out under a shed.  This cover goes on fairly easily and snugly fits my 2007 Goldwing.  I have no problems fitting it over the trunk/bags and motor area.  I have highway foot rests that extend out past the engine guard and the cover slips over them as well.The elastic on the bottom of the cover fits very well around the motor and trunk/bags.  I've not needed to even tighten up the cords to keep the cover on in some strong winds.  The cover is very secure over the motorcycle.  It has not scratched my windshield either.Seems to be tear and weather resistant.  It is not as thick feeling as a canvas type cover(nor as heavy) but is very sturdy material.I paid a bit more than current price for it but am very satisfied with the purchase.  Would buy it again.04/13/2013 Follow Up review:I've had this cover for almost 18 months now.  My motorcycle is still parked in the lean-to next to the shed and this cover has done an excellent job.  While it is out of direct contact with overhead sun and rain, It does get the full morning sun on the front and rain when the wind is blowing.  there has not been any significant fading of the cover and no leakage to date.  I am very happy with this cover.The leather bucket driver's seat in my 2000 Celica GTS was starting to get all kinds of rips in it.  Instead of paying $300 to have it recovered, I bought this seat cover instead.It fits reasonably well and surprisingly snug.  It is a little loose around the edges, but this is to be expected given that it's a generic cover and not custom fitted.  The little tag that slips through the back edge of the seat (and secured from the back) really helps keep the bottom secured.In addition to covering up the ugly tears in my seat, I notice this seat is a LOT cooler during the summer months that the stock leather seat.  My legs and backside used to sweat terribly during the summer heat here in Georgia.  I still sweat some, but the seat is much cooler now that my backside can breath a little bit.For the price, these are a great buy.This has to be one of the best leather care products out there. I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone.
This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try.Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.First off, don't get turned off by the name, Yellow is the color of the stuff, it won't turn your paint yellow!  It does look great on yellow paint though, also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black.  For lighter colors you are better off going with something else, Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros:-DRIPPY wet looks.  You'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint, its that wet!-Decent durability, approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons:-Stains trim (rubber, black plastic)-Needs to be applied very thin, otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall, this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great.  its a total steal at the price.
The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have.This product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover.  While it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint.  If you use this product I recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as Meguiar's  Ultimate Wax.  (paste or liquid)This is a great product for the money. Worked as described and built very well. Highly recommend this to anyone that works on their own cars.
The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.My husband installed these on his 97 Cherokee in just 10 minutes.  Remove 2 bolts on top of each lift support and place a screwdriver under the spring clip on bottom and the ball joint connection on the lower end slips right on.Trunk now stays up and doesn't hit him in his head! Worth the time and money for sure.Be sure to support the trunk with a 2x4 or long broom handle before removing old lifts. Save the bolts because there are no bolts provided with the new lifts.The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!
I got these nearly 10 years, ago, when they first came out.And, I've had a love-hate relationship with them.They slide around on concrete, when you try to drive on then with the front wheels of a rear wheel drive vehicle.Yes, I got frustrated with the sliding so much that I ran over them once and took chunks off of the very low backstops when they landed on the unibody "pinch weld" rails.  They still worked, however, when I used them, since the under wheel supporting structure on both ramps were still strong.Recently, I did discover how well these worked on a grass dirt surface, especially where I live with hard dense red clay.  They didn't move at all.I was happy until I discovered Race Ramps.Check them out.  They are much better and even lighter than the Rhino Ramps.  They have much higher back stops and they don't slip on either concrete, asphalt, grass or dirt.  They have s solid urethane-rubber coated structual foam surface and rated at 3,000 pounds for the pair.The only downside is that they cost about trice as much as the Rhinos.In the case of Race Ramps, you DO get what you pay for.The Rhino Ramps ar going away to a friend.used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area. I had 2 little spots approx. 1x2&#34; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top. let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat. It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products. I used &#34;Rost-Egal&#34; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far. You use it once and just know it works. With this very liquid product I am not so sure... It did not even seem to &#34;stick&#34; very well to vertical surfaces. For the next job I will look for a &#34;thicker&#34; product that will cling more to the treated area.I was worried that I would find this thing on the floor of my RV after driving with it on my stove for the first time.  I have now taken a few trips and so far it has stuck VERY well.  Actually, it sticks to the grate of the grill so well that the grate comes up when I try to remove the cutting board.  Also, it comes with a nice plastic cutting mat that you can use to protect the beautiful wood surface.
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.As for quality, sure it isn't top notch. But this thing isn't going to fall apart on you, these are tough and will hold. Scared for you life? Than go to a shop. The welding isn't perfect, but you have to realize this is mass produced. The welds aren't going to separate. I would definitely suggest using these in pairs, as in don't leave one alone to hold part of your vehicle. For those with cars, don't worry b/c cars weigh nothing. These are rated for as much as a cars avg weight. The double locking is a nice feature but not necessary on small jobs. My truck weighs over 6k so if these can hold one end, it will hold your average cars then too. If your doing small jobs, get these b/c theres no beating the price.Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern.
I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.Looks like your standard tire plug. I keep this in my trunk in case I ever get a &#34;good&#34; flat so I won't have to solely rely on the donut spare that came with the car.I have a 2002 Subaru Outback and this filter works great. The K&N nut is so handy to remove the filter, I would not go with any other filter anymore.
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet.
This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately.This is not the exact same cable that comes with the ScanGauge from LinearLogic, but it does the job. I would buy it again.This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Need a 90 degree to make life easier on one of my bikes,  one has a 90 degree on the tires already but this fit the bill on my GL1200. only problem I can see is the pin in the center is  plastic so dont know the longevity on it.Had to give it three stars for two reasons; first, in closed position, it rattles like a rattlesnake on my scooter.  Second, the clasps are a bit low, so if I hit a bump on my scooter, my coffee spills (in a 20 oz. mug).
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckPurchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
I installed this on my Audi I keep at a vacation house that only gets driven once a month.  It comes with two battery mounts - clips and a permanant set.  The permanant set installed quickly and easily on the battery - and there is a heavy duty plug witht a cover that I just tuck into the battery holder.  It all looks very clean and "factory installed".  When I leave town I just open the hood an inch - pull out the plug - and plug into the wall unit.  A red light indicates it is charging - green light means it is full.  All very simply and easy to use - and I never have the hassle of jumping the car or having to use another trickle charger.Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again,I really love this thing.  I go on long trips, and I've twice had my batteries die on me within the three year warranty period.  Since those warranties are pro-rated, and it's a huge pain to drag them back to the store, wait for the test, etc., there's really no advantage to having your batteries die.  I love the permanent ring terminal to plug set up that I can use to make it easy to hook up the battery charger to my vehicle and then know I don't have to worry about it anymore.Like another reviewer, I have an older BMW with the battery in the trunk.  I just put a small piece of 1 x 2 under the light switch so that the light turns out when I close the trunk.  Since I have waterproof electrical outlets in my garage (for washing cars), I cannot hook this up directly to the wall (because the outlets don't allow it), so I use a thick, outdoor, flat extension cord to go into the trunk, which also eliminates the possibility of damaging the charger's cable.  I can still lock the car doors with the trunk open.I forget the rating, but I have an unusually large battery in that car, and the first time I hooked this charger up, it took more than 24 hours for the light to turn green (which was okay with me).
The Battery Tender Alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts.  I can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery.  A very handy item to use with my Deltran 4-bank charger.This is a great package for carrying on the bike.  I connected the battery connector to my terminal and sealed the weatherproof cap over the connection.  I can then easily plug the charger in for trickle or connect the stout battery jumpers to a buddy's bike and get a jump.  Wonderful producti got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price
I use these on all my vehicles, from my 1930 Model A (6 volt version) to my quad and my '07 Silverado. They are very easy to install and should be used on any vehicle that sits for over a month at a time. I have nothing bad to say about them. Every one I have came with two sets of leads, and makes it very nice for multiple vehicles.I have a bunch of these in various models, 6v, 12v, and this one the multi-mode 12v. They really do a good job.Reasons I don't give a 5 star:I have had 3 of them go belly up. One the company replaced free, I have not bothered on the other two yet.The supplied "hard wired" harness has a inappropriately short cord before the connector.(Edit: the hardwired lugs to attach to the battery are also not appropriate many cars especially older ones as the hole is about right for a motorcycle battery. Making my own harnesses for making the unit hard-wired to the battery was a bit time consuming but they turn out well, just FYI don't expect to just bolt it on your standard battery clamp. Its way too small. The cig lighter, if your car has a permanently connected one is probably easier but new cars sometimes control this with key. Oh, two more comments - 1. It doesn't' come with a cig lighter attachment, its optional and 2. the optional hard wire hookup DOES have larger lugs on it)If you are wiring into a motorcycle it might just be long enough, but for my car applications I have always had to make my own harness extensions which is time consuming to get the wires all soldered, shrink wrapped.It does come with a nice little case.Having separate small battery mode and AGM mode is nice, although the paperwork on the basic ones mentioned they would charge AGM. AGM just takes a slower charge rate than lead/acid apparently as it heats up. I am not sure what they claim the AGM mode is, but nice to have it.California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).
This is a great package for carrying on the bike.  I connected the battery connector to my terminal and sealed the weatherproof cap over the connection.  I can then easily plug the charger in for trickle or connect the stout battery jumpers to a buddy's bike and get a jump.  Wonderful productThis is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!

Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.
Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected.

It does the job great.  Comes with everything you need and is simple to use and adjust.
No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youPurchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...It's sta-bil how can it be wrong and this is the best price I could find. I am very happy.
I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless.I replaced my stock H4 bulb in my 1983 Honda Goldwing with this bulb. It is a nice light that seems to light up the road better. I have Silverstar lamps in all my cars too.I replaced a rear sensor in a 1999 camry 4 cyl with this sensor to eliminate a check engine light failure.  It was easier than using an identical replacement because the cable ran through the floor pan under the driver's seat.  By using this I just cut the wires underneath the car, spliced them with included splices and heat shrink and added a layer of self-sealing rubber tape to protect and waterproof the splices.  No more check engine light for about $30.Update: Replaced the rear sensor on my 1998 camry also with perfect success - they went bad on both cars at around 120000 miles.
Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RVi can feel the difference. my engine is much smoother now. i used to have NGK for 4 years. Great investmentRepeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck
this piece fits on the battery on your car/truck/bike and connects to cable from battery tender, have this on all my equipt,toys for quick hook up.Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.I needed this in order to drain the waste tanks on our RV in case I wasn't able to do so on way home from a trip (or removing antifreeze from tanks in the Spring).  It twists on fine, makes a good seal to the drain fitting, and the hose outlet fitting does end up on the bottom so almost no liquid is left inside when draining is done.
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better.This is a great cover. It is long lasting and durable. It has a great finish and high quality like leather feel. As advertised, it also does not leave much smell on your hands. The steering wheel cover I had previously bought from Wal-Mart left strong odors on your hand.This strap is incredibly nicely made, I feel bad getting it all dirty putting it to use...a true quality showpiece!
They fit perfect, they do exactly what they are supposed to do, and I got them for a great price. What beats that?please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesHow do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckGreat Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE.THE HOPKINS SUB ZERO17511 ALL SEASON WINDSHIELD SCREEN  70&#34;X 29&#34; IS EXCELLENT IN PROTECTING YOUR WINDSHIELD FROM SNOW & SCRATCHES IN SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.I WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO EVERYONE TO PROTECT THEIR CAR WINDSHIELD IN THE WINTER.BOUGTH THESE WITH THE THOUGHT OF REPLACING CLEANING CLOTHS OR RAGS AS THEY ARE BETTER KNOWNTHESE ACTUALLY DO THE JOB AND THE PRICE IS GREAT
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.

I put these on the tongue of my 28' travel trailer, and am able to level in half the time vs. using just  my side and front mounted levels.Well made, and the Included double stick tape seems to stand up to the elements, so no need to drill holes to mount.A good buy.Very pleased I prefer to disconect at the plug then remove the leads to protect the little charger and my battery . These work great .If I can on cars I like to use the one that goes bolts on so you just plug in through the grill making putting cars on the charger nightly a breeze .strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.
Put full weight of my fifth wheel them with no problem, but you need two if you have a double axle. Lay them both down in the same direction and pull the trailer completely over the first one and onto the second. Be sue they are spaced the same distance as the wheel axles.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above.

The circumference for the steering wheel was right but I assume the "thickness" of the steerng wheel has changed as this does not cover the steering wheel correctly (front to back) and I had to remove and return...
My 2003 Silverado 1500 5.3 V* owners manual called for a GF626.....This is the EXACT same fit and goes on  easy. Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid...Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for.The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Working well in my 2002 BMW 330CI.

Would recommend.I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.

This makes using the jack so much easier in many cicumstances.  I bought it to go along with my 48" Extreme model for my 2011 Polaris Ranger Crew and unfortunately 9I guess fortunately) I have not had the opportinuty to use this attachment on my own rig but have already had the chance to use it to help others!  I love it!Shoppe around a little for a motorcycle filter for my 2004 Kawasaki Mean Streak. I like Fram and have used their filters on other bikes without any problems. So I bought it. Will buy another when the time comes.
Installed in a 2007 Camry Hybrid.  However, when I close the lid, I do see a bit of the white cover on the left but Fram says this is the correct part.  Did not notice any improvements in performance, but cheaper than OEM.I beleave I can really feel the difference in the power in the car can't tell the difference in mileage yet . The engine is quieter and smother running . Yes I would recommend this oil to all my friends.PaulFits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.

This is the easiest bug deflector I've installed.  I only had to use the double sided tape to attached it to my 2011 Jeep Rubicon.  I had to drill holes when I installed them on my 2000 S-10 (13 years ago) and drill holes on my 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer (7 years ago).2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!
Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too.Nothing flashy about this product. If anything, I would say it is a little over priced for what it is. It requires a $25 dollar shipment to be eligible for purchase, which as a Prime member seems a little excessive.This is a nice alternative to welding a tab on a hitch for a sway control. While I don't plan on having to move it to another hitch it is nice to know that if I had to I could. Which is something that can't be done with a weld on tab.
This thing seems extremely well made, even if it isn't made in the USA. I had a cheap gun before this and blew the seals on the second use. This pumped grease into some well rusted fittings with ease.My only complaint is the hose fitting that attaches to the zerks. Yes, it is a 2 piece design as many have mentioned which is both good and bad. If you have easily accessible zerks that need a lot of pressure, you can screw this on and use both hands to pump. However, large u-joints can be a huge pain as I can't get anything in to tighten the fitting. I found I had to keep making adjustments then sticking it in the joint until I found the perfect setting where it fit on the zerk but didn't lose grease. However, there were a few joints where I was unable to find this balance and couldn't get them to take grease. I will have to buy a different hose to get them all.The provided foam spacers and fit was perfect on my 2013 JEEP OEM hitch receiver.  Sturdy and well made.  The one I received had round corners so I did not have to 'modify' it as some other's stated they had to do.  I will not leave this permanently in my hitch and the weather, since there is potential for moisture to get into it.  If you put keys in this I'd suggest a zip log bag.  There are two holes in the back of the unit which I suspect is to allow moisture to escape, I thought about using Silicone RTV to close those up, but decided against it.  Weather, and especially near coastal areas, will probably corrode the combo lock at some point so I will not leave it permanently installed, and will keep in my cab until I need it.Lots of glowing praise on this item and while I agree with most of the comments like great leverage, good in tight spaces, easily adjustable, long reach... and so on... it failed me miserably on the first use. I had a filter that was not "hand tight" as many expect them to be when they're ready to slide under and twist them off with just a light touch of pressure. The filter on my 1999 Expedition is right behind the bumper so I'm not sure if that placement exposes it more to the elements and makes removal more difficult or if the filter was last replaced and tightened way too much... last change was by a Ford dealer because it was a freebie. I clamped onto the top of the filter and it immediately punched holes into it with the claws that are suppose to grip the filter... and then came the oil down my arm. I tried again at the base of the filter where there's a little more metal and immediately got another set of holes. I went for the strap wrench but that wouldn't budge it either. I finally got it off with my KR Tools 12153 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliers. I know all filters aren't difficult to remove but I've been changing my oil & filters... plus most repairs... for about 50 years and this is not the only filter I have had problems removing. I will be purchasing a cap type filter wrench and have given this wrench 1-star because I could not get the filter off with it and it punched holes in the filter... and since this tool is pretty much useless for any other job it'll likely be donated or just sink to the bottom of my auto tool drawer. I don't care about the holes as much as I did the resultant oil leak or the potential that the filter may have to be removed in pieces. I'm also surprised that one reviewer talks about holes and how this wrench didn't cause any in the removal or install... and I think anyone who tightens a filter with a wrench is asking for problems. I have purchased quite a few TEKTON tools on Amazon from wrenches to sockets and have not been disappointed... until now. Lastly, if your filter is on tight you should be able to exert enough pressure with a tool to get it off without punching holes in it.Since I was able to get it off with the pliersKR Tools 12153 Pro Series 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliersthat would seem to be the better tool investment if you have a large filter... at least the jaws have more teeth for a better grip, the teeth are not likely to puncture the filter, it has a lot more potential for other uses where an oil wrench does not and the price is about the same. I have used the pliers on many other things without an issue or damage to what I was working on... especially good for my 1-1/2" PVC irrigation and pump lines.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The fender flares arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date! The passenger side front fender has a flaw in it!  The side moldings do not fit flush against the fender flares?  The only positive is that the fenders where easy to install! I would not recommend this product to other!This is a fairly standard classic wiper blade, the usual steel frame and wiper. Valeo made these look a little more racing with the two rails and cross ladder look, but they are at the heart a standard wiper blade.These would be perfectly fine blades if the attachment piece was a bit stronger. The wiper comes with a host of adapters, none of which are installed. My 2002 Buick Rendezvous has the standard U shaped wiper arm. There is a nasty little plastic clip that has to be forced over the center pin. Then the wiper arm U is pulled on until it clicks. There is no release tab, so removal will be no fun.The three layers of rubber material seem nice. If the blade gives me a year of service I'll be happy. This is an extremely low profile frame with no aerodynamics. I'm not sure how well it will work on a windshield at high speed. I bought this for the rear window of my car. Because this blade is so low profile, the old worn out wiper arm on my car needs to be replaced (not the blade's fault). If you have an older car with old wiper arms, you might want to consider the Michelin Stealth wipers - they stand taller.This is a good rear window windshield wiper blade.February 24, 2014 Update - the 16 inch blade on the rear window has lasted a year and a half - it works like brand new (streak and chatter free). My son decided he disliked the Michelin blades I put on the front windows and wanted Valeos on the front. Now the SUV has Valeo all around. I expect these blades will last well over a year. They work great brand new.
Perfect fit and function on a 2003 BMW 325i - good buy, with Prime, its easy to plan purchase around oil changesFits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks
These seem to be happiest on concrete or hard ground, if the ground is soft or slightly unlevel they bow and will not stabilize the inside of the 5th wheel.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer.
I had to change out an old 20-inch tire for a new one on my Craftsman riding mower.  I've changed a lot of bike-type tires over the years but nothing like the mower tire.  I needed some kind of tire tools and didn't have any.  Since these looked like a step up from a couple of over-sized screw drivers, I thought they might do.I'm glad I bought them but, in order to complete the job, I found that I needed an automobile sized tire tool as well.  Still, I'm glad to have these in the tool box for future projects.  They are well made and I expect them to be around after I'm not.I bought 2 of these, one to keep in my truck for road side emergencies and the other for automotive work use at home. The few times I have used them they work well, but just so you know they have a recommended expiration date on them. I think this is due to their intended use as a RV chock, where they would sit in the sun a lot and would degrade. But again they are cheap, and if the worries you, just buy a new one and toss out the suspect one!I bought these horns to replace my rusted out horns on my camaro.  Note that you need the high and low as they work in unison.  It took me about 15 min to replace them and these work as good as new. You'll have to splice in to your existing wiring ( I just used some 3m quick connects to splice in ) and I reused the stock locations and bolts.  These horns come with brackets as well.
I have used K&N; for years in my vehicles so when it was time to change the Air Filter in our 2003 Toyota Corolla, it was K&N; time again. Now this filter is about 3 times the price of a cheap paper one, but they really do last 100,000 miles before they need to be cleaned. Do they improve mileage? I think they do, but they also improve performance slightly, so unless you have a light right foot you probably wont see much of a difference. When I do notice the gas savings is on the long freeway runs.One thing, when fitting it be careful, the old paper filters will fit in either way around, but the K&N; has 2 nubs on it that make it directional. If you put it in the wrong way around the lid just won't get close enough to close the clips, but rotate it so the nubs are facing the front of the car and the lid will fit perfectly.They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down.These are ok. They keep the water from reaching the floor, but without ridges - they also keep the water to where it hits your shoes. In and out of the car in snowy and icy conditions and you can be damn sure that you are going to end up getting freezing water in your shoes as an unpleasant surprise. They are hard to empty without spilling because of the lack of a lip on the front of the liner. So, you either wait till the water drys on its own - which doesn't happen in winter, soak it up with a towel, or attempt to empty it and end up with water exactly where it wasn't supposed to go. However they probably work fine for sandy or muddy conditions, as they are pretty easy to clean off. Overall, there are better options and I wish I had gone with one of the other options instead.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.If you have ever tried to pull off automotive trim pieces using metal (such as a screwdriver) then you know the damage it can cause. Plus, a screwdriver or a credit card or some other tool is just not the right tool for the job. I used this kit to pull trim and replace stereos in both my cars today: BMW & Toyota. They came in handy for both. Without this kit, I don't think I could have got the BMW done without screwing something up. Super handy tools to have if you're type of person to mess around with the interior of your vehicle.

My 1999 Lexus RX300 was getting CEL (P0125, P1030, P1033 & P1035).  Read the postings on ClubLexus and found Denso 234-9009 is perfect fit for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (behind firewall, access from underneath the vehicle).  Removing the connector is the biggest job.  Used a pickup tool with wire prongs to hold the sensor connector part from the top, pressed the tab on the right connector and disconnected relatively easily.  Jacked up the front passenger side, went underneath the vehicle and sprayed PB blaster penetrating oil on the old sensor threads, waited for a few minutes and was able to get it out easily using an O2 sensor removal tool.  Applied the anti-seize that came with the package on the new sensor threads and installed.  Total time spent was under 30 minutes!  Disconnected the battery negative terminal for a few minutes, then started the engine and the codes didn't come back!  Check out the pictures posted in the images section.This sensor works for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (before catalytic converter, access from underneath the vehicle) and Bank 2 Sensor 1 (between the engine and radiator, accessed from the top).Note: Recommend using two jack stands for added safety while working under the vehicle.PB Blaster:Blaster 16-PB Penetrating Catalyst - 11 oz.O2 Sensor Tool:Powerbuilt 648691 Oxygen Sensor Offset PullerUpdate: February 16, 2014The Check Engine Light (CEL) is staying off and the mileage has improved.  My vehicle registration is coming up and it is due for SMOG check.  I'll update the review with the results of the test.I began with Step 1 Polish, and Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, and finished up with the Step 3 Wax, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball put the wax on smoothly and uniformly, and after doing Step 1 and Step 2, my hands welcomed the break using the Powerball.  The car looks a brilliant white now.  With all the work preparing the finish, I put 3 coats of wax on it.  The car is a full-size, and there is enough Step 1 and Step 2 to do at least another car, and despite the 3 coats of wax, there is still enough in the bottle for maybe another 2 or 3 wax jobs.  Very pleased with the 3 Step process, and the Powerball.This replaced two different drain pans one was a Blitz 6 qt drain that was absolutely the worse ( also listed under the Flo Tool brand) . the wide lip on this keeps the oil from splashing out and is easy to empty and clean.
Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are.This is a relatively cheap wash mitt. There is a lot of foam padding, however the actual microfiber content is minimal and not thick or plush. There are many better, higher end microfiber towels available from dedicated detailing stores.I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon.
I tried to be careful, so I enter my car information. Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit.I was looking for this air filter on the K&N website and went to AutoZone priced at 50-60 bucks. I put in my car info said, doesn't fit. BUT, it DOES fit my 2004 Crown Victoria perfectly.Amazon's website says the 15" version of this wiper will fit on a 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  That is not really true.  This wiper was "backwards" what my Cayenne required and I had to spend 15 minutes reversing the rubber to get it to fit the Cayenne.If you have a Porsche Cayenne, try something else.
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road.  Sand = Nope. Mud = Nope.  Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly. (I know from experience - ugh)
Our Battery Tender Plus is on a shelf in the garage, and the RV with its battery is parked outside.  This cable runs from the charger to the wall of the garage, down to and thru a vent hole in the wall, then across the driveway, under the RV, then up front to the battery box.  It turned out to be just long enough.  When we leave on a trip, I turn off the charger, then coil the cable beside the garage till we return.  We no longer worry about fast-charging the battery every month or so during the winter to keep it from freezing....that the clear hose may come disconnected from the yellow fitting and fall right down into my fw tank.  It hasn't happened yet, but it surely could.  I'm very careful when I use it to inspect the tightness of that (friction) connection.  When it becomes weak, I'll replace it.Hopefully by then, one of my fw hoses will have sprung a leak, and I could just cut off a foot on the female side of the hose and use that!As you may know, one cause of the "check engine light" coming on your dash is lack of pressure in the fuel system due to a faulty gas cap.Normally, when the "check engine light" comes on, I go out and tighten the gas cap; if that's the cause, the light will go off in an hour or so.However, if the light stays on, a cheap option is to replace the gas cap - a lot cheaper than taking it to the shop and getting charged an hour of labor and the shop cost of a gas cap. In my state, a car with the "check engine" light on during the inspection period will fail the inspection.If you replace the cap, and the light still stays on, then take it to the shop.This is a good price on the cap.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.I use it on a 17 foot Boston Whaler.  I connected it directly to the battery so I can use spot lights, other lighting, charge cell phones, etc.  Can't get any simpler.  Basically a piece of useful junk.  Recommend it.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.
The BatteryMinder #12248 is a 2/4/8 amp charger and the best charger i have ever used. It is built to last. Will quickly clean sulphur off the lead plates. Can make a weak to almost dead battery good again. Will increase the voltage even on a newer battery. This is now my favorite charger. Cannot hurt any battery. It just makes any battery much better. Will also maintain a battery better and safer than most other low amp maintenance chargers. No other battery charger compares to this model BatteryMinder, the #12248. I don't know about the other models, but this model does more and it is amazing. It cost more but this charger is probably 10 times better than the rest. I am getting more than my moneys worth, every time i use it. It will pay for itself by restoring an almost dead battery. It will actually make an old battery useable again and for a long long time. Don't bother with any more searching or reviewing of battery chargers. Just get this BatteryMinder model. You have now found the best! I should know, i have a shop. I know other auto shop owners that would rather just sell you a new battery. Most auto repair shops do not use this charger. They just test the battery for draw and voltage. You might easily get a couple more years out of your old battery if you use the BatteryMinder first. Enough said, bye.I can tell this probably won't last long, but as long as you're not expecting something that will last you a few years this will do the trick. I used this to change my power steering fluid and it worked well. The siphon end is pretty big though, so if you're expecting to drain anything with a small fill hole you might be out of luck.I have this unit and its capable of starting my 2002 F-250 Diesel when the batteries are weak. As most of you know diesels have two heavy duty batteries due to the great amount of torque needed to start diesels. This unit will actually get my truck running if I have accidentally left some electrical accessory on. They are more expensive than most but worth every penny. If this unit doesn't start your vehicle, its not because of a battery problem.
First of all, the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car's motor. Secondly, the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable.I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.Bought this charger to replace the rediculous charger that comes with power wheel cars and trucks. Had to do some minor wiring connector swaps, but this charger is soooo much faster and actually let's me know when the battery is done! Terrific charger, I would buy another!!! Can't beat the price and functionality......
...oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now.This does as it is advertised to do.I have my jack on a roof rack and it helps keep rattles down. You have to take the top clamp off the extreme jack to take it on and off but I still think it is worth it.This hitch lock looks good and I expect will foil the casual thief.  It seems to me an aggressive thief could pry this lock off, but of course I have not tried it.  It fits a little loosley in my 2 5/16" hitch but does it's job.My main complaint with this lock is removing the insert that fits into the hitch ball area as it slides backwards to release the lock.  Almost every time when taking this off we have ended up with nasty grease on your hands from inside the hitch ball area.  I highly recommend using disposable plastic gloves when removing.  Obviously a learning curve to pay attention to this messy situation.I do recommend the lock and would buy it again, just be aware that it can be messy.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.
arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?

If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.This is a great gauge to have in glove compartment or garage, checked it against my very accurate pencil gauge that is not a cheap one, same pressure readings.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.

Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation
This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.This is a great quality -  made in the USA tire inflator.The ONLY problem I have found is this model does NOT have a deflate feature, the only was to lower the pressure is to raise the chuck up off the stem slightly to allow the air to leak out.Almost nothing to it, mass wise, has an adhesive disc on the back approximately 1.5" across, slightly off-center.  The actual mirror part thought seems to be silvered plastic (no surprise), but arrived with what appears to be scuffing directly from the packaging itself.  As long as there isn't a light source in the reflection, it's barely noticeable, but it's there.
If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI.Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.If you are going to change plugs on a 5.5 L ford with the real long plug  buy this prior so you can coat the plugs around the flat for possible an easy removal later
I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.I bought these at a well known camping store.  They work pretty good.  The plastic pins are not fastened in though, so I put a dab of superglue on each side of the pin (at the edge of the fabric) and now the pins are securely in place.I also was not a big fan of the hooks... so I used some small binder clips.  If you squeeze the metal tab on the binder clip you can pop it out of the clip - then feed it through the grommet and put the tab back into the clip.  Now you have a secure clip to hold your lights!This requires you to slide the tabs off the awning before rolling it back up.I downgraded this to 4 stars since they didn't have the plastic pins fixed into place.This is a much better way to hang lights than using clothespins to attach them to the flap of the awning.  We had some storms when we were camping and not a single string of lights came off.  (I had tie-downs on the awning)So buy these, get some binder clips, and get a tube of superglue and you will be all set.I have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade, and this is my fourth cover purchase.  They are fantastic quality and fit for the price!Storage indoors, and the cover will easily last 5+ years if you're careful not to snag it, as it will tear easily on sharp corners (mirrors, license-plates, etc.).  For the first 5-6 years of my bike's life, it was stored indoors, and one cover lasted easily during that period... where I live now, I don't have that luxury (yet).Outdoors, this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful UV damage for at least two seasons (mine started to fall apart after 3-years of year-round, outdoor coverage, but I also coat it annually with Camp-Dry to increase water repellent ability and UV protection).  The elastic does start to give out after a couple of years, but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds.Sizing:For sizing, The XL fits perfectly (slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn-signals) over my 1100cc Honda Sabre with 19" windshield, large saddle-bags, and small tour-pack behind sissy-bar.  This XL fits exactly the same as the XL made 10 years ago, with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals... I'd be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there.If I had to buy again, it would be a toss-up as to the XL or XXL.  My last one was an XXL and it was very loose-fitting, which caused it to flap in the wind, catch wind under it, and sagged in heavy rain, which created places where water would "pocket" on top or droop to the seat-level, eventually soaking through the material.  The XXL also covered (almost) all the way to the ground, which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes/engine touching the black material (not the heat-resistant silver).Design Change:The newest version of this cover also does not have silver running 360-degrees around the cover, as in the picture.  The black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel, and the silver starts right behind the forks.  This does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting, and actually looks much better when on the bike.Cons:My only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more "nylon-feel" than "cloth-feel" of the ones made 10 years ago (or even five years ago), and the cover does not have the full Nelson-Rigg logo... missing "More than just a Bike" wording below the logo... no biggie, but having the full logo does make it easier to find the "front" of the cover in the dark :)  I do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least, as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months, and still looks like NEW.  We'll have to see about longevity... but if it lasts 2-3 years in outdoor conditions, I'll not be complaining!Update 6-8-14:When putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain, the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors.  The rip was not bad, but very disappointing to spend $40 on a cover that has barely held up to 6-months of use and very mild weather!  I will be contacting Nelson Rigg to obtain a replacement under warranty!
Just as it says.  Easy to install, is good quality and functions just as it should.  To install, all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place.  The ring does not have to be removed.  Place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover.  That easy!It worked perfectly to remove the spark plugs. the grip part is left visible when inserted in the spark plug hole, so, you can continue removing or adjusting the spark plug with hand. good tool, right size.It is a high capacity suction gun. I used it to suction power steering fluid for my bmw335i in just one shot.  The only cons is the vinyl hose is a bit large and the remaining tiny fluid in the reservior can not be suctioned thoroughly.  Other than that, all is fine. No leaking at all. Do not forget to clear the vinyl hose and inside of the gun after use so that you can keep it longer.
First, this is a great unit and rock solid at brake control.  I upgraded from a Tekonsha Prodigy.  It's Simple!  Just removed the older unit (Prodigy) from it's existing bracket, unplugged the existing wiring plug, plugged in the P-3.  I slid the P-3 into the old bracket and inserted the 2 screws.  It's installed.Then I just adjusted the P-3 per the included operating instructions. It could not have been simpler.Starting from scratch?  About an hours work and the instructions are all there.  Most newer trucks come with a trailer harness for a controller.  My 06 Chev 2500HD did.  However there are instructions for installing it without a dealer supplied harness as well.Highly recommend this unit vs. others if mounted at eye level.  (see "Update Aiain).Update:  This is a great unit.  BUT, other than an LCD screen to provide additional info for the user, the ability to control the braking action is no better/ no worse than the Prodigy I replaced.Update again:  The LCD screen is impossible to read if the unit is mounted low on the dashboard area and/or if you wearing polarized sun glasses.  I switched back to the LED unit which is far easier to see and read.DOWNGRADED TO 4 Stars!bought this long time ago, and have used many times!the back light feature is very useful in the dark,in my couple long trip in the middle of no where without a light i can easily read it, people reviwed that it is very hard to seal and measure. for me it's no problem at all, once get it used to, it is really handy n useful. one thing is that the power button is not really the power button but still works well!!The only hard part was pushing it up onto the kingpin. I sprayed a little white lithium grease on the kingpin and it greatly reduced the amount of effort required to install this plate. Other than that the plate is holding up well, no complaints!
I bought this so that I could change the oil on my 2010 Toyota RAV4.  What can I say other than that it works perfectly and appears to be of good quality.  I've had it for two years now and have used it in 4 oil changes!This little compressor is solid, heavy and fairly quite, especially when compared to the cheap piece of junk I've been using for countless years. I never could justify spending the money for a better tire inflator but when my wife asked me what I wanted for Christmas I sent her this link. I like the canvas bag, carrying handle, pressure gauge, sport needle (man did I ever need that) and quality hose. Overall I'm very impressed and find this a great item. I tried it on a tire that was 10 lbs low and it filled it up in approximately 2 minutes. 5 times faster then my old unit! Plus it's much cheaper on Amazon then it is in our local store.On the advice of a friend, I replaced my Toyota Tacoma's manual transmission gear oil with this Royal Purple Max. From the start, I encountered poor shifting and excessive gear noise. After two months the shifting got so bad, I opted to replace it with the previous gear oil I was using (Redline MT90). Now my shifting is back to being easier, with the gear noise gone... For the price of this oil it should have performed better than it did - I was very disappointed.
It's an extension cord.  It does the job and is quality made.  4 stars only because it's a bit pricy for what it is.It took awahile for this order to get fulfilled, but it is worth the wait for the price. It is exactly what it is suppose to be. RP takes the cake!This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.
I use this for small areas of the auto that gets water spots or dirty.  Excellent for dusting as well, avoids dry dusting that may leave swirls.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.All my life I have been using different versions of Windex or ammonia or home-brews or bon-ami - this surely beats them all!!! It can be found locally at Kragen's and PepBoys. This cleaner and a couple micro-fiber towels do a great job inside or outside windows and lenses.
Does exactly what it's supposed to do,fit low and snug on the filter cover. To work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment.Recommended for sure!3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter.Secures a light car by chocking the wheels.  Pros: Lightweight, small, stacks together  Cons:  Alittle too lightweight, hollow, possibly bordering on flimsy.  Would be great if the plastic/polycarbonate material was thicker or more filled for sturdiness and heft.
Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.Overall: highly recommended. First use was enough for me. Hopefully this product will withstand weekly washings. Will keep you updated if it doesn't.This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?
Although my camper is a pop up hard sided unit, it has a scissor jack at each corner with small pods attached to the jacks to keep the camper from rocking. These pads keep the camper feet from sinking into the ground and help to keep the camper level and eliminates rocking. They are easily cleaned if you put the waffle side up and let the smooth side touch the ground.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.
After 200-300 miles i realized i had a leak from under my SV1000S. after investigation it was the o-ring that was dry rotted. no telling how long this thing sat on the shelf before it was sent to me. I guess this is a problem that could have happened when buying it from a local store but nonetheless frustratingthis the first time that i received a package like this...the car wax container was busted and it was all over the box. i was really disappointed. i dont know what to expect next time. such a waste...This winterizing kit was delivered promptly and is a good quality product. It installed easily and quickly without any special tools. I opted to use pipe dope on the the plastic fittings since that's what was used originally on the trailer. Instructions were spot on.
This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.It is a battery in a box that will help you jump start vehicles.  Love the plug and leave it charging.  This unit, at least the one I got, has the built in self charger that will not allow over charging of the battery.  I also like the fact it does not have all the gadgets the other unit out there have.  They filled the space in this unit with a bigger battery!!
I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns!I purchased this charger because I termed it 'smart' because of all of the different charging modes it employs.  The deciding factor for this particular model is that it has the constant voltage that you can use when you disconnect the battery to clean the terminals or change the battery.  More important to me than the radio presets are the engine control module settings.  It's nice not having to wait for the computer to relearn the particular variations of settings from the default ones.After reading several reviews on this product I have to agree with most comments in regards to the locking fuel cap being poorly made. The Cap fits fine for the application. However the key mechanism is flimsy at best. The quality of the plastic components are not what I remember a Stant Locking Fuel cap to be. They def cheapened out on their manufacturing process`s.I gave the Stant Locking Fuel cap a 3 star rating only bc it does fit and is doing what the intended use is for. I do feel that if someone wants to remove the cap by force, they absolutely can. I primarily purchased this product based on Stant`s reputation in the Auto market, but this one leaves myself a bit disappointed. This is being used as a deterrent to help prevent vandals from pouring anything foreign into the tank. It does operate correctly when following the unlocking/locking procedures.
Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.If you work on dirty/greasy stuff, you need this.Gritty, to get the grunge out of your fingerprints/creases, doesn't smell odd, and it dissolves grease like you would not believe.  One cleaning, and you're likely done, even if your hands could double as pumpkin lube. (automotive reference)
I use this on my r1 during the cold days in winter or when ever i put the bike in to storage. Still working till now and this includes a spare wire to place a dis-connectable connector from your battery to the battery tender (which can be routed from your battery to your backseat compartment) Highly recommended.Recently replaced all the oil in my front dif/rear diff/ and transfer case on an 07 Tundra. Went from Mobile1 to this, and noticed a slight improvement in noise.I'd use this again.I use this and a garden hose to send the shower water away from camp, works well when boondocking in the woods for a week.
This is the best way to change your oil. I can change my oil wearing a tuxedo with no mess, thanks to these pumps.Get the 7400 instead of the 7201. It's more reliable because it has fewer parts (such as the bidirectional pumping). It's also cheaper. Although I wish these were 10 quart models to hold an entire Mercedes oil change, none of the Mityvac models are, so you will have to empty it halfway through.A good way to tell if your extractor works properly on your car is to pump all the oil and then pull the drain plug. If nothing comes out, your car is empty and the pump worked. If oil comes out, the pump didn't get it all and you probably should drain rather than pump your car. In theory the pump can get more out than draining, since it goes to the bottom of the pan, whereas the plug typically has a lip that prevents it from draining all the oil.Nice cover and much better then the one that came with my Hybrid RV. Allows you to get to the valves from the top which is really nice if you have a Hybrid where the front bed is above the LP tanks so if you need to get to your tanks you won't have to put the pop-out beds back in just to lift the cover off the LP tanks. The top opening lid isn't going anywhere like someone posted here that they lost it on the road. If you close it like you should it locks in place and is very secure... no way could it come off and get lost. I Ordered Polar white and thats what I received and matches the old one.For most folks but if you need it and fail to use it really bad things will happen.I bought a Porsche where the previous owner had changed the plugs and failed to use the anti--seize and years later when it was time to change the plugs because you cannot actually see the plugs it is easier to remove the head to put repair helicoils into the aluminum as the plugs will not come out without taking the threads.  This is how the world works.  Failure to install something whre this product is needed will cost you dearly down the road. Before you begin anything with aluminum first find your bottle of anti seize so you know you can put the project back together without doing permanent damage.
Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.Hi All.There is not a whole lot you can say about a "Plastic Bag Holder"  It does do as it says it does, and that is a place to stroe your Plastic Bags in your RV.  Its neat and orderly to use.  Only real issues, is look at the size of your RV's Cabinet Doors and measure before you do buy this Plastic Bag Holder.  It is made very well for what it is.  Its a very Heavy Duty Plastic made holder.  I was a little surprized at the size of it.  I too, should have measured.  But it did work out for us, as we have faily large Cabint Doors in our Motorhome.  You could also mount it inside of a Cabinet or on a Closet Wall, out of the way also.  And it does hold a fair amount of Plastic bags, for later use.  Happy Travels.
The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.It is simple, it is a hitch lock that locks. If that is what you want then this is what you are looking for. I like it, i keep my hitch on 24/7/365 now and never worry it might get jacked!It is just what it is supposed to be and I am satisfied. There is no way to tell if it will fall apart quickly or last forever so that is all I can say.
Good cabin air filter. Installed in 08 Mazda 5. It is a bit of trouble to change this filter. Also filter is a little awkward getting in for installation. Overall does a god job filtering air inside van. Product is must have and cheaper than dealership. Just be patient with install.This line of filter is good to use in a cabin equipped air filter vehicle.  The fresh breeze has the charcoal to help eliminate odors.  This same filter at Toyota was 80 bucks.I bought it on Amazon, verified buyer. It is true that sometimes it takes times for oil to lubricate your engine: it could be weak oil pump or restricted flow. It fits my Lexus LS400. After I change oil with this new filter, I hear the ticking sound on the engine head; it could be the filter restrict oil flow and cause the oil not to flow easily.
The products included in the kit are highly rated car care products. The variety of uses combined with the manufacturer's reputation make this kit a good value.Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it.I purchased this gauge on Amazon for $5.99 with FREE Super Saver ShippingIt is a handy tool and quite useful; the only drawbackfor me  is that it only measures in imperial measurements.Metric measurements are always more precise.
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderMine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.
7 Prong connector is the best for use in any towing situation even if you only need a flat 4 lead connection.  This unit is well used on rigs where you may run into many towed vehicle applications that do not match the 7 pole set up.  4 pole is at the ready if you need it.I purchased two of these 20' ft heavy duty tow straps to leave in the back of my 2007 tahoe.  I have pulled multiple cars out of ditches with these straps. They are a life saver and not expensive.  I would have paid double for these.  These are a great emergency item to leave in the trunk of your car.  You never know when you will need them.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
HAVE A LINC NAV AND THOUGH IT IS NOT TH BEST FIT IT WORKS, LETS I A BIT A SHINE BUT NOT MUCH, WISH THEY MADE TO HAVE A BETTER FIT FOR DIFFRENT AUTOS BUT THAN THAT WOULD NOT BEFEASABLE FOR THEM ITS GOODI READ ALL THE POS FEEDBACK ON THIS PRODUCT AND HAD TO TRY SOME..THIS STUFF DOES WORK WELL..I HAVE A 1996 FORD RANGER WITH A ROUGH IDLE..POURED SOME IN THE TANK..WITHIN A DAY OR 2..THE IDLE SMOOTHENED OUT..GOT TO USE IT EVERY NOW AND THEN TO KEEP THEM INJECTORS CLEAN..BETTER THAN ANY FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER I EVER USED..IT WORKS GUYSTHIS LARGER THAN i EXPECTED, MY FAULT. SEEMS TO DO A GOOD JOB HOLDING KNIVES AND PROTECTING FINGERS. READ SPEC, SIZE CAREFULLY. NICE COLOR AND FINISH.
I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank you
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW owners
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Best price on the internet&#8230;.worked great on gear oil replacement for my F-150 2001 axle.  Last time it will need to be replacedFits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.
This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.This rain suit is awesome for the money iam a motorcycle safety instructor and this is the kinda of product i recommend new students purchase its made great and can be seen in the rain
I put my sports car to bed in the winter, battery would be dead with out this charger.  Needed an extension to reach the carI use this on my r1 during the cold days in winter or when ever i put the bike in to storage. Still working till now and this includes a spare wire to place a dis-connectable connector from your battery to the battery tender (which can be routed from your battery to your backseat compartment) Highly recommended.I used to take out my boat battery and bring it into the house to keep it trickle charged. With this extension cable I can now charge it right in the driveway without having to pull the battery every time!!! my back loves this
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceIt's a quick and easy way to have a battery hook up on your boat, motorcycle, four wheeler, golf cart, just about anything with a battery in it where you might could use a charger, or 12 volt outlet...WM
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Can never go wrong with slime stuff.Don't put too much in a tire or you will be able to feel it moving around when you ride...a dirt bike...for instance.Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them.
I bought this product to keep my motorcycle charged between rides.  I ride the bike pretty often so I probably don't need it but it does come in handy for those occasions when I go a week or more without riding, like when I am doing upgrades or repairs to the bike.  I just plug it in the night before a ride and in the morning the battery is fully charged and ready to roll.  Great product for a reasonable price.  I really like the jumper cables and keep them in  my saddle bag in case of emergencies!I have found few RV camp sites to be level. I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well.

Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again,My bike came with a Yuasa battery and I"ve heard good things about Yuasa.  So why not buy a charger from the same company that makes your batter??Its nice to have the two types of batter connectors.  I mount the hard-wire kit to my motorcycle and whenever it will sit for a while, i can charge the battery without needing to take off the seat, etc to get to the batter.  Then you also have the alligator clips to use when you need to charge other batteries like lawn equipment.I've smog problem on my old car, after trying this products, its solve out the problem and pass the smog check. Save time and money to go through mechanic to fix it before you can get the smog pass before you fix the engine. Is Work.
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.I put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY&#8230; Way&#8230; Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.Great stuff every one should have some laying around!Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.
Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLtotal time saver. Never leave home without it sorta deal. Once you have one, you'll wonder how you did without.
After doing a lot of research on AGM batteries, I finally decided on this one.  This was a Birthday gift for my son, to be installed in his '03 Subaru Forester.I started out looking at the Optima Red Top, but the reviews were not as as good & people I know have had problems with their Red Top battery failing.  Now the choice was between the Sears DieHard Platinum & the Optima Yellow Top.The Sears DieHard Platinum looks like a very good battery & it's said to be made by Odyssey.  Not really sure thats true?  What pushed me over to the Optima Yellow Top was the heaver weight, much higher cost & shipping hassles if I went with the Sears DieHard Platium.The Optima Yellow Top was delivered quickly by UPS.  It comes in a heavy-duty, double walled cardboard box.  The battery inside the box was protected with more cardboard packing & the top of the battery was covered with a protective plastic cover.  With the attached removable lift handle, the battery was easy to remove from the shipping box.  The battery was in perfect condition!We found the Optima Yellow Top sits lower than a standard type 35 battery.  Not a problem, since a spacer is provided, which snaps onto the bottom of the battery.  This made the battery fit perfectly in my son's '03 Subaru Forester.  The battery comes fully charged, so once we hooked up the cables, the engine started right up!We would recommend this battery & the plan is to install one of these in our other 2 vehicles.&#9658; Update - October 23, 2012Since I wrote this review, I bought another Optima Yellow top for our '95 Neon Sport.  I should note that this isn't a direct replacement for the stock battery in the stock location!  We relocated the battery to the trunk & a sealed battery (less chance of gassing) was the way to go.  We completed this project over the summer & it was a complete success!As to the previous battery installed in the my son's '03 Subaru Forester.  It's been 100% trouble free! :)First of all, the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second, once the car is started, you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display, indicating that a charge is occurring. However, this is a static icon, it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom. And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery. For this you need accurate readings, and I can not see these on this unit.K&N; have apparently moved their production to Mexico. Older filters of this same type have been made in the U.S.A. I don't immediately notice any quality difference, and the "Mexican" types are sealed in cellophane inside the cardboard box.  This is good, because in a humid environment, if you stock up the shelf of the garage like I do, small traces of surface rust can form on unprotected threads.  I have one of the U.S.A. ones left, and I'll open this one up to more fully compare gaskets, construction, and measurements between the two. Will update.Note: Avoid the "PS" series of K&N.; Inferior quality, not worth the slight price difference.----UPDATE----The center threaded disc that spins onto the post of your vehicle's filter mount has some glue or sealant in the transition between the disc and the rest of the filter's base. I cleaned it off, but am a little disappointed, since the stuff could have come off on its own and circulated through the engine. Maybe it would eventually be caught by the filter, or maybe the particles would just lodge somewhere in the engine.  Not good.  Never saw this on the U.S.A. made filters, and the company had better keep a tight handle on quality control in case other manufacturing issues turn up.This problem is not serious enough to downgrade my initial 4-star rating.
Good for filling in areas when doing custom work or doing body work to a damaged area. It's a &#34;pint can&#34; but only has 14oz in it so it was only enough for a smaller project.This does not fit my wheels. It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations. The 100 is identical, except for the 0-60 it is 0-100, but states it has a 11" hose but it doesn't. I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away.This filter combined with an Airaid MRT helped my 2004 Tahoe make a little more power and sound like it has a V8 under the hood! The filter fit nicely and should provide plenty of filtration for this daily driver.
I put my sports car to bed in the winter, battery would be dead with out this charger.  Needed an extension to reach the carI use this on my r1 during the cold days in winter or when ever i put the bike in to storage. Still working till now and this includes a spare wire to place a dis-connectable connector from your battery to the battery tender (which can be routed from your battery to your backseat compartment) Highly recommended.I used to take out my boat battery and bring it into the house to keep it trickle charged. With this extension cable I can now charge it right in the driveway without having to pull the battery every time!!! my back loves this
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceIt's a quick and easy way to have a battery hook up on your boat, motorcycle, four wheeler, golf cart, just about anything with a battery in it where you might could use a charger, or 12 volt outlet...WM
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Can never go wrong with slime stuff.Don't put too much in a tire or you will be able to feel it moving around when you ride...a dirt bike...for instance.Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them.
I bought this product to keep my motorcycle charged between rides.  I ride the bike pretty often so I probably don't need it but it does come in handy for those occasions when I go a week or more without riding, like when I am doing upgrades or repairs to the bike.  I just plug it in the night before a ride and in the morning the battery is fully charged and ready to roll.  Great product for a reasonable price.  I really like the jumper cables and keep them in  my saddle bag in case of emergencies!I have found few RV camp sites to be level. I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well. I always feel like the trailer is leaning when I walk around in it.With this bullseye level, I can place it on the trailer tongue or on the trailer floor as I do my leveling. I can quickly do the leveling with confidence. When I am done, I slip the bullseye in a drawer where it will be safe for my next trek.when I park for awhile or need to take my Engel refrigerator/freezer in my car into the house or hotel room, this does the trick of keeping it powered up.
Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.

Does what it says it does.  Easy to install, and once adjusted will bring your car to the exact same spot every time.  Fast delivery, and excellent quality item.Do what as it says and you'll get the results you wanted. don't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint. otherwise, this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxingProduct was exactly as described!  No defects or problems, recieved when promised, what you want when you order a product online. 2013 jeep jk 2 door
I got this an an extra after i Damaged the original and as expected it is a perfect fit!.  Good to have a spare sometimes!!!!.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!this is a great product from 3m I would tell any one who is going to do painting this is one tool you should have
Works great for smaller seals but it couldn't pull out the rear main seal for a 2002-2006 MINI Cooper. These are very large seals. The tool just couldn't provide enough leverage for that. I used a flat blade screwdriver instead. Perfect tool for small and medium size seals.Works ok, but is smaller size than the blue  ones offered here on Amazon. Due to the size difference the Blue ones are a much better value.This strainer works, but can't fit even full size plates! It also is very flimsy. I would find another one!
I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely

I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work.This polish really does a beautiful job on virtually any metal.I would guess I've been using this polish for over 30 yearsand have found there's pretty much no end to what this polish is good for.It gives a gleaming shine on:Brass ~ silver ~ copper ~ gold ~ chrome ~ aluminum ~ pewter ~ stainless steel ~ and more.It's not good on many painted nor plated surfaces as it may remove paint & plating.I can say from experience that it ruins/removes the gold or silver flashing on china.I use this on so many things that I keep tubes of simichrome in the house & garage for convenience.Plus carry it in both the car & truck as it's proven to be very use-full when antiquing.Especially for checking if an item is Bakelite.The pink polish will turn a yellowish (dark yellow to a canary) if it's Bakelite ~no matter what color of Bakelite your testing.The polish will stay pink if it's not Bakelite.While cleaning our un-hearted garage this past fall I found a particle tube behind a cabinetthat must have been there for over 20 years ~ and it was still fresh & worked like new!Freezing doesn't damage it, I leave it in the garage & autos years around.This polish leaves a protective finish so metals don't darken again as quickly ~while adding a beautiful shine.Some hardware stores carry this in 8 oz. containers.  It is a buck or two cheaper to order it here and have it delivered.  It works better than naval jelly.  Not particularly recommended for show quality applications.I pour a little our on a 2&#34; paint brush to coat rusted ferrous metal.It stops rust and turns it black.Good for tools and equipment that have a tendency to rust.It is thicker that some of the phosphoric acid products and leaves a coating that can be painted over.I am using it on a rusty utility trailer and an old tractor.You don't have to paint it but you can.It kills the rust.
This is one of my favorite Meguiar's products. I use it on the dashboards and external plastic and vinyl trim. Just give the bottle a good shake, spray on a little and wipe the surface to a brilliant, clean shine. Even after washing the car, when I use the Meruiar's Natural Shine the cleaning power of the product is evident by looking at the blackened cloth used to apply it.Here's a product that works so well, that it's a pleasure to use. I highly recommend Meguiar's Natural Shine Vinyl & Rubber Protectant.I love this stuff! I can't keep my car in a garage, so I use a car cover almost every day of the year. I hate going through the day long meticulous labor of washing, clay baring, and waxing my car more than a couple times a year, so I use this stuff. After washing and clay baring my car, I use the Mother's wax and throw the cover on. Each week I dust the car, and depending on the need I use this spray detailer weekly or bi-weekly. I don't know exactly what's in it, but I assume it's some sort of liquid wax. It really helps to preserve the original wax job and helps it last for months. It also cleans bird droppings, grime, and general filth gently and easily. Using it couldn't be easier. Just spray on, wipe with a microfiber cloth, and dry with another microfiber cloth. One bottle will last me two to three uses on the entire car, depending on how heavy I am with the application. An excellent product all around!I purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first.
The brush is made of a VERY hard plastic. It is intended to clean very hard areas, do not even think about cleaning something sensitive, this is for heavy use only.The Handle is a very cheap - but hard - plastic. One can easily notice the part where they got together, although I thought and wanted it to be wood, that'd be perfect.Bought to clean the studs on the wheel but not sure it it'll scratch them, probably not since it's just plastic. Looks like it will last forever!This is a great Mother's product and very easy to apply and polish. Seems to me like I am going through the bottle rather quickly. It works really well for a quick surface shine. Therefore if you want to touch the hood up quickly for a car show, it will do a great job. I dod not know how long the application will last. It also removes surface grit and contaminants very well.I bought this to replace a replacement cover. The old replacement cover was old, ripped and still smelled like the strong vinyl scent. This one is very nice. It is nice and smooth and feels good in your hands. It takes some muscle to install but once it is one there it looks good. It could be a tad cheaper but it looks well made. The stitching is solid and doesn't seem like it will come apart. It doesn't move at all once you place it on your steering wheel so you don't have to worry about that.
Speeds up the fresh water tank fill process.  It also speeds up filling the portable water jugs during dry camping.  It's really convenient to be able to turn the water on/off right at the jug.This dries my car very well and stops water spots from forming.I dried my car almost completely (Scion tC) before I had to squeeze water out of this towel. It really is a water magnet!
I waited to write a review on this product, because I wanted to try it on several different things besides greasy tools. So let me start by saying it works great on my son's greasy tools (he works on cars), it has taken off grease stains on my driveway, I used it on our gas grill and it worked great. I also used it on my stove top to get off cooked on grease stains, and to my surprise it worked great without damaging the stove top. The fact that it is biodegradable puts my mind at ease. I really love this stuff, and plan on purchasing more when I run out.I purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first.I've owned a black car for 25 years and keeping it clean and keeping swirls out for the paint is tough. So I bought another black car but this time I searched you tube for car care and found things about &#34;claying&#34; your car. I thought &#34;no way&#34; I'm going to rub a bar of clay on my black car, that would just scratch it to death. Well I was wrong, even after a good cleaning there is still dirt particles in the paint, just do the plastic bag test and you will see. I used the clay bar as instructed and it deep cleaned the surface and in turn I could seal the paint after the claying job. It does an amazing job on cleaning your paint. I have used it to remove scuff marks, bird doo, bugs, about anything that is on your paint.
I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.If it moves and it shouldn't, Loctite.  I like to use this for small items that I will need to take apart in the future, but I do not want to have loosen up during use.  Like tiny screws in a gun or something else small and hard to replace.I use it on every wash that I do.If your a car guy and keep your vehicles nice this is a great product.If your working on a vehicle that has been abused it may take you two or three times to get the wheels looking good.You may have to scrub the wheels by hand to clean off the real dirty areas, and possibly use tar and or bug remover to get them nice and clean.But once you do that, from there in all you need to do is wash the wheels down, spray the wheel cleaner on and let it sit for a few minutes and pressure wash it off. No need to hand wash.And the wheels look really nice.
The SG does all it's advertisd to do very well. Using the programable functions requires some effort. I'm glad I have it but haven't gone much beyond basics.The quality of this tool is very good and it hasn't fallen apart or given me any issues yet.If it does I will update my review accordingly.My only regret is that it's not made in the USA.This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...
This is a great hard wax.. I used it as a second layer on top of a polymer Wax, NXT 2.0, but it works fine as your primary (only) wax.as noted in the title, the bar is solid.  the lock body is some sort of resin (?) which seems like a good blow with a solid hammer could break apart.  The lock mechanism itself is decent and the unit functions just fine.  i just don't think it is worth the cost.  If buying one again, i would choose a more durable product for the price.  It looks solid from a distance and perhaps that serves as a deterrent too.Excellent wiping performance and a great price. This is for the rear of a Land Rover LR2. As good as anything from the dealer and inexpensive too.
If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.Keeps a 12 volt battery charged without frying it. Very compact and fairly priced. I like the fact that a carry pouch is included as well as a hard wired pigtail with an easy connect to the battery in question. Good for a motorcycle or airplane battery.Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.
I use this on my dark grey Ford Explorer because the Ohio license plates are white. This looks very nice on the dark vehicle and I have  not experienced any troubles with law enforcement in the state of Ohio for the shield being too dark.As title says - waste of time, money and calories. I have 08 BMW 335i Sport. Silver color. Have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images. Spent almost an hour, tried all different techniques. This product simply doesn't work. If you have a new car with nice paint, I would avoid buying this. It might work for some old cars which paint is in different condition, but not for me - sorry.P.S: I bought a full set of Meguiar's paint care, you can find my reviews on other products as well. What actually worked for me (somewhat) is Ultimate Wax and Clay Kit (contaminant removal kit), Clay Kit is very hard to apply though, but it works.I've used this product along with several other Meguiar's car are products and am aware of their quality reputation. Truth be told, I chose this product over the 3m glaze because it was available through Prime and I could get it delivered faster. I prefer 3m products and most likely always will.That aside, this glaze works very well. The glaze has the look of dark mustard. Several thin coats of this glaze provide a deep shine.I've used this glaze on a black colored vehicle and a white one. It almost seems as if the black car was excessively prone to picking up light lines(super thin scratches). This was not as noticeable on the white paint finish.This glaze is a good buy.
At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet.The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.Great hydraulic oil. Quality comes in an entire package. This includes the container, the pouring spout and the way the spout can be retracted with the cap on for storage. One can is enough to flush and refill the entire power steering unit.j After changing the fluid, my power steering is noticeable smoother and quieter. Very pleased with the performance of the product.
I like Mother's products. They are affordable, and work well when used correctly. The thing about mothers is it is not the best on the market, but as for price, availability, and ease of use any novice to car detailing can make a car look stunning.personal processI wash my car and used a clay bar to before using this product. The clay will remove heavy contaminants and prep the surface to be smooth. It so happens I use the mothers california gold clay bar kit which IMO is the best for the price. The detailer is just ok, the clay is great and so is the premium microfiber towel. The reason why I mentioned all of this is that you need to prep your car before starting to use the 1-2-3 system.So on to the actual review, the step one part they call a pre wax cleaner. If I'm not mistaken it is either a very mild type of car polish and may contain abrasives. Basically it will smooth out your cars surface, and make it shiny from the clear coat surface. I think it did a fair job making it shine and removing surface residue from the clay and detailer. It did an okay job so far with very light swirlmarks. since I am unfamiliar with other polishing compounds that I have been hearing about I will give this product of 3.5 rounded to 4 stars. just because I like it enough for the ease of use/money/amount and ending result. I may change the rating if I like other products I try in the future. but for this price and the amount they give (16oz) this will last me awhile because its 1-2 times a year use. now thats bang for the buck. On my Tc i estimate about 2oz was used for the entire car.Ok like most say it gets heavy but most polishers this size and are this weight. Its part of the machine. Whats nice with this is that it comes with rubber backing pad, and a velcro pad as well. It also comes with a real lambs wool pad. So its  price for it all,this is good. I just used it on a big RV project and it did a great job bringing the finish up very nice. It worked over a very large area 4 hours at a time. Well worth the investment. Seems heavy duty, Swich is soild not cheap. The instruction booklet is usless but my common sense figued out how to attach handles and change out different wheels.I would say its probally the best deal on here for the quailty at this cost. Time will tell how long it lasts but they do send and extra set of brushes to have a replacment should they burn out on motor. So thats cool too. Hope to never have to use them.This is one product that in my opinion is well worth the money. I just finished the hood on my car and the result is great. You can feel the grit and grime on the surface and once you apply this product the surface is as smooth a it can be not to mention how shiney it was. I then applied Mother's wax and now have a surfce better looking that the day the vehicle left the dealership.
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.I received it as a gift a few weeks ago, and am selling it again.There is no real benefit of having such a unit.First, the mounting is an issue as you have the cable running across your dashboard. Having a second plug on the right side is interfeering with gear shifting and whatever controls you have in your center console. It would be better to have a plug on the left side. Using the one in the back makes the cable run all across the dashboard, no thank you.Second, besides the tachometer (if you don't have one) what data readout do you really need? Really need? Nothing, exactly. Codes can be red out by any Auto place for free, and what are you doing if your converter speed is at a certain speed? Exactly, see what I mean? Okay, volts maybe, but just maybe.The unit, sent back to ScanGauge for testing, does hardly come on by itself, so you don't really know if any of the fuel/trip data is accurate. This makes it already questionable, and therefore I do not have any use for it.So, for us it is another item where we have to question its quality and reliability.Less than 1 month old, contact me if you want it. I take of 20% right away.First of all, the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second, once the car is started, you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display, indicating that a charge is occurring. However, this is a static icon, it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom. And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery. For this you need accurate readings, and I can not see these on this unit.
Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size.These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.
This gas cap does an admirable job of both containing the fuel within the tank and venting off excess vapor pressure.It is brand new and AC Delco branded. It comes with a tether as shown in the picture. It is a perfect fit.Not much else to say about it.Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.I use this to equalize the grey tanks when camping for 4 days or more. In cold weather we take showers in the camper so the grey tank in the bedroom fills up in 4 days.  This lets us divide the grey water from the kitchen with the one in the bedroom.  It also ads a little capacity because it stores water in the pipes down to the valve.  When dumping just take the cap off of this valve, install hose, close both grey valves, open this valve to drain pipes, drain black tank, open both grey tanks again, rinse and done.
What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.The products included in the kit are highly rated car care products. The variety of uses combined with the manufacturer's reputation make this kit a good value.I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware.
Fairly easy to install.  It took me about an hour.  It does what it is advertised to do.  Keeps 30 pounds of pressure in the water system so that the pump cycles less.  Tried it out today after de-winterized my TT.  Works.Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.Pros:Generous supply in 32 oz bottleWorks in fuel or mixed with engine oilSmells pleasant (minty, clean)Keeps cold engine start-ups slick and quickCons:Thin lubricantThins out your oilIt is a solvent, it MIGHT (no facts to support that possibility yet) deteriorateyour gaskets, seals.Claims:Cleans out engine, plugs, valves, and injectorsMY recommended use:8 - 10 oz per oil change(they recommend 20% mmo with engine oil change. That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off.
this is a very helpful tool that comes in handy when you think a spark plug has failed and isnt fireing and with this tool you wont have to wounder if the plug is bad or not and is worth buying and i recomend this tool to all do it yourselfers and mechanic shops as well thank youI bought this cover to use as a dust protector for my spare motorcycle that does not get much use. Because it is kept in doors I did not need a heavy duty cover. It does not appear that it would do well if put on a hot bike as the material is thin.For the price it is a good value, and it serves my purpose.Also Amazon's excellent service made me buy it.this is perfect for my truck the one that came with truck is very small and is difficult to remove lug nuts. with this its a breeze.like other reviews say the bag to hold the items that comes with this is very cheap and is probably not going to last to long but its not a deal breaker for me i don't need the bag.

Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommendThis line of filter is good to use in a cabin equipped air filter vehicle.  The fresh breeze has the charcoal to help eliminate odors.  This same filter at Toyota was 80 bucks.Change the oil yesterday and the oil filter fit perfectly in our 2003 Z4 3.0.  I'm glad that it comes with an extra o-ring for the oil filter canister and all paper is nice.
Fits perfectly in my 2003 BMW 3 series.  Has even helped the &#34;crayon&#34; smell German cars of this period tend to get.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!

Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI was looking for this air filter on the K&N website and went to AutoZone priced at 50-60 bucks. I put in my car info said, doesn't fit. BUT, it DOES fit my 2004 Crown Victoria perfectly.
Bought this for our 2003 BMW R 1150R.Even as a female I understand that Mobil 1 is THE standard for synthetic, and we would never buy another brand for any of our engines.I love Royal Purple and have used it for 6 years now.  I fail to understand how packaging of 12 quarts of product offers a cheaper customer $/quart than a 5 gallon container. From someone who comes from a manufacturing of consumer goods job this pricing structure is bogus.  Had the pricing been better for the 5 gallon on a per quart basis I would have rated my purchase of the 5 gallon a 5 star.i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter.

I think this is a decent replacement product compared to the much more expensive OEM brand.  It really does freshen the air in your car.  The only problem that I find is that the frame is made of cardboard instead of hard plastic like the OEM.This filter has a rough textured surface for a sure grip.  I have no trouble gripping it while installing or removing the filter.  The circular rubber ring around the filter is made of quality rubber, and the internal diameter of the filter is constructed of metal material, unlike some other filters which is made of cardboard like material.  Overall, when you hold this filter in your hands, you will know this is a high quality filter!  I highly recommend this product!The mk4 Beetles have a dashboard made of a ridiculous rubber/plastic material that gets sticky when the sun heats it up.  Why VW chose to use this material is beyond me, but I know that the mini california duster is the ONLY product I've found that can successfully clean the dust off of the dashboard.  It sounds trivial, but this is a really great product for the reason that it achieves what no other product can (or so I've found).
Installed on a motorcycle works great.  Cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging.  Great price.This is a great price for a replacement cabin air filter for my 2005 Toyota Corolla. It works fine and is easy to install (especially if you've done it before).Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.

It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it.What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know.
I use this Meguiar's Microfiber wash mitt strictly for the painted exterior parts of my vehicle and not the wheels to extend the life of it.  The wash mitt is a supersoft microfiber that will not scratch your paint.  It holds soap/water well so you dont have to keep refilling from the bucket.  The only minor complaint is the inner liner always comes out if you dont put your hand inside of it which i rarely do.  Eventually I'm going to get annoyed enough and cut the inner liner.  I think it would of been easier to just not have the inner liner.  Also to extend the life of the wash mitt make sure you clean out the dirt and soap with water and ring it out then let it air dry flat.If you are searching for a good, high-quality wheel cleaner, look no further! Not only is it pH balanced to ensure that you don't damage the finish of various wheels you may clean, its cleaning power is second to none. If you have a vehicle that generates a lot of brake dust (BMW, namely, but other vehicles that have fade-resistant brakes), you can spray P21S on the wheel wipe around with the provided sponge let sit for a few minutes and spray off and they'll look good as new. I occasionally (~50k miles) take off the wheels and clean the caked on stuff on the inside of the rim, too. It takes a bit more scrubbing but cleans it to make it look new every time. If you can't get this stuff to take whatever you have on your wheel, you will likely need to refinish the wheel - this stuff is the very best!KN 33-2370, I have KN's in all my vehicles.  This one is for a 2012 Camry and I'm sure it will fit the 2011 and perhaps the 2013.  In installing these in Toyotas you will see a cotton/carbon mesh filter that is not removable in the top of the airbox.  Its a post filter and I believe it has something to do with emissions on the newer Toyotas.  You can't remove this filter, nor should you.  Buy installing the KN filter you will eliminate the large cotton/paper filter in the bottom of the tray that is removable.  This filter is a denso brand filter typically, and is very restrictive.  When you get the KN you will notice that its not quite as tall as the OE filter and thats normal so don't be alarmed.After the installation, your computer will need to re learn itself and it may take as many as three key starts for it to understand that its now getting a bit more air.  I'd say within three days you would notice and improvement.  Some have noticed improvement immediately.  Most drivers with a tuned ear, will also here their engine become a bit more agressive sounding, this to is normal and will not cause damage.If your not running a flow through exhaust such as Borla or Flowmaster, the feeling of &#34;more power&#34; will not be as much due to the flow of air not being exhausted more freely.  However you are gaining more air on the intake side which is fine on its own.  You may also pick up some fuel mileage by installing the KN.  How much mileage varies on driving conditions and how you drive your vehicle.  When it comes time to clean the filter use kit 99-5000.  Clean the filter first as instructed, then allow it to dry fully, then oil it.  DO NOT over oil the filter- follow the directions.  If handled and cleaned properly these filters can go probably longer than the life of the car.  The filter by design allows more air to get introduced into the engine, and by its use of cotton and light oil, it captures more and smaller dirt particles that a typical filter would.  If you live in dusty conditions you will need to clean the filter more often than if its street use only.  These filters will not void your warranty and will help extend the life of your car.
Do yourself a HUGE favor and use a mass flow (MAF) senor cleaner to clean the MAF sensor.  DON'T use carburetor, fuel injector or throttle body cleaner or you'll ruin the MAF sensor.Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased.If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.
I've had 2 of these now for almost 1 year and getting another now. I'm keeping one in each car now and a backup in my garage. I've used it to jump my Honda Pilot more than 20 times over the past year. Kids leave lights on mainly. I don't worry anymore.- It takes me &#60;1min to pull this out, hook up and jump my car.- The battery lasts forever it seems. after 10 jumps still shows full power, but I charge it to full every few months just in case as I know with lead acid batteries if you get too low, it will create buildup and reduce effectiveness over time.- i've kept in my hot garage and inside my car without trouble (i keep it under some sheets in my car to prevent it from being exposed to direct sunlight). haven't noticed any problems or leakages over the year.I initially didn't believe it would work so well, but now I recommend it strongly to anyone as a backup. Never be stranded again.This thing really does work excellent.  I used it to cycle out old gas in plastic cans into my car.  The new CARB compliant cans take forever to pour because they don't have a pressure hole.  I put the can on the trunk of the car, and put the siphon in each end.  A couple of shakes, and it started flowing until it was empty.  It took about 3 minutes for 5 gallons.What it didn't work for was trying to siphon gas out of my generator back into a gas can.  The gas tank was too shallow and there wasn't enough room to shake the siphon to get a good flow.  If you have a pump with deflate on it, you can still use this to get it started.Worked wonders on old, old dried in dirty grease. I wanted this to try to clean a rug I have that I haven't been able to use for years. It is a super thick, tightly woven 100% wool rug with a great kitchen design of fruits and veggies in full color on a black back ground. Well.....9 years ago I spilled an entire vat of hot dirty deep fat frying grease on it and it completely soaked through. I also got very sick about that time and didn't get around to trying to clean if for at least 90 days and the grease had dried into it. I tried saturating it with other cleaners and Tide ans Wisk laundry detergents hoping it would get the grease out but it didn't. I didn't have the heart to throw it out so I held onto it all this time and I'm glad I did. That little throw rug cost $190 and I sprayed enough of this KRUD on it so it soaked through out the rug, let it sit for a few hours and all I did then was scrub it lighlty with a toilet bowl brush and it got all the grease loosened up and then I rinsed it out in the tub. It took a few days for it to dry because it is that thick but now I have it back in the kitchen and am loving having it back...... I then tried to remove old dried in yellow oil stain that had come from my washing machine when I washed too heavy of a load so the oil came from the machine and got into my favorite powder blue sweat shirt, and again, I tried Tide, Wisk and other cleaners and they didn't get any of it out, I sprayed KRUD on the spots, let it soak in and left it for an hour, then rinsed it out and the stain was gone....I'm thrilled. Between the rug and the sweatshirt this KRUD has saved me $230. They should call it "GOLD" not KRUD. I'm going to buy it by the gallon so I always have it on hand. You should too.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youDon't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!
These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom.  On some vehicles with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless.Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom.  On some cars with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless.
I've tried a lot of different wiper blades over the years and these are the best I've found so far. They do a great job and seem to last a very long time; especially if you wipe the contact surface with some rubbing alcohol once or twice a year. Work great in all seasons, they can get some ice build up but have yet to find a wiper that doesn't (maybe that's why really expensive cars have heated wipers).Silicone ADV, excellent flow and filtration..... What more could you want!? Been using these for years on a number of cars and wouldn't change it. I run 5k intervals and never have an issue. Use with confidence!I'm always looking for good household cleaners to make cleaning quicker and easier so I can spend more time doing fun things.  Krud Kutter is a very good cleaner for some things and not so good for others. It cleans grease from dirty outdoor furniture but will not remove all of the built up dirt from normal wear and tear. It will get some of the grease out of clothing if you apply a small amount, let it sit for a while, and then throw it in with the rest of the wash.  I didn't have any fresh grease spots on clothing to test it on, but it did partly remove some spots that were older, but not all.  I think the most impressive thing that it did was to remove most of the soap scum from glass shower doors after spraying it on, letting it sit a few minutes and then using a moderate amount of elbow grease. It took a second time and some serious scrubbing to remove the last traces. Since we have hard water here and soap scum on shower doors is a constant problem that I don't always keep after quickly enough, I was impressed with the job that it did.It does a very good job of removing glue left behind from price stickers on plastics or other hard surfaces. It didn't work all that well on dirty grout between tiles but it did remove some of it. It did a good job of removing ordinary dirt from counter tops and around the tub. It didn't remove burnt on stains on my oven door, even with a lot of scrubbing.  It does have an odor but it isn't overly strong.  I've come to expect some smell with any type of cleaner other than the oxygen cleaners which don't have much smell of their own.  But while those cleaners do a good job on organic stains such as food, blood or pet urine, they don't even touch grease.  I plan on purchasing more of this product and will use it to clean up greasy or sticky messes and to keep after the soap scum on our shower doors before it has a chance to build up again.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.There are many other products like the ctech but this is clearly one of the highest quality. The best part is there are optional wires that fit many needs or if you have multiple vehicles.
Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking.Seems a bit flimsy but works well .... I always hated leaving the hose in when it topped off and water spewed out I would need to run to the hose to turn it off while it was geyser of water flying out the side of my trailer .... I just wait till its full ... turn the shut-off valve off and I'm good to go wit no mess. Plus having a large valve at the end help with the hose not folding and crimping. For the price it does what it's suppose to do.The whole thing is made of plastic, so if you over tighten even the tiniest bit, you strip the plastic threads and you end with with a handful of plastic pieces that can no longer be secured to the hood of your car.It's a very fine balance between loose, snug, and too tight with this kit.  I was screwing the star nut by hand to tighten down the nozzle to the hood. I could feel the nut just getting a bit snug when all of a sudden the little resistance I was feeling went to nothing and then I realized that the plastic threads in the plastic screw had stripped out of the plastic nut.  So the left wiper nozzle now freely moves around the hood of my car despite trying to glue it down and use electrical tape to keep it one spot.  Very annoying since I barely put any significant amount of pressure on the nut.
I use this on older Lycoming engines where they used clamps with a short rubber hose between the metal tubes for the intake. This is much easier to snake around exhaust etc to the clamp then regular pliers.I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem.Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Use this for oil changes on my Subaru BRZ and it works great. Just stick the extension that has a smaller tube size right into the dip stick tube.
Used this during my Mazda Miata rebuild.Plan to keep in my toolbox in the future.The Good;Excellent product. It does workRelatively easy to use brush on underside of capHeatproofThe Bad;8 oz is probably more than I will use this lifetimeRequires a stir or two before use. Not a big deal, but worthy of noteI will buy againBought this and kit to install for use on tubeless tire motorcycle (Kawasaki C14 Concours)Used product on flat and was very easy to use and stopped the leak (had to use 2 plugs for a #10 screw hole)Hole did not leak for about 50 miles and then started to lose about 2 psi a day.Would recommend for roadside tire repairs, Also would suggest not for long term use for non simple nail / tack type tire repairs.OEM Package no great to store un used plugs after package opened. Someone suggested using tin foil to wrap the un used plugs once package opened.Would buy again for road side tire repair. Would not buy if you expect a permanent, safe, long term repair... just use product to get you home or to the repair shop.Got this to keep a charge on my daughter&#8217;s scooter. So far it starts when needed even if it&#8217;s been sitting for a while. Comes with a handy attachment to leave on the battery so you can just plug the charger in without a fuss.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Works good, installed on my 2012 Kaw Voyager 1700. I installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box. Use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work, sound awesome too.This does indeed store plastic bags - a few. It is small enough to fit on the inside of cabinet doors on my RV but it really doesn't hold many bags and leads to the obvious question - &#34;Why spend the money?&#34;. However it does work as advertised.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked. When disconnected, it also does not leak (it does not pressure out unless you pump it).This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Perfect fit and function on a 2003 BMW 325i - good buy, with Prime, its easy to plan purchase around oil changesWorks just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same carused on my 1994 ford f150 2wd 5.0 rear end. Would reccomend buying a new rear end cover and gasket when you perform this job. The fluid already has the modifier in it so, you will not be needing that. Price is the best I have found and the performance is crisp.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.This product fit perfectly on the oil filter cover on my 2011 Lexus RCX350  . This one works great, and makes changing oil a breeze.  Make sure you use synthetic 0W20, get an OEM filter element, proper plastic drain plug, and your ready to change your oil in less than 20 minutes.  On a Lexus, you will save at least $150 (after buying the oil and needed parts/tools).Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon.
This tool worked great removing and re installing the oil filter canister on my 2011 Toyota Sienna. It can't get better than thisDid not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same carThe filter in my car was getting smelly.  This Fram Fresh Breeze cabin air filter solved the problem very easily.  Will buy for other vehicles.
Before purchasing this item I called the manufacturer to be sure it did what I wanted.  They said it would but it did not.  i called them back and they said it was capable of what I wanted but I would have to program it for it to work.  Not what you read on the package, not what the manufacturer said, and directions so poor I could not beging to program it and I'm a geek.I am satisfied with this product, and what it does, because we all know how rust is and if we don't, let me say it can be a pain in the but you know what i'm trying to say, so to expect miracles would be beyond expectations.will use again.I use Royal Purple frequently, but when I saw this product I was confident, but wondered how well it would work. Without anything but a dumb temp. gauge I did see a decline in the apparent level of temp. So so far I'm happy. Thanks!
Before installing the level, make sure you are level with the camper first.  Also don't think that a top of one of the storage compartments is level because it isn't.  Once you put on the level, it is very hard to take off.  But I do like how it reads in inches.  It does make it easier to level the camper.This little thing works perfectly!  I use to use a pressure bleeder, but was concerned about what some people say, that pressure bleeders push more air into the brake fluid, which causes both more air and moisture to absorb into the fluid.  Best way is to press the brake pedal, or put a vacuum on the bleeder screws.  A vacuum would be nice, but also a lot more work to setup initially.Instructions say this check valve does not work on air, only brake fluid, but on empty systems you can still pump the pedal until fluid comes out, and run your drain side pipe into a container that has brake fluid at the bottom.  That way you only suck back up fluid, not air.  Once you have fluid in the lines, this is completely unnecessary.  Did all 8 bleed screws on a Brembo-equipped car, was effortless.  I completely trust this little check valve, hope it lasts.  Rinsed it out with simple green and then a little PB Blaster to keep it from corroding or whatever.Remember to buy a couple more yards of cheap 3/16" clear hose from the hardware store, so you'll never run out, and can throw away what you've used after each brake job.The included hose clamp is worthless, but you don't need it anyways.Another great trick to compress pistons is to crack open the bleeder screw first, then push in each brake piston.  Fluid will go out through this check valve, instead of fighting every other brake piston.  Makes life a LOT easier, and does not push old fluid back up the brake lines or risk overflowing your reservoir.I have used Stant locking caps for years on all my vehicles. This does fit a 2004 Ranger fine but the tether that keeps the gas cap attached to the truck will not work without modifications. There is no slot!........ I  removed the retaining ring on the bottom to see if I could modify it by trimming it down but if you trim it you will remove the ability to keep the ring attached.I ended up trimming the inside of my tether and slipping it over the top of the cap then super gluing a piece of electrical wire around the perimeter as a retainer. It's a lot of hassle to do but I didn't want to use it without the tether.One good thing, I was able to see just how they designed the locking mechanism in these. It is a engineering feat just short of genius, but it is not something that I really needed to know about.Anyways, it works as it should but only time will tell if it throws the check engine light due to a poor seal as some reviewers have stated on here. If it does then I will update my review.Some reviewers received 10510 caps with tether slots and some did not, which leads me to believe Stant must have made a new injection mold die but didn't provide any tether gap in it.Edit 11-12-2013: No problems with check engine light, it's a good seal.

Does a fine job. Only had to do it once last season.  We'll see how it works on a full seasonPurchased as a replacement for a 2004 Ford Taurus.  Lasted about 7 months before it burned out.  Replaced this item with NGK brand, OEM manufacturer.  I do not recommend this item if you plan on keeping the car.I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!!

I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.To say it completely didn't work for me, would be a lie. To say that it sealed my cam gasket leak on my 1995 Audi A6 2.8, would also be a lie.My car is still leaking oil, though it appears to have at least slowed down.I'm not sure if I should buy another bottle? Or just concede that short of replacing the gasket, this is as best it can get.
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderHighly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?
I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .Seems Well Made, You will need a regular Shop extension cord to use this. I use this to power a Macerator to pump out my RV Tanks into a holding tank in my pick up truck bed and then drive to the dump station so I don't have to tow my poop wagon at 2 miles an hour thru the gravel in the campground. I have not actually jumed a vehicle with this , but I did test it on my battery start tester and it performed very well.Good Cables and Clamps, I suspected the accuracy of the gauge but checked it against my Fluke Meter and it is pretty close.Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again,
Be advised, this bit is 3 and 1/2 inches long. Description says 5.7 inches long which is NOT correct.  Did not work with my air hammer. Its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release. So will have to return and get a longer one.If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.Perfect fit on Airstream trailer. I use it when the standard footer is too long.  This shorter foot is ideal when parking on an incline and the hitch is too close to the ground.
I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater, as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location.  If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense, let me save you the time -- in my case, the better part of an afternoon.First, a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play: 1) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater, 2) a secondary plug that screws into the first, and 3) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water.  I believe the intent of this design is to allow &#34;regular&#34; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve, while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly (due to the larger diameter).  Sidenote: opening the actual valve (the smallest component) drains the tank very, very slowly, and sometimes only at a trickle if you can't get air behind the water -- in my case, I had to open the pressure relief valve (in addition to all faucets) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking, the other components did.  I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape, and at various depths.  No matter what the combination, there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces.  There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking.  I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape (5+ wraps), to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering, returned the valve to Amazon, and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug.  Hint: Sears sells a 15/16 offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs.I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers.I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.
i have a jeep XJ cherokee with about 6" of lift and 33" tires.  I have a 48" hi-lift jack.  I got the smaller one mainly b/c of space as i wanted it to fit under my rear seat in my jeep.  With the 48" i can use my front bumper or my rocker rails as jack points, however it would be pretty difficult to get a tire off the ground unless i maxed out the jack.  This item helps a lot to raise the wheel off the ground and be able to put something underneath the wheel for better traction like a log or rock.  My only small complaint is that there is a nut that holds this onto your hi-lift.  would be better if the nut was a bit longer and that it came with a wing nut instead of a lock nut.  Otherwise the build quality is very good, it has a rubber pad that goes up against the tire.  The hooks are extremely strong and the straps are stitched very very well.Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.I've had Husky liners in several vehicles and swear by their fit and longevity. Only drawback is the tread depth is not particularly great. While the sides are adequate for keeping any slush you drag in confined to the liner, sometimes (but certainly not all the time) your shoes will be sitting in the mud/slush/water. No big deal to pull em out and dump em, but could be perfect with even just another 1/4 inch of tread depth.Other than that, the plastic is of perfect ridgity to mold to the contours of your Jeep and the colors are steadfast for a very long time. Have both the front and rear liners in my JKUS.
For most folks but if you need it and fail to use it really bad things will happen.I bought a Porsche where the previous owner had changed the plugs and failed to use the anti--seize and years later when it was time to change the plugs because you cannot actually see the plugs it is easier to remove the head to put repair helicoils into the aluminum as the plugs will not come out without taking the threads.  This is how the world works.  Failure to install something whre this product is needed will cost you dearly down the road. Before you begin anything with aluminum first find your bottle of anti seize so you know you can put the project back together without doing permanent damage.MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5I was simply delighted to FIND purple locktite. I needed the right product for set screws on rifle scopes. Purpose locktite is not to be had in local stores. Go for blue and you commit your set screws. I needed something that I could use with a small screw and remove if I needed to without stripping anything or resorting to heat guns. This is PERFECT.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking.This thing is pretty basic. You essentially create a girth hitch with it. You pass the strap around an object, then you take the standing part of the strap and grab a loop of it and pass it through the sewn loop at the tag end of the strap. Then you slide this thing between the standing part and the sewn loop, and when you tighten the strap, the bone prevents the standing part from sliding back through the sewn loop, essentially creating a knot. Any sailer will be familiar with this system it's used alot in quick release knots.
Both of my older cars had their factory nozzles falling apart thanks to arizona sun. I ordered these, funny they are same help brand sold at the zone, and installed them in 1 minute. They work great, yes you adjust them by just pushing the metal nozzle around, which you can do with factory nozzles as well. I prefer these spray pattern over factory. Factory was just like 2 streams, like a water gun, these are two fans of spray. The factory streams barely covered the window, these cover the whole thing in 2 seconds.I always use genuine gm parts in all of my vehicles and never have any problems. The wire set came with dielectric grease in the boots to protect the spark plug and wire so they can be remove easily.These hose clamp pliers are a godsend.  It makes easy work of getting those spring type clamps off where they usually are tucked in the most inopportune places.  I do like the pliers however I would additionally recommend getting a set of bent tip needle-nose type pliers as well.  I find myself grabbing the bent (angled tip) needle-nose for the majority of my spring hose clamp work and using the cable type for ones that are just too far deep in the engine bay.These work great for undoing the lower radiator hose clamps in many cars.  I think every serious mechanic should have a set of these.  No problems with the quality.
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
I did not install yet.  It looks like it will work fine.  I'll let you know when I am done.Update is that it works as intended!I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.Makes seal very slick and shiney should do a great job protecting the rubber seals, dont know how long it will last untill it has to be reapplied, but will let you know
If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations, this is it. If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it. Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt. Its going to shine. Great automotive or household maintenance product.What you will be getting is Castrol DOT 4 Synthetic oil which you can get at the local auto parts store for half this price.Castrol GT LMA is the old name of the same product. When I called auto part stores for Castrol GT LMA they did not have it because it's the old name they are not familiar with.Although it should be included for free with the Jack this item is a must have and reasonably priced.  Careful it's also easily stolen.
Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!Great spark plugs, the exact type my motorcycle required.  Very good quality plugs, gap already set appropriately.  They all come cylindrical cardboard tube over electrode to protect plugs while in the box.  So you have no worries of your box being dropped and cracking your porcelain around the electrode.Very clean, crisp threads and installed in motorcycle heads with ease.INSERT tip:  using a 3/8" rubber hose approximately 6-8" long, slide it over the top end of plug and use to insert plug into place.  If you begin to cross thread during insertion the rubber hose will slip around plug.  Whereas, with a ratchet one might be apt to keep tightening at this point, thus ruining the female threads in your cylinder head.ChrisEastern NCNo more fishing around the back floor board on those long trips !but do be careful if you fold the rear seats forward, they could catch the headrest.
In order to replace the oxygen sensor, I needed a way to tighten in the new unit. While this could also be used to remove the old one, the slot in the side weakens the structure which could result in breakage. To avoid that risk, just cut the top half off the old one and back it out with an air wrench and impact socket. Then this socket installs the new one without damage.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.
This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.I like that you can shut off the flow out the funnel.  This is handy because if you know the amount of oil needed, say 20 ounces in your lawn mower, you can measure 20 ounces by the markings on the funnel, open the valve with a quick twist, and watch it go in.  It even has a little screen at the outlet to keep any debris that might get in there, from getting into your engine.A lid for the top, and a cap on the end of the hose, keeps the dust out when not in use.  The flex tube going down is easily flexed, but can kink if bent too sharply.  That is OK, though, because a tube that would be harder to kink would likely not be as flexible, or as transparent.Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.
Bought these to give my scissor jacks a more solid platform to rest on.  They are barely large enough to hold a standard 24" scissor jack shoe for a 16 foot travel trailer.  Recommend you consider this when buying.  Had Camco made them literally 4" longer, I'd give them a 5 star review for $15.I've had a few Battery tender juniors for a years and they work great. It was just never convenient to leave them charging all the time with the little box just laying on the floor.Now that I have a reason to have four chargers, I sprung for this big boy. It is worth the extra money just to have a centrally located charging station and be able to look at a glance to see the status of each battery.This comes with four battery terminal/fuse harnesses and four alligator clip harnesses, but buy an extension if you need more than 6 feet of length.I originally purchased this item for use on one vehicle but thought it to be quite a bit longer than it needed to be. So I actually got the bright idea to cut it in half and use it for two vehicles. Works great for both! So unless you are driving some kind of monster truck, buy one cut it in half and use on two. BTW these are not small cars. One is an SUV and one is a full size luxury car.So far so good. Will update if things change.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!Bought this to allow the use of the std Tender for an outside car, run this from the garage to the driveway, works just the way it is supposed to...Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).
I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price.This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.
My dealer had put a plate frame on my motorcycle when I bought it but it covered part of the info (numbers and State) which is not legal in NC. I liked the look and price of this one and bought it. And it looks nice and frames the plate without covering any of the info on the plate. I did have to use a snipper to cut off the top of two of the barbs to get the screws in but you can't tell.This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.DixitI learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface.  Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.

The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.
Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.I bought two of these one for mysely and the other for my son inlaw. Both will be used for a flag pole mount on the back of his truck an the other on my motorhome. Put threaded rod through the ball mount hole ant PVC pipe on the threaded rod .It works out great.Cant beat the price for this mount and PVC is cheap.I replaced a rear sensor in a 1999 camry 4 cyl with this sensor to eliminate a check engine light failure.  It was easier than using an identical replacement because the cable ran through the floor pan under the driver's seat.  By using this I just cut the wires underneath the car, spliced them with included splices and heat shrink and added a layer of self-sealing rubber tape to protect and waterproof the splices.  No more check engine light for about $30.Update: Replaced the rear sensor on my 1998 camry also with perfect success - they went bad on both cars at around 120000 miles.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.There are two horns, not one.

Until you use it you can not comment on it.Others have told me it works great for getting a flat fixed until you can make it to a repair shop.I have never had a flat or needed to use anything like this before.But wanted it for my Harley Sportster.  Better to have it than call a tow truck.bought this for my CRV originally. now still works with my Honda Pilot. has lasted 5+ years and still going strong. holds the front weight of the car easily. just line it up right and drive slowly up the ramp. it can take a beating and is very hard plastic.i can change my own oil now easily and for dirt cheap yet high quality.extremely satisfied. would highly recommend. (if you are tight on a budget just park half on a curb and it should give enough space underneath, but this lets you do it in your own garage in a much nicer fashion)ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO HAVE WHEN CHANGING OIL:- a couple jack stands (i always use this as a backup as never good to have a car fall on you)- 4 tire chocks to prevent rear tires from moving by accident (always use parking brake as well)- socket wrench (walmart extendable one is solid)- oil and oil filter- gloves and lots of newspaper to prevent oil messes (definitely will be some)- oil pan (walmart has a solid large one. the bigger the better. should have built in spout)- about 1 hr of time... drive it around a bit first to warm up oil so it flows faster, careful as it will be hot)- channellock tongue and groove plier in case you need help to remove the oil filter (it is crazy tight initially but doesn't have to be)Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.I have this item hooked on my motorcycle with the loop connection, so it can be quick hooked or unhooked for summer time.
I wound up spending $200 or more replacing my Vent Valve Solenoid, purge valve and Evap Canister because I was sold a defective AcDelco GT276 gas cap. I got the dreaded p0400 code and learned the first thing to check is the gas cap. Bought the Delco brand because of the tassle and hoped that it would be the same as the oem cap. Well, it's not!After replacing the gas cap and getting the same code a couple weeks later, I began to try and troubleshoot the EVAP system and quickly learned that it is a booger...After spending the time and money to replace the above mentioned parts and continuing to get the SES light and monitoring results thru my system/code reader, I turned my focus back to the Gas Cap. I had noticed that the tension on the cap before it began to click wasn't even as strong as the old oem cap I had replaced. At my wits end , I decided to go ahead and purchase the STANT brand gas cap and give it a shot. I read some good reviews about Stant. The new cap arrived and the tension and fit on it was 10 times better than this cap. After replacing with the Stant cap, I monitored the cars system and it PASSED the EVAP check. At that time I felt relieved that I found my problem, but I was also peeved that I had spent $200 on other parts because of this defective cap. So I would advise anybody out there to buy a Stant instead..... Oh, and the Delco is made in GermanyBought this to use for a camper, It works as a hose, but the ends are plastic.  Initially, I didn't have a problem with this, but at one campground the end was fused to the spigot at my campsite.  I had to use a wrench to get it to release, this damaged the end and I had to buy a new hose.  Also, before this happened it was difficult to get the hose to not leak through the connection.  Defnitely, I recommend getting a hose with metal ends.I check the ATF fluid on my newly acquired Acura.  The color of the fluid was not too dark, but the level was low.  The shifting of gears were not too bad, but I do hear a drone/hum.  There is a slight vibration when I put load on the tranny which makes me uneasy.  Record shows the ATF was serviced about 10K miles ago.  The car is normally driven by my wife, and this past weekend, when I drove it, I could really tell the vibration was getting more severe.  I did not want to take any chances, so I had the car parked until the transmission fluid was done.  I order the Red LIne D4 from Amazon with next day delivery.I drained the old ATF and refilled with Red Line. The difference is night and day.  Shifting is so much smoother and the vibration is gone.  I am going to do the 3X3 flush, but I am going to take my time.  I'll do the next flush in a month or two...I highly recommend this product!

I truly don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. Take the guess work outta knowing weather your tires need replacing or will pass inspection. Can't go wrong with this one.bought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date.Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.
This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same carAmazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander

Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Bought this to use with electrical connections on a tail light assembly for a cargo carrier.  It works as described and was a good price.  This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.I am sure this will work fine next fall when I put the bikes to sleep for the winter. I borrowed a can of fogger from a friend of mine for this winter.
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Works just like it needs to.

How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...Bulk hose, what else is needed to say? Right size and fuel rated. Now to add words so they accept it as being long enough.I have this unit, then I bought a Bosch unit that was a disaster (have a review on here as well). This ctek is just perfect.  I bought the bosch because it was on sale, but that was just a waste of cash.  these ctek units are simply fantastic and work as you would expect.  They work as designed but also as you would expect (e.g. - memory when power goes out, it knows what it was doing last and will go back to it)
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows.I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy!
This rain suit is awesome for the money iam a motorcycle safety instructor and this is the kinda of product i recommend new students purchase its made great and can be seen in the rainthis hose feels really sturdy, used it to fix old boat (sold it though), fix transmission and steering lines in cars. this is high quality hose, made in USAI purchased this wheel lock punch for my newly acquired OEM wheel locks i purchased from Amazon. The only thing i hate about this pouch is that it is not made of the material depicted in the picture. It is made out of Nylon.
This filter combined with an Airaid MRT helped my 2004 Tahoe make a little more power and sound like it has a V8 under the hood! The filter fit nicely and should provide plenty of filtration for this daily driver.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.I bought this filter for my 2007 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic. This is a high quality filter that fit perfectly with no issues. The bolt head welded to the top of the filter is a awesome little touch! Thanks K&N.
This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used. It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available. Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this. Check on forums for you car if you're unsure.I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank.  Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon.  But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work.UPDATE:  I was able to actually use this in my generator afterall.  I had to insert the hose at an angle to reach a certain part of the gas tank and it worked like a charm. But, you need to use the up/down motion really really fast to start it off and then it will siphon. I guess it takes a little practice and a little patience. Once you get it right you'll have no problem doing the next time. I keep this in my truck now in case I ever need it.I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface.  Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.
Bought this and kit to install for use on tubeless tire motorcycle (Kawasaki C14 Concours)Used product on flat and was very easy to use and stopped the leak (had to use 2 plugs for a #10 screw hole)Hole did not leak for about 50 miles and then started to lose about 2 psi a day.Would recommend for roadside tire repairs, Also would suggest not for long term use for non simple nail / tack type tire repairs.OEM Package no great to store un used plugs after package opened. Someone suggested using tin foil to wrap the un used plugs once package opened.Would buy again for road side tire repair. Would not buy if you expect a permanent, safe, long term repair... just use product to get you home or to the repair shop.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.Used this during my Mazda Miata rebuild.Plan to keep in my toolbox in the future.The Good;Excellent product. It does workRelatively easy to use brush on underside of capHeatproofThe Bad;8 oz is probably more than I will use this lifetimeRequires a stir or two before use. Not a big deal, but worthy of noteI will buy again
I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket).This is perhaps one of the best air chucks you can buy. True, it isn't cheap and you get what you pay for.Unfortunately though, it does not work 100% on the dualies on my motorhome, which is why I bought it. Turns out, I need the chuck version that has a straight inner tire chuck and angled outer tire chuck. This item has both angled inner and outer chucks.But I can buy a replacement chuck (which Amazon does not sell), or a combination chuck with 12&#34; hose (which Amazon does sell), so I can retrofit the chuck for my type dualie setup.I am giving it 5 stars because I simply ordered the wrong item, so I am not going to gig the product because of that. Amazon though could describe the products a bit better rather than making me go to the vendor's website and looking up the product number to see which one is what I need.Got it to replace the Air Filter on my Mitsubishi Evolution X. After a little research came across people saying this one would have the same same size.Well, it DOES. And is EXACTLY the same as the OEM Mitsubishi uses it but for 1/2 the price! Since FRAM is a very well-known brand for any kind of filters, this is the way to go! I wouldn't be suspect if someday people tell me that this IS the OEM, but without the Mitsubishi logo on it.Cleans well the air and since i'm a user of contact lens, any dust gets my eyes red. After changing, my eyes are much better.
I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...This accessory makes it easy for one person to fill up the RV water tank.  The clear hose stays in the tank filler neck and the shut-off valve puts water control where you need it.To keep plastic water pipes from freezing in winter, this device is used to blow any excess water out the pipes.  Easier to use and cheaper than using marine antifreeze.
I recently purchased this item to use for off road recovery while using the Hi-Lift jack. It's well made, heavy duty and should work just fine!Very heavy duty plastic and solid construction.  These work as advertised (using on a 16 foot 2700 pound travel trailer with 24&#34; tires).Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletThis adapter works, but the clips do not open wide enough to clamp on my battery posts. I was able to attach to the cables coming off the posts, albeit barely adhering.Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.
I'd consider myself a novice in the personal car care crowd.  When I was ready to sell my 13 year old Honda CRV and I poured through amazon and other website for the best stuff to detail my car, to get the best resale price, and I came across this product.  I took the online advice of others and I can't say I'm more pleased.  Using this product on my honda made it look only a few years old and brought the plastic and vinyl pieces back to life.  On the interior, the dash was super slick but no oily.  I even used it on the exterior of the car.  The black plastic bumpers had faded to a light gray, but when I applied the vinylex, they went back to black.  Anyways, I did get top dollar for my honda using vinylex and other car car products.  I hope this review can help others.Went onto a 1995 Honda Civic.  My wife needs to get used to the shape of this style  of wiper.  We have had one day of rain and she said they worked. The true test of a wiper is in the long run and I can't address this since I have only had the wiper for a few days. Many years ago I bought an expensive Bosch wiper and the cheapest Trico I could find for my Honda Accord. I put them on on the same day. The cheap Trico outperformed and outlasted the Bosch. I am hoping to have better luck this go.I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville
This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.This rain suit is awesome for the money iam a motorcycle safety instructor and this is the kinda of product i recommend new students purchase its made great and can be seen in the rain
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
this product is as good as the turtle platinun, carnauba Meguiars. and the prices are similar as well as the quality of the three brands, the brightness of the car depends on the quality of the painting and not the wax. for this reason the high prices of other products can not be justified, after several years of experience in this field I recommend fulfill any of the three, I recommend waxing every month depending on weather and if the car is exposed or not the sun ..I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers.I am impressed with the quality and ease of use with no air leakage when checking the tires.Buy the rubber cover, that should have come with the unit. The quality overrides the high price.It is easy to read the gauge without glasses and the pressure bleed works well.
I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!I wanted a stand with the double lock and this is it. Have been using it since purchase and have had no issues. Great value.
I purchased two cases to handle oil service for an older Boxster; for this purpose there is no cheaper way to get an approved lubricant.When used instead of a 5W30 oil in two 2002/2003 VWs, in moderately cool but not cold temps, noticed easier starting and generally fine performance.At the Amazon price, especially with prime, there is no more affordable way to get this quality of oil.Two alternatives to consider for Porsches:If you are racing a street car, or observing much reduced change intervals, consider Joe Gibbs DT40 or similar, though it does cost even more than this Mobil 1 choice.Another approved and worthy choice for Porsches and other European performance cars is Motul 8100 x-cess 5W40, and this is also sometimes available via Amazon as well as in 5 liter package.This may be something that would be nice to have in your emergency pack, but it is small, toylike and not really functional as a "flare"  The light that is generated is bright in both the flash and continous shine mode, but the light is directional.  It projects basically in one direction as opposed to being a genuine flare style that projects in a 360 degree radius.  For a carry-around for emergency use it would provide some help, but I think there are better flameless flares on the market that would work better.  This is a lower cost item, so you may want to consider that when you make a comparison.  I give it three out of 5 stars but I can't recommend it to anyone who may consider this to be a complete emergency flare solution.There are heavier-duty covers that would be more appropriate for daily use where you don't have protected parking (like apartments or townhouses), but I have a garage, so a cover isn't necessary at home. However, if you travel regularly, this cover is convenient to pack (it comes with it's own little storage bag), doesn't take much in the way of storage space, and is excellent protection against rain and dust when covered parking isn't available. I just added another touring bike to my garage, so this will travel with it. Do not consider using it on a bike that's being trailered, this is a very-general purpose cover, and there's too much loose material for it to be a good choice for a bike being towed at highway speeds.
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it.This rain suit is awesome for the money iam a motorcycle safety instructor and this is the kinda of product i recommend new students purchase its made great and can be seen in the rainCame in 2 days, was $4 cheaper than the store product. Came in appropriate packaging. What can i say i liked it i hope that is 20words
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.This works much better than any dinky siphon pump they sell on this site and at auto zone.This makes changing rear differential fluid much easier!  If you don't have a drain plug or the cover does not remove you can suck out the old then add new using this unit too.If your transmission does not have a drain plug and you want to change whats in the pan you can suck out from the dipstick tube and add new.This tool has come in handy many times and has not developed any leaks.Pros:-Helps you get your wheels off.  Then you can fix your own brakes, paint your calipers, or swap wheels!-Has 4 wrench sizes, which work for both metric and SAE lug nuts.-14&#34; provides adequate leverage for easy removal and installation of lug nuts.-Inexpensive!Cons:-Doesn't remove lug nuts for you.-Doesn't put your lug nuts back for you.The only way to make this wrench better would be to make it much longer (20&#34; or something), or to include a mechanic to do all the work for you (expensive).
Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank.As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!  The AC power supply works as advertised but the inverter cooling fan is rather noisy.  You can hear it from one room of the house to the other.  The LED light is smart as LEDs use very little energy.  There are consistent complaints about the air compressor taking forever to inflate a tire.  The problem is not in the air compressor but the little black nipple at the end of the house.  One must, with the lever first up, push the inflation fitting all the way onto the tire valve stem by twisting the fitting and gently pushing until  you can see none of the brass fittings and then push down the lever to connect the hose and open the valve on the valve stem.  If you do this correctly, you will see the actual tire pressure currently in the tire on the air pressure gauge.  If the air hose fitting is not on the valve stem properly, when you turn on the inflator, the air pressure will initially say 0 psi until you turn on the pump and then the pressure will jump up to 100psi.  What is happening in this situation, is that the air compressor is trying to push against a closed valve.  It will VERY SLOWLY push air into the tire.  Make sure you have the fitting right and it will work very quickly.  Black and Decker should put a better air hose fitting on the end of the hose to eliminate this issue.As stated, everything works.  Ultimately, I will use the dc receptacles to charge the device via solar panels through a charge controller.Update as of 9/19/2009I have had this unit for some time now and have been charging it via the 12 volt cigarette lighter with a small 30 watt array using two Sunforce 15watt panels in parallel.  I use a Sunforce 7 amp charge controller to protect the battery in the device. I can easily charge this unit in about 6 hours from a depleted point at which the inverter auto shut off to protect the battery the night before.  I get 5 to 6 hours of light from a standard torche lamp in my living room with a 23 watt cfl installed.  I recently started charging it in parallel with a old jump starter pack I had been given as an anniversary gift at a job. If I am only using 6 hours of the sun, I am not storing all the energy I can.I now run the Electromate in the living room for about 5 hours to power the lamp and the Jump start pack gets a 75 watt inverter plugged into it and I run an identical setup upstairs in my computer room.I want backup power in an emergency and a very good way to get the bugs out is to use it continually so the problems will pop up at I time when I don't really need emergency power, instead of at the most inopportune time.This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess.
Fits fine on a greased 2&#34; ball.  The plastic or vinyl is very flexibile, and can be squeezed to create a slight vacuum to help it glide into place. Otherwise the trapped bubble of air underneath needs to be worked out before it fully seats.Recommended.I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.

Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.
This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.This plug is a must if you winterized your own trailer to blow the water from the lines so they don't freeze.You can't go wrong with these and should place them on all vehicle battery terminals after cleaning them. They are very easy to apply; red on positive, green on negative, between the battery and the terminal, on the post. Do this quickly as the car computer may require reprogramming if you do it too slow; if that happens it is easy to reprogram, just read your owners manual (it can alter window and door lock function). Before you start blow across the vents to dissipate and vapors that could explode with sparking, wear protective glasses and protective clothes (long sleeves) and wash your hands after.  The liquid in the cells is very acidic and will eat through clothes and skin. This is a good time to add distilled water to the vent holes. Do not top them off but bring the level to the bottom of the venting ring; leave space to vent the gases, there is a slot. Close the cell caps. Use a wire brush on dirty or corroded or fuzzy (usually a white or green powder) terminals and connectors.  Check your electrolyte, if you know how, to see if your battery is weak or has low/bad cells. If you have a lot of corrosion, cap the vents and mix about a tsp. of baking soda in a glass of water and brush it on with a toothbrush (if you get any in a cell it will kill the battery), it will foam up if there is acid, then rinse and dry before placing the washers and terminals. Remove the ground first, place the felt washer, replace the terminal, then place the positive. Reset your clock and anything with memory (GPS). Prepare for winter. If your battery is past the expiration date, replace it so you don't get stuck somewhere. Most good batteries do not live past their expiration date and can't be relied upon. Walmart and Costco batteries seem to be the most reliable according to reviews.
simple, logic and easy to use.  a useful tool to read data from the computer on your car, read codes and diagnose by yourself with a little search on the web. you can take note on the different indicators to know the "normal parameters" of your car, and notice when any change occurs and an error code lights your CEL, that way it will be easier to tell what went wrong.The only con is that there isnt any cable or software to connect to a PC or laptop- that would make it a better tool.i have the 2004 lex rx330 and right in it goes.  if you need directions, go to youtube to see the fine fellow demonstrating it.  you cant go wrong son.What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know.
I applied this based on other users responses.  It seemed to soften the leather.  I will see how it goes with continued usageHow can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell.
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.Be advised, this bit is 3 and 1/2 inches long. Description says 5.7 inches long which is NOT correct.  Did not work with my air hammer. Its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release. So will have to return and get a longer one.I wish the tool was about an inch longer. For a 1995 VW Jetta, with the tie rod inserted, I can't clip the wrench part in place because the tool is about a quarter inch too short. It's still usable but the wrench part won't clip in place so there's a lot more fumbling around.
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Bought these to give my scissor jacks a more solid platform to rest on.  They are barely large enough to hold a standard 24" scissor jack shoe for a 16 foot travel trailer.  Recommend you consider this when buying.  Had Camco made them literally 4" longer, I'd give them a 5 star review for $15.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
When ordering this ball I didn't realize the dimensions. I know they come in two sizes, but didn't realize how big it really is until I opened the amazon box today...no biggie, it'll still work. If your planning on doing rims or small areas, you should get the little guy! Great buy though.......These little things are really cool, so I would recommend them if you don't mind drilling out your plate mounts. I just wonder what kind of idiot would use larger screws in their product than the US standard.Once you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it.
When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it...I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)Works great.  Gaskets... Small leaks... Temp fixes or permanent.  The uses are endless.  It's a liquid rubber that dries into an oil resistant gasket.  What's not to like ?  If you lose the cap, you can even make another one out of the substance.I don't need to do a long review to convey the basics that this pin works perfectly to secure your hitch to the receiver.  There's a little anodized flare, and a decent little rubber cap to keep the grit out of the lock mechanism and it's stainless steel to boot!  Nice quality item.
It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engineThis product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank youI needed a decent filter wrench for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel.  The filter is up beside the engine and is best reached from below.  This wrench grips the round Amsoil Filter, Which is not wrench friendly with it's smooth surface. It holds the filter securely while I turn it with my 3/8&#34; ratchet using a nine&#34; extension.  Make sure you get the right size range for your filter size.
I bought this extension cable so I could reach my motorcycle. My garage only has one outlet in it and it's on the other side of the garage. I didn't want to move both cars just to be able to plug in my bike to charge. The extension cable has a great length and durable feel to it.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good priceI am not a good mechanic, I don't even pretend to play one on TV. Mostly I am somebody who is sick of paying $80 to the local mechanic to find out the gas cap is cracked or some $10 part needs to be replaced. I finally decided to buy a code scanner to facilitate my repair efforts.---THE GOOD STUFF---* The unit worked right out of the box on both my 2006 Subaru Outback and my 2002 Jeep GC. The hardest part of the whole deal was finding the port on the Subaru. (Tip-look under the hood release).* There seems to be a whole INNOVA website that they want you to go to for help translating the numeric codes into English. So far typing every code I have seen into Google has brought back more information than I know how to use. Not sure how this works for more serious mechanics who might need access to technical bulletins, but for us Saturday morning driveway hackers, it is fine.* The unit seems reasonably well made, although not sure it would stand up to the day-to-day use of a professional. For us "couple times a year" mechanics, it seems fine.---THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF---* There are no directions included, only a CDROM. The CD doesn't even have the directions, but points you to a website. Actually it doesn't even do that, instead it loads an application onto your computer and the app has a link built into it to get you to the website. Kind of convoluted and time wasting.* Plugging the scanner into your USB port kicks off the loading of a driver. No warning, and no idea what it loaded. I hate that.* The box could really do with a quick-start guide. Really all you need to know is how to plug it in, when to power (not start) the vehicle, and what the little buttons do. Would fit on an index card. Instead it is a 15 minute software deal.---SUMMARY---It seems fine for what I want it to do, namely just scan codes quickly. The whole PC/CDROM could have just as soon been skipped. For my use, no reason at all to plug it into the computer, and the installed app just looks like trouble.Ideally a quick-start guide, or better yet, some abbreviated instructions printed on the back, would have made this so much easier for a first time scanner user. That is the reason for the 4 stars and not 5.No idea how robust the unit is, or how long it will last, but I will probably lose it or drop it before it "wears out".
I have had several of these items . I like to have a inverter with a tire pump . Cost was a big factor for me in my younger days . However I now carry this , and a separate air pump that has battery clamps by viar . I am much happier and simply use my generator or a 12 volt led lamp . I used this during the past winter 4 or 5 times to jump start my van with a 351 and it cranked right up from dead after sitting and the charger coming undone . It barely took a charge this spring after I went to charge it after neglecting to do so all winter using it . This will never let you down . I believe it will last years and I love having one in each vehicle for the safety as well as to help others at church or the store that are less fortunate . A great investment and safety item for any family . Pay the extra you will be very happy if starting cars is your main need . Use a viair air pump and buy a battery clip one attachment into a 12 volt plug which will give you the leangh to go around your vehicle and will fill your tires in less then a minute . Do not use the 12 volt outlet for the viair air pump  it can't handle the amps in most cars . This pack is limited to 12 amps output so do not try to  use it either for the air pump unless it is a life and death emergency . When you use those air pumps you need to go off the battery with the car running . Be careful watch where the cord is with the moving parts .So after reading the great reviews here I bought this item at Wal-Mart and took it home to charge my deep cycle marine batteries.Worked fine for about an hour, then I noticed that it seemed to be stalled at 85% charge.  I did some more internet reading and discovered that this is a common problem with this unit, the readout stalls at a given percentage and never changes unless you unhook it and rehook it to the battery.  I did that and instantly the readout changed to 100%.So now I know for a fact I can never trust my brand new charger to tell me when it's done charging.And worse, despite being 100% charged the unit never switched over to trickle charge.  So despite being billed as a "smart" charger it's just a normal full power charger that will boil your battery dry if you leave it hooked up too long.  Why spend $45 on something that a $10 charger will do?Not only is it junk, the packaging is a complete lie as well.  Now I know and you can bet your sweet cajones I'll never buy a Schumacher anything again.I originally bought this item to power my laptop or any cellphones on long trips. i could have bought the 200w version or a cheaper power inverter, but i got the 400w as i always like to prepare for the unexpected, and it turns out i can watch a dvd on a nice TV in the trunk of my suv when i go BBQ.Pros:- the blue aluminum outer case provides a great heat dispersion medium, you can tell, touch it after its been running for 5-10 mins-it isnt too loud with the fan on- it HAS a fan- shuts off when car battery is too low- and the most important: provides alot of power for most application needs.Cons: -a bit bulky, however, i was able to stash it under the trunk storage- a little more expensive too but you get what you pay for.ALSO!!! becareful when using with your cig adpater, as it will probably burn your fuse. If you are hooking high amp appliances, connect directly to the battery._____update: Oct. 9, 2010After a while of using this, i still continue to like it more and more, it has yet to fail me, and provides energy to quite the array of power draining devices i have. You will NOT regret this, i come up with new ways to utilize this all the time, ever play mini portable air hockey on a camping trip?
Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersThis is a great product, love using this....but why the huge price increase?? almost doubled?I use this product on my side windows as well, works as good as Rainex. It really make water bead really good.I really recommend this product when it was going for $5.99....currently double?? I can get it cheaper at the local stores.My last 2 orders for this product either arrived damaged (leaked all over the place) or undeliverable because it was damaged. Still waiting more than a few months for Amazon.com to address this. 2007 2008 2009 2010 i spent more than $4000 buying stuff on Amazon.com  2011....have yet to spend a penny at Amazon.com. All cuz Amazon did not want to address a $12 purchase.
This is excellent for rear differentials, if you want Red Line for your transmission useRed Line 50304 Manual Transmission (MT) 90W Gear Oil - 1 QuartI had GL5 in my Toyota Pickup transmission, it worked OK, but the MT 90 allows for smoother shifting.Amazon has a better price with the free shipping than an online racing mail order place.  I ordered 6 of the MT90 and 4 of this gear oil, they were individually in plastic ziplock bags and all arrived in perfect condition.This is probably the 8th battery tender I have purchased for numerous applications, motorcycles, boat, ATV, etc.  Even a 6 volt model for a little Honda CT90.  Came securely packaged with all the expected adapters, etc.  Always had great luck with Battery Tender Junior's.Does a very good job at keeping the battery fully charged  Using the  included cigarette lighter connection works very well.  Quality made.Update 1-30-2010 Upgrade to 5 stars *****Had this unit in operation for over 18 MONTHS now and still working just fine.  I use it to keep the two (2) batteries in my 06 Chevy diesel truck charged.  The truck is only used to tow my RV so 10 months out of the past year the truck sits stored.  (My 08 Malibu gets 33 mpg truck 20mpg mpg hwy WHEN NOT TOWING)  The charger/maintainer has been constantly in use.Update: December 2010:  Unit in constant use for yet another year and still works fine.  10 stars!!!
Fram makes great air filters and this was another one that hit the mark.  My Toyota Sienna is happy with this purchase.Although it should be included for free with the Jack this item is a must have and reasonably priced.  Careful it's also easily stolen.I'm very happy with this product it works great with a Meguiars wax of your choice (preferably Ultimate Wax due to its forgiveness)
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom?Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection.I'm very happy with my purchase. After seeing a lot of negative reviews due to seal problems I hesitated to buy this. The reason I did buy it was because someone found a fix for the issue. Turns out the fix is not needed. I guess the manufacturer replaced the gasket because I have no problems whatsoever with air leaks. This device creates a perfect seal. Buy this! This is an awesome gauge with dead on accuracy. I highly recommend this to anyone in the market looking for a gauge. I mean come one it's only 10 bucks!
The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up.This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.It is just what it is supposed to be and I am satisfied. There is no way to tell if it will fall apart quickly or last forever so that is all I can say.
This stuff works. Had a flat in the middle of no where and this got me back on the trail. Works simply. You will need a valve core removal tool and a air compressor. I purchased a &#34;KIT&#34; that has everything you need. Purchased this bottle of &#34;Slime&#34; so incase I get another flat, I will have some. Just a heads up, this is meant at a temporary fix to get you to a repair place. Will last a while.This is the second one of these for us. We just bought a second horse trailer and this is so valuable I wanted one for each. Can't afford to forget it in the other trailer. I have read some other reviews and can't figure out how they can't get the wheel off the ground enough. You put this by the good wheel and drive it up onto the trailer-aid, the bad wheel is lifted off the ground without using a jack. When you are done, simply drive back off the ramp. Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road. Not to mention if you are alone what you do with them while you change the tire. If you own a tandem axel trailer this is an absolute MUST! If you have a tandem axel horse trailer, it may just save you or your horses life.This is a pretty simple, cheap compressor.  As others have said, you can take it out of the housing and turn it into a compact compressor that you can store easily.  Especially useful for motorcycles.  Don't try to use it on the battery without turning on the engine though.  You might end up draining your battery.I attach it to a gauge that has a passthrough valve and can check tire pressure and fill up easily before going out for a ride.  Since it's always best to do the tires before you start riding on them, this works out well for me.Accu Gage Air Check Inflate TiresIs the gauge I use
These look striking similar to the Bosch Clear advantage wipers, springy curved blade that hugs your windows. I did have a bit of trouble getting them on, for my car I had to take off the pre installed adapter on the Anco Contour wiper but after that it fits well and does a good job at clearing the window. Time will tell on their longevity.I have a 2005 Suzuki C50 Cruiser (700lbs 93") and this cover does cover the bike without its hard bags attached. It does have multi-bars on it, which to are covered.  The bottom half of both tires are exposed.  I am able to connect the front bungee, but the middle one has to attach to the bike frame, as it will not reach to the hole on the opposite side of the bike.It has been raining for the last couple of days, so I plan to go check it out in a few more days, as it is expected to rain through tomorrow.I will adjust my review if there was any issue with wind and/or upper portion of bike getting wet or dusty despite the cover being in place.For now, I do suggest picking this up, as the price-is-right.Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car!
These work great.Only need a small flat tip screw driver to pull back on the clips to remove the old ones and install the new ones.  Don't remove the clips completely, just pull them back a little bit and lift the hood gently at the same time.  2 people makes this a flash.My husband installed these on his 97 Cherokee in just 10 minutes.  Remove 2 bolts on top of each lift support and place a screwdriver under the spring clip on bottom and the ball joint connection on the lower end slips right on.Trunk now stays up and doesn't hit him in his head! Worth the time and money for sure.Be sure to support the trunk with a 2x4 or long broom handle before removing old lifts. Save the bolts because there are no bolts provided with the new lifts.This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price.
I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersI use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!
This tool requires the use of anti-sieze compound when chasing the threads.  Doing this gets the rust and crud out of the threads.  This is a must for proper seating and sealing of the O2 sensor.This product did a great job of balancing the temperatures throughout my home by correcting the direction of the air flow. The magnets are super strong and the materials super clear.This ice scraper is very well designed. It is sturdy enough to chisel through ice, and brush away large amounts of snow. A lot of ice scrapers have chisels and brushes at opposite ends of the handle, which makes using the chisel cumbersome (since you have to hold the device by the brush). However, the Hopkins Ice Hammer placed both the chisel and brush at the same end of the device. Overall, I am very satisfied.
these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the levelThe 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.
I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:"18 gauge wire""15 Amp Capacity"Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield.I wanted a 130-amp load tester because--at least per the manufacturers' claims--these units are more accurate than 100-amp models.  The OTC 3181 looks exactly like the Actron CP7614 (except for brand markings on the front), but is far less expensive.The OTC 3182 is a digital 130-amp load tester for just a bit more money than this OTC 3181, and it has a couple more features (an alternator test lead and a ripple detection light), but I tend to have better luck with analog products over digital products, in terms of reliability. Also, when you use the OTC 3182, it shows you just a number (the voltage reading), and you're on your own to interpret it. The OTC 3181, on the other hand, has "replace/weak/good" markings (in red/yellow/green), which make it very easy to interpret the results, without having to remember or think about what voltage range is acceptable during testing.I was a little surprised at the size of the unit when I opened the box.  It's a bit large!  The clamps are large and strong.  The overall feel is quality.When testing a battery (unless it's a totally dead battery), the unit will heat up very significantly.  Through the vent holes in the unit, you can actually see metal coils getting red hot, like little heater elements.  That's how the load is applied--in the form of heat.Testing is easy: With the vehicle and the key both off, attach the negative clamp to the negative post of the battery, then attach the positive clamp to the positive post of the battery.  (People with mechanical experience may think this is backwards, since you normally attach the positive clamp first.  I assure you, I am quoting the manufacturer here on the order advised.)  Press and hold the rocker switch for 10 seconds, and then quickly look at the needle while still holding the switch down.  (They advise against holding the rocker switch for more than 15 seconds.) To test the charging system, begin with the clamps attached as described above, then start the car and run it at 1,200 - 1,500 RPM, and read the needle.  Remove the positive clamp, and then the negative.When I was choosing a load tester, I kept reading about "zero adjust" features.  I didn't know what that meant.  Now that I have a unit in hand, I can see that it refers to a little screw in the face of the unit; turning this screw one way or the other (with the clamps not connected to anything!) allows you to adjust the needle so that it is accurately zeroed.  That's all.After reading the reviews and what each had to say about this disconnect switch, I purchased two. One for the engine battery and the other for the coach batteries in my RV.  The mounting bracket is "hefty". With the mounting hardware, it was a breeze installing these two switches. It is well worth the price just for the mounting bracket alone. Sturdy is the word I use for the switch. The only negative comment would be that I wish the key can be removed after engaging the switch. Yea, I know some would say it will keep you from forgetting the disconnect and take the key with you. I just prefer to have the ability to remove the key after the switch has been engaged.  Just me.
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.If you have a vehicle - like I do - that turns off the cigarette lighter circuit when you remove the key, then this meter is limited in its usefulness. Sure you can see what's cooking just by inserting the meter and turning on the ignition (without starting the car). But, suppose you want to continuously monitor the battery while it's being trickle charged over a few days and you have removed the keys. Can't do. Still, the unit is well-made, accurate (I checked it against a high quality VOM) and easy to read.
Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.Great for a 3" wide receiver for Tacoma or Tundra. It can be hard to find a hitchpin that is for a wider/reinforced receiver. This works well with some small room to spare. Highly recommend.This RTV is intended for primary use as engine gasket maker - temperature and oil resistant. But it also works well as general purpose RTV when the near-black (dark gray) color is desirable. Which was true for my application - making gaskets for mounting car speakers in odd sized door application that required custom spacers. Worked great.The dark color is especially troublesome to get off the hands - use disposable gloves during application.This package, a small &#34;squeeze&#34; tube is not easiest for application of a regular bead. It is easier to use the slightly larger, calk-gun sized package, so consider that if the larger quantity is also helpful.
work great for my John Deere X500Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.
arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly.This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?
The air filter from the dealer says Denso on it, so might as well get it with out the Toyota logo on it.  Has the markings for Up and Front, you would have to be a fool to mess up the install of this.Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks.We have tried this product several times and found "IT DOES NOT DISSOLVE" as advertised. (Camco 2 Ply RV & Marine Toilet Tissue)It plugs up against the gate valve so when you open it to dump, the "solids" and the tissue cannot come through.We have had our Black Tank Line snaked twice due to this product plugging up against the drain line gate valve. (and yes we use the appropriate chemicals)"Do Not" use this product in your RV. Try "Thetford" brand. Although only single ply, it will not plug up your sewer line and it dissolves as advertised.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models.I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderDesigned for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you did
Fits perfectly, will not slip and 3/4 the price in an RV accessory store (same Thing).  Cleans off in a JiffyPerfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems.Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.

Just slide the old one out and put this one in.
Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.Did some caliper work and these kept the car up even on a small grade with no issues at all.
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.These are a great set of handles.  They fit into existing bolt locations on the speaker bar in my 2011 2-door Wrangler, and are extremely sturdy.  They match the black interior perfectly, and the grip itself is a solid, strong rubber.  The mounting position is perfect for riders in the back seat. I bought these alongside theRugged Ridge 13505.04 Grab Handles, which I also recommend for the front seats.Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are.
People need to understand about motor oil to make the decision on what is right for them including if Royal Purple is what they should use or not.  Forget the marketing, and anything else that suggests this or any oil will do anything "spectacular".  What it can do is what a good motor oil can do, lubricate and help protect an engine from wear (when combined with a good filter). The synthetic oils benefits occur most when an engine is subjected to the extremes, high RPM, high stress, high/low temp situations where it will remain effective better than a conventional oil. Synthetic oils may also maintain their original properties a while longer than conventional oils.  That is it however. That is very important stuff, what motor oil is for. That is good enough, all that should be expected. But it is still motor oil. Any claims of this or any other oil making your car go faster or get better MPG or anything like that should not be believed. That is not the job of motor oil.The definition of "synthetic oil" in this Country is vague and most oils labeled "fully synthetic" are not made from 100% synthetic base stocks. To find out more about how this works look up Mobil Vs Castrol, this was the lawsuit in this country that allowed oils that originated from dino oil to legally be called "fully synthetic".  This does not mean they are bad oils, just that the use of the work synthetic can be misleading.One would need to look to see what base stocks are used to see just how fully synthetic an oil truly is. The base stocks in motor oil are Group I,II,III,IV and V base stocks. Group I-III (1-3) are all conventional mineral oils that have come from the ground. Dino oil. Only Group IV and V use synthetic base stocks (P.A.O. for group IV) and (Esters for group V).95% of oils labeled "fully synthetic" actually begin with group III base stocks which are then highly processed in to the final product.This does not mean that an oil is bad because it is not a true "fully synthetic" oil using 100% group IV or V base stocks or better just because it does use them, but this is something I think is misleading and not understood by most. Though being a true group IV oil using those P.A.O. base stocks is considered better by many. It is an indication of a high quality oil, and certainly meets the definition of a true fully synthetic oil, just not the only consideration.There is much more to an oil than just the base stocks used. The formulations are very complex including many additives with detergent and anti-wear properties along with several others. Many factors go in to making a top quality motor oil.I would not suggest one think they can go incredibly long times between oil changes just because they are using a high quality oil or because a certain mileage figure is on the label. When used with a good filter one may be able to go longer between changes with a good oil, but to protect your engine better you also need to keep clean and fresh enough oil of any type in it. This oil is no exception. Your oil may be capable of outlasting your filter. Some find that changing filters more often than their oil helps extend change intervals. Also there is more to consider when determining oil change intervals than just mileage. Engine type (does it have a turbo for example), environmental extremes etc. also need to be considered. And time is a consideration too because while the oil itself may not be "worn out" or the additive package in it may still be effective (particularly in Extended Performance versions which contain larger amounts) still there are contaminants that oil filters do not remove which are a result of the combustion process, over time these build up and can only be removed by changing your oil. This is also why if you use a vehicle seasonally such as storing your motorcycle over the winter it is best to change the oil when you put it away rather than at the start of the season.If you look on the bottles of oils with claims they can go for long periods of time between oil changes (15K plus) you will find some small print saying things such as "Do not alter oil change intervals from manufacturer requirements on vehicles under warranty (as this will likely VOID your warranty not keeping the maintenance schedule)" and "25,000 miles OR ONE YEAR" as well as many other various conditional statements about the vehicle operating conditions. What may be OK under ideal and perfect conditions is different from most all real situations.Some people engage in oil testing, sending their oil to labs to find out condition of the oil.  For me this seems perhaps reasonable if one it attempting to find out what length change interval they are able to obtain with a certain oil/filter combination.  However as something done on a regular basis for the average consumer this costs as much as an oil change so I would just change the oil instead of finding out the condition the old oil is in.As to Royal Purple being a good synthetic oil? I would say yes it is. Also very expensive particularly with this deal. If it is either the best or worth the price is the larger questions to consider. Is it worth it at this price? I would say NO it was recently on sale for 6.99/quart, at that time or the next time it goes on sale that is the prime time to purchase. Personally I prefer other brands, though my decisions are changing along with the changing of formulations of the oils I use. One should do research in to various synthetic motor oils and consider those as well and decide which one to use. Do not go by marketing claims. There are independent tests and discussions, there is even one with over 1000 posts on this subject on Amazon right now. Many other outside oil forums as well. One can also have their oil tested to compare results vs other brands used at various intervals in their own vehicle if one wants to do that sort of personal research which will yield at least some results.  Also formulations are constantly changing so what ingredients used in any particular oil one year may not be what the formulation is today or will be tomorrow. If you research oil and decide that it is worth paying a bit more for a true group IV oil, then that is a reasonable decision to pay a bit more for that oil. I believe this RP is among Group IV oils, meaning it uses 100% synthetic base stocks.  But contact Royal Purple to confirm this because their formulations change like all others. Make sure you know what you are buying.I would also encourage purchasing any oil when it is on a big sale or has a rebate etc.. I believe most synthetics are overpriced and should be purchased only when on sale as this does happen on a regular basis. Check Amazon and other auto supply stores. There are constantly sales on synthetic oils and/or rebates making the cost per quart 6.00 or less on a regular basis, this is the time to purchase your oil.  Often there are packages with filters which can be good deals as long as the filter is the one you would like to use also.  This nor any other oil will perform well without also using a high quality filter, period. Make sure you are also using a high quality filter. The two need to both be of good quality for best performance and protection.I give this a 4 star rating due to price. It has been on sale for less recently and that is the time to purchase expensive oils. Plan ahead and buy your oil when on a really good sale. You can save about 50% or at least close to it often times especially when offered with packages including an oil filter (as long as it is a good filter). The star rating reflects the value of this deal at this price.In the end get a high quality oil but remember no oil is going to be providing its full benefits if it is no longer effective due to excessive use or age.  Keep your maintenance schedules up to get the best performance and longest life out of your vehicle.Royal Purple IS one in the group of top quality motor oils, just where it ranks is much more difficult to determine.  Disregard outrageous claims made by any manufacturer or person and do your own research in to various synthetic oils to make a decision on which to use.  There are several very good quality brands. Also learn about API, ILSAC and Dexos1 specifications mean. This Royal Purple DOES meet the most current API specification (SF) the ILSAC GF-5 and GM's new Dexos1 requirements. It should be compared against other synthetics that also meet those same specifications. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT RATINGS. These are your best street car motor oils. So YES this is a good oil, NO it will not do anything other high quality synthetic oils in the same class can do, and No this is not the best price I have seen for this oil.Instead of comparing claims on a bottle (other than those API, ILSAC and perhaps Dexos1 ratings) do some outside research. Ignore outrageous claims and make an informed decision based upon knowledge of the oil and filters you purchase and what an appropriate price to purchase them at is.EDIT: Note that at the time of the review Royal Purple was using PAO base stocks.  I have information that it is not not a 100% PAO oil. This has been a pattern among oils that were once 100% PAO group IV oils so you can not count on any brand maintaining their formulations or advising or a new formulation or change.  There are some advantages to a PAO oil such as no need for V.I. additives and if you believe in the value of P.A.O. base stock oils that could justify a slightly higher purchase price.  My belief in this change is a response to this question by a representative or Royal Purple.  This does not mean it is no longer a good oil to buy just that the formulation may no longer use P.A.O. base stocks.  One should know what they are paying for particularly if they are purchasing a product at a premium price especially if that product no longer uses the ingredients one things it does.while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.To be honest, there are tons of these gap gauges around, made by all sorts of different companies. I dont actually think that this gap gauge is any better than the others, but it does its job, so it deserves 5 stars. On top of that, im dealing with iridium plugs, so you would need a gap gauge like this to do the job right. (the coin gap gauge will damage your precious metal!!!)Great stuff overall!
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE!I drilled a couple of holes into my toolbox and mounted this to the side of the toolbox.  now my grease gun is always handy and does not take up space in the toolbox.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander

connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect.This product works extremely well and is extremely reliable. Anyone complaining about the short cord didn't do their homework. The pictures clearly illustrate a short cord. A 12 foot cord would be ridiculous on a car mountable charger. I like to use those 9 inch lighted extension cords sold atwalmart and Amazon.com, These give you a lighted indication of power when plugged in. My charger is under hood mounted and has seen over 110 degreeswhile running highway speeds and charging in summer heat. Frankly I'm amazed it still works 5 years later. I will buy another if it quits working.I only like to use AC Delco products on my truck.This filter is good for about 30,000 miles of service.I've used AC Delco PCV valves,brake pads,rotors,brake hoses,shoes,drums and spark plugs.I've never had an issue with AC Delco products.I worked as a auto mechanic for over fifty years.I highly recommed this filter and all AC Delco products.
No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal.Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.
you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech.You can't go wrong with these and should place them on all vehicle battery terminals after cleaning them. They are very easy to apply; red on positive, green on negative, between the battery and the terminal, on the post. Do this quickly as the car computer may require reprogramming if you do it too slow; if that happens it is easy to reprogram, just read your owners manual (it can alter window and door lock function). Before you start blow across the vents to dissipate and vapors that could explode with sparking, wear protective glasses and protective clothes (long sleeves) and wash your hands after.  The liquid in the cells is very acidic and will eat through clothes and skin. This is a good time to add distilled water to the vent holes. Do not top them off but bring the level to the bottom of the venting ring; leave space to vent the gases, there is a slot. Close the cell caps. Use a wire brush on dirty or corroded or fuzzy (usually a white or green powder) terminals and connectors.  Check your electrolyte, if you know how, to see if your battery is weak or has low/bad cells. If you have a lot of corrosion, cap the vents and mix about a tsp. of baking soda in a glass of water and brush it on with a toothbrush (if you get any in a cell it will kill the battery), it will foam up if there is acid, then rinse and dry before placing the washers and terminals. Remove the ground first, place the felt washer, replace the terminal, then place the positive. Reset your clock and anything with memory (GPS). Prepare for winter. If your battery is past the expiration date, replace it so you don't get stuck somewhere. Most good batteries do not live past their expiration date and can't be relied upon. Walmart and Costco batteries seem to be the most reliable according to reviews.The unique locking pin makes these worthwhile. However, when you read the instructions, it's not clear how to bend the "tab" to hold the supports in the frame. Best way is to take a big screwdriver and bend them inward. Can't believe they don't put that on the instructions, since it's not intuitive.
Invisible glass is an awesome glass cleaner!! We first bought it for cleaning the windows on our cars but have since began to use it for any glass. We use it to clean our mirrors, glass coffee tables, interior windows and more. It truly does make the glass INVISIBLE. This works really well for cleaning the windows on your car between washes or right after washing to make sure that the windows are streak free.We highly recommend Invisible Glass and will be buying more soon.I love it. Can also use to leave vehicle outside so the BatteryMinder ( Tender ) stays dry in the garage, if it rains outside. A must have for me. I want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf, not under the hood in a hot engine bay.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.
I have always been a fan of handwashing my vehicles but over the years I have sometimes come across the problem of leaving small scratches or swirl marks on the surface due to dirt/grit staying on my wash mitt/sponge. After purchasing two grit guards for the 2 bucket wash method, I couldn't be happier!By simply running your wash materials over the guard, it loosens up the dirt and debris removed from your car, sending it right to the bottom of the bucket. This allows you to get a clean mitt every time and it keeps the dirt from landing back on your car.If you are a fan of washing your car and keeping it looking new like I am, I would suggest picking up a grit guard or two. Your car's finish will thank you for it!Use these in trailer tires, car tires, truck tires, ANY tires-these have saved me several times on the road, pull the nail, install one or 2 of these, reinflate with a small portable (or my nitrogen tank if I'm in the service truck), back on the road.Love bugs in Florida, along with the other flying critters around are a real test for a product like this. Heck, you can saddle up and ride some of the insects that hit the windshield and front paint on your car, motorcycle, and motorhome!  Use this product and they all wash of with vertually no effort.  Works on the windshield glass without effecting wipers.  Cycle windshields become rain dispersing and clear as can be. Te front of my Camper looks like new.Use is after your clean the vehicle completely, do not use wax over it, and enjoy the results!  Oh, don't sit on your car hood after using this product, YOU WILL SLIDE RIGHT OFF!!!!
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...Does exactly what it's supposed to do,fit low and snug on the filter cover. To work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment.Recommended for sure!Great Item works on most trailers and best part it is rekeyable if you know how! Fits on 2" and 1 & 7/8 would only use this along with a tounge lock and some sort of wheel lock as well
Does everything. I can see when the tanks flush out clean. Has a valve so you can easily flush a tank and do it again if it needs more. Flush out the sewer hose when you are done. Should be standard item on a new RV.I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.
My truck was in need of a new fuel filter and all the parts stores around wanted nearly 3 times the price of what Amazon wanted.Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara. Simple install. Does what it is suppose to do.Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car
good strong brass bristles, well made, how many words do i need to say it's a good tool!...oh, 1 more lolThis is the only oil I've used in my Harley's for many many years.  It does what it's designed to do and it does it very well.  Great stuff.Very strong and ergonomically pleasing product! I have already used this numerous times this winter and it's excellent. The brush is high quality and the scraper work great. I bet this brush lasts many, many winters.
Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.Forget windex, this stuff is much better, no streaking and like the name says it really does make the glass invisible!
This stuff is not too stinky so you don't have to use it outside. It bonds very well to anything I have tried it with and sets up quickly, but not too quickly. One thing I used it for was cementing the dryer exhaust vent to the house. Just be sure to mix it up with something disposable -- I use a paper plate and a popsicle stick. It will dry to a gray color, so don't use it on something that needs to be clear.I got this to aid in preventing uneven sanding to my truck bumpers while prepping the surface to accept paint. The block is rigid but soft and it easily accepts sand paper being wrapped around it. I was able to get a wider sanding path and keep it nice and even for a very nice scuffed surface for painting without getting an uneven paint job. I highly recommend this product.If it moves and it shouldn't, Loctite.  I like to use this for small items that I will need to take apart in the future, but I do not want to have loosen up during use.  Like tiny screws in a gun or something else small and hard to replace.
a little disappointed. Did not work as well as the Chrome wheel cleaner.I used this roller to install dynamat extreme in a new car. Has a nice handle that is used almost as much as the roller itself to smooth out the sound deadening material..I did not receive what is shown in the picture.  It does not have the two round lids that turn on top, but rather a hinged lid held by two thumb screws.  Doesn't really matter, as it works just the same.  This is a nice cover, and I'm happy with it.  It looks better than the one it replaced.
This is one of the items I have to replace every 3 months where I live, so these cabin filters can get expensive. I was using OEM Toyota cabin filters but the price was too high. I switched over to WIX and the first thing I noticed was the quality of the WIX is BETTER than the OEM Toyota filter. The reinforced black sides are thicker and the filter media is thicker. Not to mention, the price is right in line for my budget! Buy one, or two, or three!CPSI have a 2012 BWM f650gs 800cc twin motorcycle.  These Rotax engines make a very annoying fuel injector tick - TICK,TICK,TICK ... sounds like something is horribly wrong.  But, it is normal.  So, I have found that adding a tablespoon of ashless, smokeless 2-stroke oil each tankful, along with about a cup of Techron - that annoying tick is almost gone.  I run this bike hard and it runs great with this formula.  I also use ASL CamGuard in the oil (5% mixture - also on Amazon).I bought some really bad fuse holders that had some horrible fuses included. I had to replace the fuses with the ones from this ATD. These fuses are great quality and they include all the common fuse sizes which is great. This is a sweet buy when you consider your local auto parts store asks $3-$5 for just a pack of 3 fuses in one size. You get alot of fuses in the most common amperage's. Please note these are just one size fuse, There is still one size larger blade fuse and two smaller sizes. Check what you have before ordering. Personally I got them for my fuse-able links I'm adding for all the accessories I have added to my vehicle. When you do any accessory installs in your vehicle I recommend fusing at the point you tapped power from. Better safe than sorry.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.i used on rear brake shoe replacement.  It goes on easily without fuss or mess.  Hopefully it performs as expected.I used this to wrap the ehaust system on my 2004 Yamaha R6. Went on good and looks good against the black frame. Also keeps the heat down from buring the track plastics!
Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.The door protector is the perfect size. thick enough to protect the door even if you open too hard. Other protectors are thinner. Easy to mount. You will need to provide your own screws.Great fit and very easy to install. Certainly will help avoid paint damage on the rocker.  Would recommend to anyone.
Whether you are looking to patch up a hole, or even recreate an entire metal part without casting, JB Weld does it. I use this stuff for computers when I am modding and want a permanent bond. Just equal parts of each tube and a whole world of possibilities opens up!!You know those expensive "headlight restoration" kits you can get?  Well, you can actually use an abrasive polish (like this one) and achieve much the same result.  I use masking tape around the edges of my headlights, then use an orbital polisher with a firm pad to polish my headlights using this compound.  It's very adept at removing that thin layer of yellowish oxidation which makes headlights more opaque than clear.  Best of all, this bottle has a lot of compound in it and you could polish your headlights probably 75 times on one bottle before running out.So there is that... but it's also good on paint.Over the years I have found the best use of a rubbing compound is to either restore heavily oxidized finishes (with no clearcoat), or to remove paint/scuff deposits on a small area of your car.Be advised that this is a very abrasive compound and you should NOT use this as a general purpose polish for a newer car finish.  Every time you use this product you remove a tiny layer from your car's finish.  Remember that and use with caution.  If someone bumps into your new car in the parking lot and left a paint scuff, this is the ideal product to get it off with.  If you have an old car that's been sitting out in the sun too long and has faded a bit, you can use this product on the entire car to bring it back to its near-original shine by removing that layer of oxidation which makes it look dull.So whether you own a new car or old one, this is a great product to keep in the garage for detailing days.I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products.
It's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.
If you have a high lift jack this is a must have.  You know you will need this in the worst of situations and this will provide better floatation in soft soil and sand.Most manufacturers use a variation of lubricant similar to ATF to insure smooth shifting, even when the transmission is cold. They also rarely specify a change interval.  If you want the best lubricant for your manual transmission, MTL is it.  It requires a slow hand on frigid days, but will insure the transmission will last the life of the vehicle.Whether you are looking to patch up a hole, or even recreate an entire metal part without casting, JB Weld does it. I use this stuff for computers when I am modding and want a permanent bond. Just equal parts of each tube and a whole world of possibilities opens up!!
First thing's First -- DON'T USE THE BRUSH THEY GIVE YOU! It starts shedding and the hairs will get all over your calipers. Having used this before, I knew that ahead of time and was sure to use a standard painter's brush (thin and medium size).I went Black for my calipers so as to just clean them up. 2012 VW Jetta. I did light coats to start and then got the point I was just smearing the enamel on like icing to be sure I got full effect of what I wanted the results to be. It also helps to bake them with hair dryers after each coating to ensure it dries and adheres better.Always lay a trash bag and news paper below each target caliper otherwise the enamel will adhere to your garage floor or driveway. If it gets on your hands, just run them under hot water with Dawn and the enamel will turn into flakes and just come right off. The caliper cleaner may or may not be enough depending on the age of your car and how worn your calipers are, so be sure to buy another can if you feel you will need it.I stuck one the tongue of the rv and its off, when i compare it to my larger one.  I would not advise to stick it to the trailer.  Very difficult to pull off.I saw mixed reviews and bought anyway.  I should have just both two of them right off the bat.  Bought the one, put it on, and it looks fine.  If I run into problems with the springs, I think there are lots of things I can do to bind it to the step.  Fits my RV step just fine.  Now I will order the second one.  If the springs hold up, that will be great because it is good to be able to take it off easily to wash the rug.
This is basically the same as regular sta-bil but with twice the potency...definitely a better buy than the red stuff.This item appears to be the same as what you'd get from the dealer, only at a fraction of the price.  personally, i like the baking soda odor neutralizing ones better, but this is good also.I ordered this before I was aware of Pri-G. I understand Sea Foam is much better than Sta-bil but not as good as Pri-G. Pri-g is MUCH more concentrated and therefore represents a better value. It is what I will be ordering in the future.
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.The reason I am giving the lock three stars is the lock would not work for our trailer hitch. we have a Lance trailer and the hitch was to wide for the lock to fit over. I may grind down the sides of our hitch so I may use it, I will check with Lance first so not to weeken the hitch if for and reason it may then the reese lock is unuseable for my lance trailer and I will pass the lock on to someone who can use it.2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL
This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for?Very sturdy, bright color, well made. This is what you need in a chock although I cannot find a weight rating.This is a great product.  You can see exactly what goes thru it and will know when the tanks are clean.
Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RVa regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.perfect size and fit for changing automatic transmission fluid on an impreza holds about a quart and a half while it drips in
Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though.a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.Well, it's a spark plug socket, right? So, either it works or it don't, right?  Well, this one works OK.  Just have to be careful in that in trying to remove the plugs, it might have a tendency to slip off of your socket wrench.  Other than that, it seems to be pretty good quality and works fine.
I didn't read the product description before I bought this applicator, I just assumed it was a pad, Wrong!! it a glove type  thing that looks like a mit you would use to wash your car. I actually haven't used it yet but give it a try soon and see if I like it over using a pad.This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.Had a gimmick NFL thing for the window in my car. Had to plug it in to the car 12v to use it. Dogs wanted to play with the cord. Ran across this on Amazon and bought it. Surprisingly enough the dogs don't play with this! This works very well for what I bought it for. I do recommend this!
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.Ordered this so we could do oil change jobs on our 2010 equinox.  Yes it works for the 2.4 as well as the 2.2 that its advertised for.  Does the job as intended.  Don't like the way chevy set up their filters but oh well what can you do.I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders.
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.
If you work on dirty/greasy stuff, you need this.Gritty, to get the grunge out of your fingerprints/creases, doesn't smell odd, and it dissolves grease like you would not believe.  One cleaning, and you're likely done, even if your hands could double as pumpkin lube. (automotive reference)Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.Do what as it says and you'll get the results you wanted. don't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint. otherwise, this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxing
This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
Works great for smaller seals but it couldn't pull out the rear main seal for a 2002-2006 MINI Cooper. These are very large seals. The tool just couldn't provide enough leverage for that. I used a flat blade screwdriver instead. Perfect tool for small and medium size seals.Maybe on bus-sized class A motorhomes with larger refrigerators this is useful, but it is not any good for my RV refrigerator (26 ft vehicle, decent sized refrigerator).  I don't use this, as it is too large, and use the single bars instead.  They work well.Great for a 3" wide receiver for Tacoma or Tundra. It can be hard to find a hitchpin that is for a wider/reinforced receiver. This works well with some small room to spare. Highly recommend.
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletThis is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommend
If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.I love K&N filters.  I use them in all my cars. As soon as I buy a car I replace the filter with a K&N. Just buy a cleaner kit and clean as needed. Never will need replacing. Do not over oil the filter once you clean it and let it dry before reinstalling filter. If you over oil the filter, the oil can get into intake manifold and build up dirt.I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump.
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellThis product meet all that I need it to do, this item I has a tough and rough skin. If you need to use this item for semi-full time mounted in order to charge a battery that does not always get used, this would be the right choose.
I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect.i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely
It's simple and effective.  You easily get an accurate rating on your spark plug gap, and you can use the hole to pry the electrode open if need be.  Very convenient tool to have if you're a Do-It-Yourselfer.If you ride around the roads of south Florida then you need this product in your tires. You will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! It worksNeeded for the 2010 Toyota Sienna.  I tried some others and they don't allow you to take off the canister.  This is necessary if you want to change your own oil.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.Do yourself a HUGE favor and use a mass flow (MAF) senor cleaner to clean the MAF sensor.  DON'T use carburetor, fuel injector or throttle body cleaner or you'll ruin the MAF sensor.
Does a great job cleaning grime that collects on KN filters for my truck and twin intakes on G37s. Less than 10 minutes of soaking and it removes the old oil and dirt. Rinse with water and blow dry with a hair dryer or even a leaf blower and your ready to reapply new oil that allows the flow through fabric to filter out fast flowing intake.These arrive as MOPAR original with alcohol pads to clean the area before you install with the double sided sticky tape.  Install takes just a few minutes.  Great product and 100% satisfied.Cheap and quick fix for those of you with aging pullstraps.  Ours were literally falling apart.  Sliding out the old and in with the new  took seconds.
this is perfect for my truck the one that came with truck is very small and is difficult to remove lug nuts. with this its a breeze.like other reviews say the bag to hold the items that comes with this is very cheap and is probably not going to last to long but its not a deal breaker for me i don't need the bag.I'd stripped out the threads on my travel trailer's battery.  I needed something to left my disconnect the power without disconnecting the cables.  The "Little Switch" did the trick.  First I'd like to say that not all of these types of switches come with a mounting bracket.  This one does which seems like a no brainer, but in the era of "not enough dollars = not enough sense" in manufacturing you have to be careful.  I'm pleased that it is also a weather resistent swicth which is also not always the case, even amount marine swicthes.  The weather cap slides over the key hole when the key is out.  There is also a water / dust cover the fits on the key for use when the key is "in", however that's a little tricky to get on.  All mounting and wiring nuts and hardware has been included.  So far, it's doing it's job, battery is holding it's voltage just as if it was disconnected.This appears to be a very nice kit! I gave it 4 starts because I have not used it yet and would have been nice if the manufacturer included a tube of rubber cement to aide in and sealing any tire plugs. Also I see velcro material on the exterior of the kit case, but no velcro was included in the kit to apply to the interior of the vehicle or storage area.What I do like about this kit is that there is an adapter to run the compressor off the battery directly as some of these new car 12V sources can not handle the amperage load.I will report back after it`s first use, whenever that may be... otherwise it looks like a very good kit.
Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.I bought this for my 2012 Forest River R-Pod 177 stock tongue jack.  It fits on the post just fine with no modifications to either the jack post or the foot plate required.  I agree with some of the other posts that suggest that a weep hole be drill into the plate to allow fluid to drain.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.

This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch.I'm obliged to switch regularly between 1-7/8" and 2" balls on my hitch, and the Reese Interlock hitch balls make the swap a one-handed operation with the Reese Towpower hitch. That may not seem significant, but in inclement weather it allows you to hold an umbrella or tarp for protection and complete the swap with your remaining hand, in comparative comfort; the first time you have to change a ball in the rain, sleet or snow will sell you on one-handed swaps.This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.
Extension cable for inverter. Can set up inverter a good ways away from car if I need to. Just handy to have.Best Full Synthetic motor oil you can buy next to AMSOIL or Redline.  If you want to do your own research, visit [...] and you can learn a lot.I also use mine to power my NorthStar 16 gal. yard spayer. I can spray two tanks full before the JNC runs down.

Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.This is a great replacement bolt kit for your License plate mounts.  I personally did not need the grommets but the bolts were exactly what i needed.  Only negative is that the key for the bolts should have been grooved on both ends, as the groove is only on the tip of the long end leaving you to struggle with the short end of the key when the bolt gets really tight.  Advise using something like a Ratchet extender on it....I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose, so I returned it and got this.  A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge "back in the day" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a "dual chuck" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.
i have a 2007 toyota yaris,, installed in less than 3 min behind the glove box.,. a lot less price than going to the dealer...Cheaper than the "cheapies" I could get locally.  My local Walmart doesn't carry anything smaller than 15 inch so.....  Gotta love these finds.  $7.50 a blade from Amazon.In the desert the heat / Sun kills the rubber on the blades and it almost never rains.  So I always buy the cheapest blades given that I will be replacing them sooner rather than later and they need not remove snow or ice.  They just dry rot here.  BUT, I cannot find a cheap brand smaller than 15 inches locally.  So I order here and while I am paying about $1.50 more than local cheap blades, I have no choice and I get a better brand.  Oh and I don't mess with the blade refills anymore.  It just isn't worth the hassle unless you just can't afford it.Installed this in my 95 Civic Hatchback.  It is brighter than any bulbs I have ever put in the civic and I have own the car many years.  All the Civic forums suggested that this is the brightest bulb you can get for you EG civic (other than HID).  Supposedly, it only has a 200 hour life.  Even if I average an hour per day, that is still at least 6 months.  I'm okay with that.
this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter. this is an oil filter for cars.  it filters things. this is a filter.I tried several portable inflators during the past 5 yrs ; this one is tops as it holds a charge and comes with accessories;the old one croaked after 5 years so the product description said this was a direct replacement for the model we had.  It's close, the mounting hole is &#34;off&#34; about 1/8&#34; so be prepared to deal with this discrepancy.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.its like im driving in a club especially when the beat setting is pressed (i think it reacts better when you have your cars engine off so only the base makes it move) i like having all the colors turn on while im driving especially at night, it doesnt distract me at all and makes me enjoy driving my car around.i paid 100 bucks for someone to install this for me, and honestly i watched him do it its not easy, and you shouldnt do it unless you know how to install things in your carPermatex is the stuff my automotive junkies.  It will allow you to undo what you have done.  You do know that spark plugs come back out don't you?  Make sure the application is correct.  Some metal combinations will prefer nickel over copper based and so on. but for general use, this is the goop for you.
I have a tandem-axel trailer, and the suspension is such that when one tire is on this Leveler, the trailer is NOT lifted high enough to get the 2nd tire off the ground too.  This has the effect of putting unevenly distributed weight on the axels AND limiting the leveling effect.If you have a single axel, this will work GREAT.  I'm still giving this 5-starts based on it's solid construction and how easy it is to back up onto a stepped ramp.  But, if you have tandem axels AND their suspension is like mine...you'll need to pass on this one.  I gave mine to a friend with a single-axel tent-trailer, and he loves it.I keep my PUP in the garage - this dock assures my camper does not come rolling out of the garage.  Between this and some 2x4 on the tires, my PUP is not going anywhere.While camping, this dock helps out a great deal when the soil is soft or sandy; it helps distribute the hitch dolly wheel load more evenly.Nice low profile, does contour well to the windshield.  The next step up from this is almost double the cost.
i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicelyI use this power adapter to test equipment (small tire air compressor, USB Power Adapters) along with charging batteries in my home. This Power Adapter is made of good quality and has lasted over 2 years without any problems. Well worth buying.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!
i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicelyIt does what it's intended to do - charge or maintain a battery.  I bought two of these to use on a boat battery and RV battery during winter storage.  First one is 4 years old and second one was purchased last month.  Both are going strong.  The only drawback is they do make a very distinct high-pitch humming noise while charging.  I keep them in the basement though so they are not heard.  If they're going to be used within constant earshot, may want to reconsider.I have two battery tenders plus a solar battery tender panel. All are quality items, and do their jobs well.
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back.This is a piece of junk.! The straps stretch, the plastic clips slip off while tightening, and the dam things fall off while driving. Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on.  They do work well.The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck.
I have had no problems with the functional use of this connector.  I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.  If you can't find Safari Charlie, I'd recommend trying an electrical contact cleaner or conductive contact grease like what is used on trailer harness connectors.  Any auto parts store should have those.This is a fantastic cleaner for all kinds of dirt. I used it on the painted sheetrock wall where the kids run their hands along it while going down the stairs. You know the kind of dirt that is? It got all that off and did not ruin the finish of the paint. Another example is the grease stain on our synthetic porch floorboards came right off and did not damage that material either.The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing.
This is a great product for auto detailing. I have personally used this product as a quick detailer, clay lube, and no-rinse wash. This is as simple as diluting the product to the proper ratio.Use this post from the ONR website to learn about the proper dilution ratios: [...]I've been away from this product for a few years. Iw as trying a wide variety of different polishes. This is still the best. Nothing else is close.This stuff is amazing this is my third bottle of this product and I have to say it is the best quick detailer, in between washes this product brings the mirror like shine right back to where it should be.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Used after clay bar treatment on brand new car. Wiped on easily, then wiped off easily with little effort. Used on a white car, so tricky to see where I had applied it and removed it (had to depend on reflections). Be sure to dampen the applicator first--MUCH easier. Used a Meguiar's microfiber applicator pad.The door catches on a toy hauler will wear out over time, whether from sun damage or excessive use, etc. These are a great thing to have on hand for the times this happens. Easy, two screw install...should fit directly over the existing door catch holes on most RV's.
If you need to fill in light scratches or pinholes in filler then this will work great. Dries quickly (if not too thick) and sands easily once dry. If you try to sand it before it is dry, it is going to clog up your sandpaper but once dry it sands well. Easy to use and minimal shrinkage.Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc.First thing's First -- DON'T USE THE BRUSH THEY GIVE YOU! It starts shedding and the hairs will get all over your calipers. Having used this before, I knew that ahead of time and was sure to use a standard painter's brush (thin and medium size).I went Black for my calipers so as to just clean them up. 2012 VW Jetta. I did light coats to start and then got the point I was just smearing the enamel on like icing to be sure I got full effect of what I wanted the results to be. It also helps to bake them with hair dryers after each coating to ensure it dries and adheres better.Always lay a trash bag and news paper below each target caliper otherwise the enamel will adhere to your garage floor or driveway. If it gets on your hands, just run them under hot water with Dawn and the enamel will turn into flakes and just come right off. The caliper cleaner may or may not be enough depending on the age of your car and how worn your calipers are, so be sure to buy another can if you feel you will need it.
I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work.First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product.This polish really does a beautiful job on virtually any metal.I would guess I've been using this polish for over 30 yearsand have found there's pretty much no end to what this polish is good for.It gives a gleaming shine on:Brass ~ silver ~ copper ~ gold ~ chrome ~ aluminum ~ pewter ~ stainless steel ~ and more.It's not good on many painted nor plated surfaces as it may remove paint & plating.I can say from experience that it ruins/removes the gold or silver flashing on china.I use this on so many things that I keep tubes of simichrome in the house & garage for convenience.Plus carry it in both the car & truck as it's proven to be very use-full when antiquing.Especially for checking if an item is Bakelite.The pink polish will turn a yellowish (dark yellow to a canary) if it's Bakelite ~no matter what color of Bakelite your testing.The polish will stay pink if it's not Bakelite.While cleaning our un-hearted garage this past fall I found a particle tube behind a cabinetthat must have been there for over 20 years ~ and it was still fresh & worked like new!Freezing doesn't damage it, I leave it in the garage & autos years around.This polish leaves a protective finish so metals don't darken again as quickly ~while adding a beautiful shine.
Do yourself a HUGE favor and use a mass flow (MAF) senor cleaner to clean the MAF sensor.  DON'T use carburetor, fuel injector or throttle body cleaner or you'll ruin the MAF sensor.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.Bought for an APO address and free shipping, couldn't beat it. When you twist off the bottle cap the remaining ring easily falls off, so be careful if you pour directly into your oil reservoir, don't want the plastic ring falling in with the oil. But use a funnel and you won't have the problem. Will buy again.
There are two (2) 50 gram bars in the package but there is enough clays on each bar that I cut them in halves & used the halves without any problem.Water hardness makes a noticeable difference. If you have hard ground water like I do, my advice is to spend the few extra bucks to wash & clay your car in a self car wash where the water is softened or deionized.Other wise you will not reap the full benefit of claying a car as you are just grinding the paint with microscopic mineral deposits.Use water as lubricant, do not leave any soap on the paint & use the suds as lubricant as the chemical in soap will quickly break down the clay bar itself. You will find the clay "disintergrate" after 1-2 car washes if you rely on soap as lubricant.You can't go wrong with these and should place them on all vehicle battery terminals after cleaning them. They are very easy to apply; red on positive, green on negative, between the battery and the terminal, on the post. Do this quickly as the car computer may require reprogramming if you do it too slow; if that happens it is easy to reprogram, just read your owners manual (it can alter window and door lock function). Before you start blow across the vents to dissipate and vapors that could explode with sparking, wear protective glasses and protective clothes (long sleeves) and wash your hands after.  The liquid in the cells is very acidic and will eat through clothes and skin. This is a good time to add distilled water to the vent holes. Do not top them off but bring the level to the bottom of the venting ring; leave space to vent the gases, there is a slot. Close the cell caps. Use a wire brush on dirty or corroded or fuzzy (usually a white or green powder) terminals and connectors.  Check your electrolyte, if you know how, to see if your battery is weak or has low/bad cells. If you have a lot of corrosion, cap the vents and mix about a tsp. of baking soda in a glass of water and brush it on with a toothbrush (if you get any in a cell it will kill the battery), it will foam up if there is acid, then rinse and dry before placing the washers and terminals. Remove the ground first, place the felt washer, replace the terminal, then place the positive. Reset your clock and anything with memory (GPS). Prepare for winter. If your battery is past the expiration date, replace it so you don't get stuck somewhere. Most good batteries do not live past their expiration date and can't be relied upon. Walmart and Costco batteries seem to be the most reliable according to reviews.K&N; have apparently moved their production to Mexico. Older filters of this same type have been made in the U.S.A. I don't immediately notice any quality difference, and the "Mexican" types are sealed in cellophane inside the cardboard box.  This is good, because in a humid environment, if you stock up the shelf of the garage like I do, small traces of surface rust can form on unprotected threads.  I have one of the U.S.A. ones left, and I'll open this one up to more fully compare gaskets, construction, and measurements between the two. Will update.Note: Avoid the "PS" series of K&N.; Inferior quality, not worth the slight price difference.----UPDATE----The center threaded disc that spins onto the post of your vehicle's filter mount has some glue or sealant in the transition between the disc and the rest of the filter's base. I cleaned it off, but am a little disappointed, since the stuff could have come off on its own and circulated through the engine. Maybe it would eventually be caught by the filter, or maybe the particles would just lodge somewhere in the engine.  Not good.  Never saw this on the U.S.A. made filters, and the company had better keep a tight handle on quality control in case other manufacturing issues turn up.This problem is not serious enough to downgrade my initial 4-star rating.
I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone.I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it.I used this on my wifes 06 corolla I also have K&N filters in our motorcycles and my truck.  I've used this product for years to clean all sorts of reusable filters from foam to fabric.  Works great and I like that the cleaning solution is relatively un-offensive meaning that you can use it in the kitchen before rinsing the filter.  Good stuff, can't go wrong with K&N products.
This is a good low cost feeler gauge set that is suitable for your shop.  Recommend this one for most applications.This stuff works great and wow, when you pay $1.00 in the auto store for a little squirt, this is a tremendous deal!!I like using this mitt - I use it for waxing not washing... It's not great for initially working in wax - you can't beat a good microfiber cloth for that, but for a solid once over afterwards, this is a great mitt.
Like is the word and not love.For my 1998 shadow ace vt750c.Requires the original honda spark plug tool due to clearance issues.Improve fuel economy? Nah.Improved performance? Nah.If you find hard enough, their website rated this plugs good to go for 50 000 KM.The denso are better made and packaged. Have a smaller tip and a U groove electrode which can last 30 000KM. But since there is no difference in using a normal and iridium plug for my bike, mileage is more important.Only reason to use this is if your plugs are difficult to get to or you dread spark plug changes.Pro's:  Does everything you need at a fraction of the price of DeWalt or other various polishers. Secondly, it seems very heavy duty, I expect to use this machine for years.Con's:  IT'S HEAVY! NEARLY 10lbs! Ok so your saying to yourself that doesn't sound so bad right?  Well after hours of working with it, your arm will become like a noodle.  Secondly, the two backing plates that come standard with it are worthless, throw them away!  Plan on purchasing a Meguiars or a 3M backing plate to pair with this polisher.  I went with Meguiars W68 backing plate but the W66 would be an equally good choice. Another major Con instead of telling you RPM's on the dial which is pretty standard the dial reads 1 2 3 4 so its hard to know exactly what speed your at, wish they had followed their competition on speed selection.Bottom Line: For the price you can overlook every Con.People need to understand about motor oil to make the decision on what is right for them including if Royal Purple is what they should use or not.  Forget the marketing, and anything else that suggests this or any oil will do anything "spectacular".  What it can do is what a good motor oil can do, lubricate and help protect an engine from wear (when combined with a good filter). The synthetic oils benefits occur most when an engine is subjected to the extremes, high RPM, high stress, high/low temp situations where it will remain effective better than a conventional oil. Synthetic oils may also maintain their original properties a while longer than conventional oils.  That is it however. That is very important stuff, what motor oil is for. That is good enough, all that should be expected. But it is still motor oil. Any claims of this or any other oil making your car go faster or get better MPG or anything like that should not be believed. That is not the job of motor oil.The definition of "synthetic oil" in this Country is vague and most oils labeled "fully synthetic" are not made from 100% synthetic base stocks. To find out more about how this works look up Mobil Vs Castrol, this was the lawsuit in this country that allowed oils that originated from dino oil to legally be called "fully synthetic".  This does not mean they are bad oils, just that the use of the work synthetic can be misleading.One would need to look to see what base stocks are used to see just how fully synthetic an oil truly is. The base stocks in motor oil are Group I,II,III,IV and V base stocks. Group I-III (1-3) are all conventional mineral oils that have come from the ground. Dino oil. Only Group IV and V use synthetic base stocks (P.A.O. for group IV) and (Esters for group V).95% of oils labeled "fully synthetic" actually begin with group III base stocks which are then highly processed in to the final product.This does not mean that an oil is bad because it is not a true "fully synthetic" oil using 100% group IV or V base stocks or better just because it does use them, but this is something I think is misleading and not understood by most. Though being a true group IV oil using those P.A.O. base stocks is considered better by many. It is an indication of a high quality oil, and certainly meets the definition of a true fully synthetic oil, just not the only consideration.There is much more to an oil than just the base stocks used. The formulations are very complex including many additives with detergent and anti-wear properties along with several others. Many factors go in to making a top quality motor oil.I would not suggest one think they can go incredibly long times between oil changes just because they are using a high quality oil or because a certain mileage figure is on the label. When used with a good filter one may be able to go longer between changes with a good oil, but to protect your engine better you also need to keep clean and fresh enough oil of any type in it. This oil is no exception. Your oil may be capable of outlasting your filter. Some find that changing filters more often than their oil helps extend change intervals. Also there is more to consider when determining oil change intervals than just mileage. Engine type (does it have a turbo for example), environmental extremes etc. also need to be considered. And time is a consideration too because while the oil itself may not be "worn out" or the additive package in it may still be effective (particularly in Extended Performance versions which contain larger amounts) still there are contaminants that oil filters do not remove which are a result of the combustion process, over time these build up and can only be removed by changing your oil. This is also why if you use a vehicle seasonally such as storing your motorcycle over the winter it is best to change the oil when you put it away rather than at the start of the season.If you look on the bottles of oils with claims they can go for long periods of time between oil changes (15K plus) you will find some small print saying things such as "Do not alter oil change intervals from manufacturer requirements on vehicles under warranty (as this will likely VOID your warranty not keeping the maintenance schedule)" and "25,000 miles OR ONE YEAR" as well as many other various conditional statements about the vehicle operating conditions. What may be OK under ideal and perfect conditions is different from most all real situations.Some people engage in oil testing, sending their oil to labs to find out condition of the oil.  For me this seems perhaps reasonable if one it attempting to find out what length change interval they are able to obtain with a certain oil/filter combination.  However as something done on a regular basis for the average consumer this costs as much as an oil change so I would just change the oil instead of finding out the condition the old oil is in.As to Royal Purple being a good synthetic oil? I would say yes it is. Also very expensive particularly with this deal. If it is either the best or worth the price is the larger questions to consider. Is it worth it at this price? I would say NO it was recently on sale for 6.99/quart, at that time or the next time it goes on sale that is the prime time to purchase. Personally I prefer other brands, though my decisions are changing along with the changing of formulations of the oils I use. One should do research in to various synthetic motor oils and consider those as well and decide which one to use. Do not go by marketing claims. There are independent tests and discussions, there is even one with over 1000 posts on this subject on Amazon right now. Many other outside oil forums as well. One can also have their oil tested to compare results vs other brands used at various intervals in their own vehicle if one wants to do that sort of personal research which will yield at least some results.  Also formulations are constantly changing so what ingredients used in any particular oil one year may not be what the formulation is today or will be tomorrow. If you research oil and decide that it is worth paying a bit more for a true group IV oil, then that is a reasonable decision to pay a bit more for that oil. I believe this RP is among Group IV oils, meaning it uses 100% synthetic base stocks.  But contact Royal Purple to confirm this because their formulations change like all others. Make sure you know what you are buying.I would also encourage purchasing any oil when it is on a big sale or has a rebate etc.. I believe most synthetics are overpriced and should be purchased only when on sale as this does happen on a regular basis. Check Amazon and other auto supply stores. There are constantly sales on synthetic oils and/or rebates making the cost per quart 6.00 or less on a regular basis, this is the time to purchase your oil.  Often there are packages with filters which can be good deals as long as the filter is the one you would like to use also.  This nor any other oil will perform well without also using a high quality filter, period. Make sure you are also using a high quality filter. The two need to both be of good quality for best performance and protection.I give this a 4 star rating due to price. It has been on sale for less recently and that is the time to purchase expensive oils. Plan ahead and buy your oil when on a really good sale. You can save about 50% or at least close to it often times especially when offered with packages including an oil filter (as long as it is a good filter). The star rating reflects the value of this deal at this price.In the end get a high quality oil but remember no oil is going to be providing its full benefits if it is no longer effective due to excessive use or age.  Keep your maintenance schedules up to get the best performance and longest life out of your vehicle.Royal Purple IS one in the group of top quality motor oils, just where it ranks is much more difficult to determine.  Disregard outrageous claims made by any manufacturer or person and do your own research in to various synthetic oils to make a decision on which to use.  There are several very good quality brands. Also learn about API, ILSAC and Dexos1 specifications mean. This Royal Purple DOES meet the most current API specification (SF) the ILSAC GF-5 and GM's new Dexos1 requirements. It should be compared against other synthetics that also meet those same specifications. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT RATINGS. These are your best street car motor oils. So YES this is a good oil, NO it will not do anything other high quality synthetic oils in the same class can do, and No this is not the best price I have seen for this oil.Instead of comparing claims on a bottle (other than those API, ILSAC and perhaps Dexos1 ratings) do some outside research. Ignore outrageous claims and make an informed decision based upon knowledge of the oil and filters you purchase and what an appropriate price to purchase them at is.EDIT: Note that at the time of the review Royal Purple was using PAO base stocks.  I have information that it is not not a 100% PAO oil. This has been a pattern among oils that were once 100% PAO group IV oils so you can not count on any brand maintaining their formulations or advising or a new formulation or change.  There are some advantages to a PAO oil such as no need for V.I. additives and if you believe in the value of P.A.O. base stock oils that could justify a slightly higher purchase price.  My belief in this change is a response to this question by a representative or Royal Purple.  This does not mean it is no longer a good oil to buy just that the formulation may no longer use P.A.O. base stocks.  One should know what they are paying for particularly if they are purchasing a product at a premium price especially if that product no longer uses the ingredients one things it does.
When buying a new car, they always fill the fluid tank with the regular blue washer fluid. I can either extract all of that fluid and replace with Rain-X fluid, or use the additive. I found the additive to be similar to the Rain-X treatment, but possibly more concentrated. I poured 4 oz into my fluid tank, and it worked. Water droplets tend to sheet away at speeds above 45 mph. Is it better than the full treatment? Of course not, but I found that using just the Rain-X wiper fluid was sufficient, and this additive is only going to be used until I consume the original fluid. After that, I would start using the orange Rain-X wiper fluid year-round.I didn't have any issues with streaking, water marks, or anything negative. This additive works.Overall: 5/5 starsI put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY&#8230; Way&#8230; Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.Great stuff every one should have some laying around!I've had to use this twice this year.  I hit a log two different times this year, breaking off the front tracking fin on our '01 Malibu each time.This stuff is easy to use and dries rock hard.  It sands well but is a good idea to get it as flat as possible before sanding.  Due to the location and most of the repair being covered by the tracking fin, I haven't taken the effort to polishing this up to a shine like I've read you can do.  I have read that you should avoid using this if you intend to gel coat over top of it, as gel doesn't stick well to it.Great product that I'm sure I'll be stuck using again next year.
I bought this to look in my winch on my Jeep. I just took one of the bolts out and put this in, I would thing if they really want it I'm sure they can get it out, this just makes it a little harder and if you install two they will have to work twice as hard. And for the price you can buy two..Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good Luckthis product does work, like all the rave reviews have said.  What I don't like is it doesn't go a long way, so that's why 3 stars. I was only able to do 7 wheels (so I couldn't even finish 2 cars) and at the end I had to use a brush to get the last of the small stuff out.  So doesn't completely work by itself just spraying off and doesn't go a long way
Works great on the calipers. goes on nice and thick, however the nose is so small, so it is hard to squeeze it out. Warm it in your hand - it will helpThe chair rolls easily and is well constructed. The pad is thick enough to make sitting on it comfortable. I use the chair often while waxing or detailing the sides of a vehicle which is hard on my back and knees without the chair.This is very handy to have around the house.  Works on any glass surface and truly makes it look invisible.  Just spray and wipe away in straight lines with a towel.  Works well on car windows too, and is safe to use on tinted windows.
If it moves and it shouldn't, Loctite.  I like to use this for small items that I will need to take apart in the future, but I do not want to have loosen up during use.  Like tiny screws in a gun or something else small and hard to replace.This stuff is not too stinky so you don't have to use it outside. It bonds very well to anything I have tried it with and sets up quickly, but not too quickly. One thing I used it for was cementing the dryer exhaust vent to the house. Just be sure to mix it up with something disposable -- I use a paper plate and a popsicle stick. It will dry to a gray color, so don't use it on something that needs to be clear.Yes, it lasts a really long time.  However, the reason for 3 stars is this product is extremely difficult to buff off if you let it sit too long.  If you miss a spot, it will harden into cement...the kind where clay bar, degreaser, and dish soap won't even get it off.  Nu Finish also stains rubber and plastic.There's other sealants available that make your car look great, last just as long, and are a breeze to apply and buff.  I use Menzerna Power Lock now, and I can let it haze for hours and it wipes right off.  Doesn't stain glass, plastic, or rubber so you can speed through application without having to tape everything off.  Just like Nu Finish, it survives tons of washes no problem.Bottom line: I'm sure this stuff was the bee's knees 20 years ago, but times have changed and there's better products available from many manufacturers (Menzerna, Blackfire, Wolfgang, Zaino, etc).  Don't be afraid to try different waxes/sealants...you're not married to one for life.
I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.Tried this in my Tundra to see if I could clear up a weird hesitation issue after changing plugs, cleaning sensors, etc, etc. No change after using, but I've read many good things about this product. I'm going to order another and try it in some lawn equipment next :)I am very surprised how well this works and how easy it is to use. When I read all the reviews, I thought everyone was just exaggerating. At first I was skeptical that it was possible to wash my car with this and a bucket of water. I have a 2011 green camaro and I would never take her to a car wash place. I have many detailing product and this is my favorite. I used to use other car soap to wash my car and I always had to wax it after to get it to shine. No I simply wash the car and it gives my car a very deep shine with so little effort. I bought a bucket that collects dirt at the bottom from chemical guys. I mix two capful of this and half bucket of water. Make sure to buy good and absorbant micro fiber cloth. If you do it right it shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to wash your car and it will shine as if you waxed it. If the car is very dirty, i usually rince it off with a hose first then apply this stuff with a micro fiber cloth. Then use two more cloth to dry the car. Its best to do the car one section at a time, sides, front and back of car.
This is the old stand-by and works very well - you can always turn so you can see the dial.  It doesn't always sit well on the stems for some reason, but using this with an air compressor is so much faster than a small 12-volt compressor and hand gauge.I use this for my hi-lift, just as nature intended. As advertised, it keeps the jack handle isolated and free from noise while driving. Keep in mind, when it comes time to use the jack, you will need to unbolt the chain mount typically placed on top of the jack to remove the handle isolator completely, which is a bit of a nuisance. Still though, this is an essential part for anyone with a Hi Lift jack.I know that nothing is theft proof. All we can do is make it as inconvenient for the thief as possible, so maybe he will move on to an easier target.This lock would not be easily opened with hand tools... a torch or grinder would probably be required, making the attempted theft a bit obvious from the showers of sparks.The round style keys are much harder to pick than a traditional tumbler method.So far, I haven't found any faults with this device... but I will update later in the summer when it has had some use.

Easy to apply, easy to use. Moisten the surface to be cleaned lightly with a bit of water spray, then pour some Lexol cleaner on your hands. Don't worry, it's safe (as are most leather cleaning products. Remember, leather is basically skin). Rub it in everywhere, then use a soft brush to agitate the surface. Use a wet cloth to wipe the Lexol off. Bam! Clean as can be. You might be surprised how dirty your chair can get when you see the colour of the Lexol foam after scrubbing. Make sure you apply leather conditioner/oil after cleaning to maintain the leather itself. This product is only the cleaner side of things.I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself.I love the nut on top of the K&N oil filters.  Makes it easy to change on my CBR Blackbird.  I change the oil frequently so am not sure how well the media cleans the oil.
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself.I purchased Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Wax to use on an old Corvette I purchased. The car's finish was in pretty good shape despite being 22 years old. Since the paint was original, I didn't want anything to harsh, and I wanted to do it by hand. Much to my surprise, Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Wax made the car look almost like new. The paint color is black, and it shines like a mirror. When my neighbor saw my car, he asked if I had it repainted. Besides looking great, the wax was also easy to get on and off. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it other than it costs more than most waxes. But in this case, you definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommended.I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.
If you ride around the roads of south Florida then you need this product in your tires. You will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! It worksIt's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it.Do what as it says and you'll get the results you wanted. don't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint. otherwise, this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxing
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.Ordered this so we could do oil change jobs on our 2010 equinox.  Yes it works for the 2.4 as well as the 2.2 that its advertised for.  Does the job as intended.  Don't like the way chevy set up their filters but oh well what can you do.Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks.
I have a possible solution for the tight-coupler problem. I used to have a Caterpillar grease gun that had to be pried off the fitting just like this gun does. It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun.  This works for me.  Good luck.I bought this to charge the battery on my 99 Lexus GS400.  The battery has gone dead a couple times and I was ready to buy a replacement but thought I would get this and try it.  Its a battery re-born!  Works like new now... this lil baby does a great job of slow charging and also tells you the battery percentage.  Its made well, very compact and is asthetically pleasing to the eye.  I also love that it has storage in the back to put the cables/clips for storage.If you need a battery charger...this is THE one to get!Buy with confidence!I have a K&N in my car so I decided to add this to the girlfriends.  She has a 2006 Toyota Matrix. It fits snug, but that means there's a good seal. Her stock filter was horribly dirty after just one year, so it'll be interesting how this holds up. It's impossible to tell if there is any improvement in performance. I don't drive it daily so I'm not sure about the gas mileage either. Buy this for its reusability, not its performance. My only complaint is the little "Do Not Discard" sticker isn't sticky enough to attach to the air box.
Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!If you want to help your cooling system be more efficent,Then this product is what you need. 1oz per quart of cooling system . And watch the temp drop. Must have for better cooling.Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products.If you want a good shine that will last because you hate waxing your car, then this is for you. I used it and it really did almost last for a year. I would say maybe 6-8 months or so. That is pretty good and close to a year. Be sure that your car is as clean as possible, you may want to use a polish before using this, but you are probably lazy since you hate waxing your car, so you can use this right after your car is washed. If you want to do the once over on your paint, once a year, I would recommend the following: Wash your car using Meguiars Gold Class; it is an excellent shampoo and conditioner for your car. Clay bar your car. The clay bar is probably the easiest product to use. It is almost effortless. You mist a section 18&#34; x 18&#34; with a quick detailer (yes Meguiars has an excellent quick detailer), then you use the clay bar with medium pressure. Make about 10 passes. Then you lightly wipe dry. Your paint will be very slick and you should not feel any grit after using it. Do NOT drop the clay or you may scratch the heck out of your paint.You have to throw it out and use a fresh clay bar. After you have completed the entire car with the clay bar, you can then use a polish. Yes I know Nu finish states that it is a polish, but we will pretend it is a protectant. Use a polish (similar to Meguiars polish - yes I love Meguiars products and no I do not have stock in the company). Then you can apply the Nu finish. One reviewer said to dampen the applicator; that is probably a good idea. Do one section at a time. As with any &#34;protectant products&#34; if you use too much it will be difficult to remove. Since you are going to be doing this once every 6-8 months, take the extra time and effort to do it correctly. After the Nu finish, may I suggest that you use Meguiars NXT 2.0. It is a polymer sealant that works very well. In summary:  Wash, Clay Bar, Polish, Nu Finish, and the optional poly sealant. If you are very lazy you can do your car in 2 steps. Drive it through the expensive car wash, and then use the Nu Finish. Good luck.Just a smidge of this product will turn a once tarnished nasty piece of aluminum into a beautiful shine that you wouldn't believe. Really you can see your reflection in the surface after polishing it up. Will always purchase Mothers Mag and Al polish
I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.You get pretty much everything you need to do a proper hand wash/wax, as well as take care of some minor detailing.wash &#62; clay bar &#62; paint scratch repair &#62; wax &#62; headlights/exterior plastics &#62; tire dressingI haven't used the interior stuff yet. Not sure if I trust it since all similar products I've used give that glossy, shiny finish...which I can't stand.Again, these guys are hard to do without.  They are doing the job!  I don't buy the 3-pack, I prefer to buy the individuals in quantities of 3 because, for some reason, I get free shipping on the individual ones, but not on the multi pack one.  So, it came out cheaper to buy them a la carte.  Go Figure!
I lube my slideout and other seals and gaskets on my motorhome about twice a year.  This works well on the gaskets of the storage compartments.  Be aware that it is really messy to spray on.  You have to open your slides to access the seals, and this comes out of the can similar to engine degreaser - a foam that is messy.  It gets on the painted surfaces and needs to be wiped off promptly. With a straw from another lube can, I can spray it on the top gasket which is almost impossible to reach.  For the side gaskets on the slideout, I find that it is less messy to put on a plastic glove, spray it in my hand, and rub it on.  Works okay that way.  If you are on the road, and your slideout seal is sticking or binding, try baby power. This is an effective product, but Thetford needs to change the nozzle to control the mess.I used this on my vinyl deck where a protective pad for the grill had left a huge stain. The stain was removed with minimal effort. It also took some sticker residue off a plastic waste basket, the kind of residue that grabs dirt and dust if you can't get the entire label off cleanly the first time you peel it off; sometimes those labels just won't budge.Moving on, it removed a light dusting of latex paint (pale yellow) from a sealed hardwood floor, and also was handy for a pet stain on the wall (DO NOT ASK me about that stain. I'm still shuddering from the clean-up) and it also worked on the soot on the back of the glass over the fireplace.Summary: cleans evil dirt, smells divine. A must-have in my arsenal of home maintenance items.You only need a few things to get your home detailing kit started and the Grit Guard is at the top of the list. If you are doing a 2-bucket wash then Grit Guards are 100% necessary. No questions asked.For those that do not know what a Grit Guard is, this little device sits on the bottom of your wash/rinse buckets and allows dirt and sediment to drop into the bottom of your bucket. After you wash a panel you rinse your wash mitt in the RINSE bucket and rub the mitt along the Grit Guard on the bottom. This helps knock dirt out of the mitt so you can have a clean mitt to wash the next panel of the car. The little fins on the bottom of the Girt Guard help keep the water from swirling and disturbing the dirt that has settled on the bottom of the bucket.Necessary Items for Home Car Wash:1. 2 Buckets2. 2 Grit Guards3. Microfiber Wash Mitt (I recommend 2 - one for top panels, one for bottom)4. Car Wash SoapThese basic supplied can get you started. Once you get a basic wash kit then I guarantee you will want to expand and look into microfiber towels, waffle weave drying towels, clay bar kit, wax, etc.
Very neat tool to remove battery post without twisting or jerking cables try to pull them out from battery .This tool also can be used to remove windshield wiper arms or other small job need to slowly easy to pull out the part. Good to have in tool box, special for mechanic use to replace battery when remove cables .I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.
Works as will as other seal pullers I've used.When using a seal puller for my 16&#34; FV wheels I've found that I need to use the assistance of a 5 lbs hammer to pull the seal.Of cource replace the seal with a new one. This is a common practice of RV repair shops.This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand. The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn. The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer. Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.  I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle. I probably won't have to use it ever again. In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount.This is actually my second K&N; filter purchase for the same vehicle.  I find it easier to have two so I can quickly swap them out and have the car ready to go while I wash, clean and more importantly let dry the other filter.  I've never had any issues with this filter, been using it on my 08 Toyota Highlander V6 for over 50k miles so far.  I have cleaned the MAF twice as part of my routine maintenance procedure using CRC Mass Air Flow Cleaner.  The stuff works like a charm.  Use this filter on the 08 Highlander 3.5 V6 with confidence, just my opinion of course!Note: this is a tight fit for the my vehicle, so please make sure you have some patience.  Tip:  Disconnect the main intake hose first (loosen the collar with a 10mm socket).  and then remove all of the mini vacuum hoses and then loosen the two 10mm lid screws.  The whole top should come free.
This did the trick for me, needed to be able to measure tread depth and it does work, its a little confusing to begin with, but once you use it, its easy to use and very handy as well.Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc.Bought this to add extra outlets to my Goldwing, and it worked like a charm. Simple to hook up, and there are other adapters to add that make things real easy to put power where you need it. I might even use it for what it was intended, and get a Battery Tender unit so I can keep the battery topped off during down times.
Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.I have a 1993 M35A3 with 6 Michelin 14.5 XLs and a spare.  The CTIS (central tire inflation system) had been disconnected, and the split wheel o-rings need to be replaced.  This means that I have 7 huge tires with slow leaks.  I have the truck in an apartment complex parking lot with no electricity for my big Makita 5hp compressor.  And my honda generator cant crank over the Makita.  I had a little red compressor from VIAR, which was good in the emergency I needed it for, but got so hot in inflating these tires that it melted the yellow hose.The 450P was hooked up to my yellow goodyear hose and Subaru Outback (running), and put to work right out of the box.  It took 5 of these tires from 15 lbs or less to 45 lbs in about 35 minutes.  When you have 13,000 lbs of truck, having tires that roll is critical, because even a wrecker can't move them with deflated tires.  The pump was hot, but the inflating pipe on the compressor runs through the padded handle, which allows you to pick it up when hot.  The gauge has a trigger and a  lever that holds fitting on to the tire valve, which is really handy.  Having a switch vs using the battery clamps to start saves on sparking.I was at a loss as to how I was going to get these tires inflated in remote situations with out a huge generator to run a huge compressor...so this continuous duty 12v pump was very timely.(for those of you who are military truck experts, I am aware the M35A3 has an on board compressor, but there is a blockage somewhere ahead of the 'glad hands.')  The M35A3 is about the largest truck (23,000 lbs gvw) you can drive in NC without a license , and has 7 really big tires to say grace over.  This is not a replacement for a functioning CTIS or a big compressor, but will get even the largest tires inflated and rolling.Bought a new weight distribution hitch that came equipped with a 2&#34; ball ... I needed a 2-5/16&#34; ball for my larger travel trailer but wanted one with the larger big beefy 1-1/4&#34; shank ... my WD hitch had a hole for that size and NO WAY would I go buy a 2-5/16&#34; ball with a smaller diameter shank and use a spacer in it!I want to best thickest built ball and shank and I could not find a ball this size with this larger shank here locally.Price was great and I love having a big bad boy ball and shank to pull the 5-6K load of my trailer.
No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.I use this every day.  I use a cable to lock my helmet and jacket to the front disk bike with this lock.  It is substantial and the chrome makes it obvious to any would-be thieves.  The mechanism is very smooth.  I oil mine once in a while to keep it working well.  Honestly I don't know how well it will hold up to a grinder and hope I never will.
Good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room. I use this on my ATV for the batt charger since I put a basket on it. Don't have to crawl under to hook it up.I used this for an oil change on a 2007 Saturn Vue Hybrid. I find it odd how the GM ecotec have the oil filter canister right below the exhaust manifold. This socket fits under it without a problem allowing it to have room to unscrew the filter out of the canister. Worth the buy if you ever plan on changing the oil in your GM Ecotec vehicle! Or just to have in general in case you ever get a friend to change your oil for you!I use this as a secondary lock on my travel trailer during storage on my property, along with a "boot" on one of the tires, as well as a hardened padlock on the hitch's latch. This lock is easily installed and removed from the 2 5/8" trailer hitch.  When we head out to the campground , the heavy boot stays home and this lock comes along , just to "keep the honest people honest" . Let's face it, you can spend more money and buy a heavier lock with a higher degree of protection, no question.  But when you consider how many trailers are sitting around with ZERO anti-theft devices on them.....well, let's just say there are much easier targets available nearby, for a would-be thief.  Well worth the $25 if you currently have nothing.....and yes, it makes sense to spend more money on a lock ,if you have a toy hauler full of expensive , "irreplaceable" stuff , or a super-sweet boat, or have had trailer theft problems in the past.
It is exactly as it is advertised. It seems well built. If this is what you need just buy it.Very sturdy, bright color, well made. This is what you need in a chock although I cannot find a weight rating.Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat.
You know those expensive "headlight restoration" kits you can get?  Well, you can actually use an abrasive polish (like this one) and achieve much the same result.  I use masking tape around the edges of my headlights, then use an orbital polisher with a firm pad to polish my headlights using this compound.  It's very adept at removing that thin layer of yellowish oxidation which makes headlights more opaque than clear.  Best of all, this bottle has a lot of compound in it and you could polish your headlights probably 75 times on one bottle before running out.So there is that... but it's also good on paint.Over the years I have found the best use of a rubbing compound is to either restore heavily oxidized finishes (with no clearcoat), or to remove paint/scuff deposits on a small area of your car.Be advised that this is a very abrasive compound and you should NOT use this as a general purpose polish for a newer car finish.  Every time you use this product you remove a tiny layer from your car's finish.  Remember that and use with caution.  If someone bumps into your new car in the parking lot and left a paint scuff, this is the ideal product to get it off with.  If you have an old car that's been sitting out in the sun too long and has faded a bit, you can use this product on the entire car to bring it back to its near-original shine by removing that layer of oxidation which makes it look dull.So whether you own a new car or old one, this is a great product to keep in the garage for detailing days.This stuff works. Had a flat in the middle of no where and this got me back on the trail. Works simply. You will need a valve core removal tool and a air compressor. I purchased a &#34;KIT&#34; that has everything you need. Purchased this bottle of &#34;Slime&#34; so incase I get another flat, I will have some. Just a heads up, this is meant at a temporary fix to get you to a repair place. Will last a while.We were in need of replacement awning pull strap and figured this would be a good brand.No problems with the length or the strap, the t slider piece however could be a little stifferand thicker to give a solid feel.  As it it does work fine I just worry that the strap willpull out of the awning slot.
I was impressed with the power of this little unit which I use to blow out water from around lights, the honeycomb grill, crevices, and other hard or impossible places to reach by hand after washing my car.  I then finish the dry process using a MF towel sprayed with Optimum Instant Detailer to get fantastic results with no spots.  Just be aware you must use an extension cord with this blower as the built-in cord is extremely short.I love this funnel, it has so many uses. For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. Let's see a hammer do either of those things. My hammer never stays put. You can reason with this funnel, it has an open mind so to speak. Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel.Im writing this review because I read the negatives that some peoole have with this product. U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls. No liquid, in any way, will ever put swirls in a car. The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product. Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second, and the one people have the most difficulty with, is how hard it is to wipe this off. This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car. The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water, put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator. Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does. Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off. This is a sealant, it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years, applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick. After a rainfall, the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof, as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove, simply apply more and rub off.
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.Does what it says it does......looks great !This product has been proven to work well. It does what it promises to do and very well. I recommend it to anyone.
I just ordered this for my new trailer but I installed it about 8 years ago on my last trailer and it works like a charm. This is so easy to use at dump stations or at sites to clean out tanks. I simply attach the hose to it and turn it on and it will spray the inside of the tank and well as fill it fast to dump it out clean. We travel all summer and fast means everything when the families packed and ready to pull out.If you are handy ((I would rate this install on a scale of 1 to 10 for difficulty a 5)) you can install it to your tank. My last trailer the black tank was exsposed under trailer so it was super easy. Just drill down 2 inches from top of tank at opposite end (if you can) of drain out with a 1-1/4 inch wood type drill. Anu central location of tank will be fine.Then add silicon around hole insert sparyer and screw in 3 screws. Thats the hardest part. Then you run the hose from tank to the side of the trailer and screw that in. Once the silicon drys your all set. I never had a problem with it leaking ever and I used it hard for 8 summers. Does a great job!My new trailer the tanks are enclosed under a plastic type covering which I had to pull off one side 10 feet to get to tanks. It was not really that big a deal and the covering screwed back up like new. Maybe someone less handy may want to see whats involved on their unit 1st to see what it will take to install.UPDATE JUNE 2013. I just bought A motorhome and 1st thing I did was install flush to black tank and like always works like a charm!!!It also says right on package If it starts to leak find Alan wrench and tighten inside it may come a little loose and drip, no big deal.This product will make your life so easy specially when your in line at a dump station and want to rinse your tank and get moving.I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank.
Disclosure: I am not basing my review on first hand experience but the way it is I could trust that this guy works. When car is upside down, this keychain would stay in place in the ignition ring and you could quickly find it and pull it. Breaks glass with 1-2 tries but not wind shield. Practice in the junkyard and you'll see and the quickest way to cut the seatbelt.I was expecting a solid pad, like a hockey puck, but was surprised to find out that it has voids under the surface. If you turn it upside down, it will hold water.  I have not tried it on my floor jack yet, but the picture of the product is deceiving if you expect it to be solid all the way through.When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it...
I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump.I use this battery tender for my Harley Davidson. With the OEM security system, the Harley can drain a battery quickly, making it a hard start on those cool fall mornings. When we are up north at our lake home, the HD does not have a garage to be placed in, so I will use this  battery tender outside and did not trust using the normal battery tender out side with not protection, so I was using a pail to place over the tender. Now I can use this one without worry.Would purchase again.I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank.  Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon.  But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work.UPDATE:  I was able to actually use this in my generator afterall.  I had to insert the hose at an angle to reach a certain part of the gas tank and it worked like a charm. But, you need to use the up/down motion really really fast to start it off and then it will siphon. I guess it takes a little practice and a little patience. Once you get it right you'll have no problem doing the next time. I keep this in my truck now in case I ever need it.
Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.This is a nice alternative to welding a tab on a hitch for a sway control. While I don't plan on having to move it to another hitch it is nice to know that if I had to I could. Which is something that can't be done with a weld on tab.
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPSThis product meet all that I need it to do, this item I has a tough and rough skin. If you need to use this item for semi-full time mounted in order to charge a battery that does not always get used, this would be the right choose.
Until you use it you can not comment on it.Others have told me it works great for getting a flat fixed until you can make it to a repair shop.I have never had a flat or needed to use anything like this before.But wanted it for my Harley Sportster.  Better to have it than call a tow truck.I bought these some time ago.I use them mainly to detail my vehicles, cleaning glass is great, just don't use too much glass spray and your windows will turn up crystal clear.I use them "dry" to dust my dash/ door handle, etc...though you can use a quick spritz of some interior detail spray to make it even better.Keep a few in the car incase the windows fog up, these worked great.And you can use in the house as well.....things you can wipe down are only limited to your imagination.wife loves it and will be used in the car. I hope it holds up over time.  will give further feedback
I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it.I was very optimist about this product to help avoiding the stabalizers to sink in the grass, this past weekend I used for the first time in the grass, it rained and it sank deep and when I pulled the stabilizers up, and removed the pads they were bent, they do not hold their flat struture in a "soft" grass, if you do grass camping with motorhome that will not work, I am thinking I will still need a piece of 2x6 under the pad.I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps.

Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface.  Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.
Tore the bumper on my RV. I do not blame this thing for the problem, the bumper just could not handle the force of two bikes and a bike rack ( total weight about 80 lbs ) running down a bumpy road. It started to tear a hole near the weld to the frame of the trailer. Did not notice it for a few days until I could see the bike rack sagging. Don't get me wrong, this thing is built VERY solidly ( and mounts perfectly to a 4&#34; square bumper ). I am really writing this to warn others thinking of using this as I did. You really need someone to weld something to the bumper to make it stronger ( or replace the bumper with a stronger one ) before using this, or maybe use a very light bike rack with a very light bike.What was I thinking? What was I expecting for 4 bucks? I thought I was getting a solid hard plastic product(maybe I didn't read closely enough). Instead I got cheap hollow thin walled plastic that isn't fit to chock a tricycle, let alone a 10,0000 lb trailer. These things will obliterate the first time a tire even comes in contact. Your tongue jack, and stabilizers are the only thing that will hold you. Don't even think about using them when you disconnect from your truck unless you're on perfectly level ground. use a piece of fire wood. These things will crack like an egg in cold weather, and melt like putty on any day over 60 degrees. Isn't there some sort of safety standards for this sort of product? Don't waste your money.Wasn't even worth the time to return.This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.  I'm using it for that occasionally, but I'm a little worried about it...
I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle.The only thing I have against scissor jacks is that after they have been raised to the height prior to having to level my 31' RV, it requires quite a hefty force to raise it for leveling. The included socket and turn handle had the pin break at the socket and I had to improvise with an icepick for a temporary repair. A Camco socket that I purchased also for using fit perfect, but a 3/8" drill wanted to burn out tring to raise the jacks. I plan to use something more powerful next time. I'd like to see some gearing on the crank to make the jack raise easier when leveling my rv. THe Jack does have the strength and ability to take the weight without any problem.This valve is exactly what I needed to make draining the hot water tank in my RV a breeze. Unfortunately, it arrived with a quality control problem - the T-handle was not properly crimped onto the valve shaft. The first time I tried to use the valve, the handle came right off in my hand. Rather than fool aroung with the nuisance of returning it, I reworked the crimp with a hammer & punch. I was able to make it secure enough that I can use the valve without the handle coming loose. Hopefully, it will not work loose & be lost due to vibrations on the road.
Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.It's intended for easy cutting the paint. A nice thing Meguiar's been doig is having the scale shown on the label. This is one of the lowest indexes available for paint cutting.For the amount it comes (16oz) it should last for about years to come using on a single car.I'll try it with my PorterCable to figure out if it was a good purchase and this will be updated. If the case, I'll buy from other brands like Wolfgang or Black Diamond (better rated but 2x the price). Anyways, wait for the update.a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied.
Holding the can about 4 inches from the slide-out rubber seals, this spays an even coat of protectant over the the entire surface including the foam seals.I was expecting to have to spray on and wipe it to get the coverage.  Simple application.  My seals were thirsty for this stuff.  Hope it saves from replacing them anytime in the near future!Not much to say, other than to let people know these work on Ford vehicles.I installed them on my Truck and my wife's Escape.  Both vehicles only use 2 screws so I was able to use one package for the 2 vehicles.On my truck I took the extra time to reach behind and put the white plastic "nut" on the end of the screw (on the tip of the screw that stuck through the bumper).  This will make it pretty much impossible to remove the screws without holding onto the nut.(I think the white plastic thing is actually meant as a bushing for larger holes???)For my wife's escape I couldn't reach the back side of the screw without take apart the hatch so I just put the screws in.Like others have said, this isn't "bulletproof" - but it will deter theft.  I could take out the old screws with my pocketknife so anyone walking by could steal the license plate in about 10 seconds time.  This will prevent that type of theft...These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72102 high tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway.
I have purchased other tire gauges from Accutire and have found them to be sturdy, long lasting and accurate. I purchased this gauge for use on my Honda Goldwing motorcycle. I needed a right angle low clearance gauge to clear the brake disks and check my suspension pressure. I also have found the gauge convenient for my wife's Honda 50, 2013 Honda CRV w/TPM valves and my ATV's. With this gauge I don't have to bend or place angle pressure on the sides of the tire valve stems.Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car!I've learned that changing the oxygen sensors, like many DIY activities, is more challenging than it seems.  But with the right tools, it can be rather painless.  On my car, a Toyota Camry, I used an open-ended wrench on the downstream sensor, but this socket was necessary to access the upstream sensor under the hood.This socket is very heavy-duty, fits snugly over the oxygen sensor, and offers the option of using a 3/8" socket wrench or an open-ended/box wrench, depending on what you find more comfortable.  It is perfect for the job.Based on my experience, I strongly recommend that you get part numbers off your oxygen sensors in order to ensure you get the correct replacements.  You'll need to remove the sensors to read the part numbers.  I ordered my sensors ahead of time, following Amazon and other web sites' recommendations.  After pulling my old sensors, I found that I had to re-order both.Back to the socket, though, it's heavy duty, fits perfectly, and just right for removing/installing oxygen sensors.
Let me state up front - I was my car a lot and I mean a lot. Two to three times a week or more. I normally use soft cotton bath towels and change them out as I go so I always have one semi dry towel to remove the last bit of water. I don't have problems with this method as I clean my towels often and keep my car waxed so the system works well for me. No scratches or swirls.But...I thought I might be missing something so I got one of these towels and frankly I really can't see the point. While it might be softer than a normal cotton or terrycloth towel and does soak up a lot of water, it pretty much stays wet after that. You can wring it out, but it just spreads water after the initial use no matter how much you wring it. If you're going to use it as a first pass to soak up the majority of the water then I guess it's okay. But as your car starts to dry you end up putting more water down then was there when you started. Unless you have a bunch of these towels so you can always have a dry one, it's not any better than the method I use now.I just don't get the point or value in using these towels and they're pretty small too. I don't know that it will ever be part of my normal car washing routine, but it's unlikely. It's a nice towel, so I might find some other use for it as some point.I can't recommend this to anyone for it's intended purpose. Just use some good soft bath towels and save your money.I normally use the smaller recharge kit (white bottle) but since i ran out, I bought this spray and the bigger oil can to match. I used it on a k&n filter I had never cleaned and unlike the other white bottle cleaner, it did not completely remove the oil, so it is hard to say I'm 100% satisfied. I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter. Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be, but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it won't be for a while. Since i don't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular (non synthetic) k&n filter cleaner, if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that. In this case the problem could be the filter, I have bought a few of the white recharge kits so I know how to clean filters. Time will tellI have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.
You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be.Very neat tool to remove battery post without twisting or jerking cables try to pull them out from battery .This tool also can be used to remove windshield wiper arms or other small job need to slowly easy to pull out the part. Good to have in tool box, special for mechanic use to replace battery when remove cables .
Very useful and precise. Even my mechanic asked me to order one for him. Beats opening the hood or even worse on my car, the battery is in the trunk under the floor. A pain to access if you have the optional rubber mat to protect the trunk floor.I purchased this to plug the receiver hole on my 2012 Rubicon when not in use.  It fits perfectly and I really like the strap that is made onto it.  It keeps you from having to store it away and then try to find it later whenever you need to use your receiver hitch.I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside.
I have a 2012 tundra and the mpgs were lower than the day i bought it. So i gave it a shot of this stuff and man it works. I bought a gallon at the recommendation of a friend who uses this stuff it will last me a year sin e i have two cars. You can use this with every fill up. The engine idles like knew and the mps increase by one mile. Thats an extra 25 miles to a tank.We have an emergency generator. About twice a year I fill gas cans to have available,just in case. I use the old fuel in our cars. Never a problem running the generator orvehicles. If you have higher than E10 gas switch it out 3 times a years. Sta-bil really works.I purchased a Groupon voucher for a $10 oil change. I figured the oil itself cost more than $10.I went to the local car care center (Nuno's Auto Care)with my voucher in hand. I was told, for your car there will be an extra $12 charge for the special oil filter. I told them "no way", and walked out.I went home and logged onto Amazon and found this genuine GM AC Delco filter and a spare plastic cap for less than $10. If the quality is good enough for a brand new car, it's good enough for my 3 year old Malibu. It fits perfectly. Yes, I also had to buy 5 quarts of oil, but I prefer to hand my money to a trustworthy retailer than pay a premium price for a non premium filter at a service center with questionable business practices.
This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Ordered this so we could do oil change jobs on our 2010 equinox.  Yes it works for the 2.4 as well as the 2.2 that its advertised for.  Does the job as intended.  Don't like the way chevy set up their filters but oh well what can you do.
I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust.I decided to try these out, and I'm glad I did! The black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame I also got from Amazon -REAL 100% CARBON FIBER LICENSE PLATE FRAME TAG COVER FFSince most plates only use two screws, one set covers front and rear (If you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required)The white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws, and the black cap just snaps over the top. Seems to hold well enough to not fall off, but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws. Another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware. That is good to know. I would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case. (Which isn't a bad idea anyway)These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72102 high tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.

The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway.
A little 1/2 ounce tube at the parts store was almost 5 bucks. this is great for exhaust manifold bolts and where heat and rust are a problem. Comes with an applicator brush attached to the cap. Can use on all bolts, never have to worry about breaking another bolt cause it welded itself to the thread. a must for auto enthusiasts.This is probably the 15th time I have bought a K&N; air filter. I have never had to replace one yet.Engines are big air pumps. It just makes sense to provide a really high quality in front of your engine as the first defense. The best part though.... Little to no air restriction. Even when it. Is dirty!  Also, I added about another 2.5 mpg to my fuel economy. That was just an added benefit. My old filter wasn't very dirty at all. This is the best $40 you will spend on your vehicle.I bought some of this to use in a car that I had installed a K&N intake on. It is a 3.8 liter 6 cylinder that does not have a supercharger, but the supercharged version requires premium fuel. After installing the intake and filter my car would ping using normal unleaded fuel. This fixed that problem in the first tank of gas. I then noticed I was getting considerably better gas mileage. I keep track pretty well on my gas mileage, it has increased range by about 10-15% on three cars, 1 motorcycle and cleans up the gunk in my lawnmower. This oil is very handy as an octane booster and engine cleaner. A cleaner engine runs more efficiently and then tends to get better gas mileage. One gallon will treat 400 gallons of fuel. Buy it by the gallon and save a lot over the 5.25 ounce bottles at truck stops. I will be using this from now on in all of my gas and diesel engines. This is not really being sold as a gas saver but that is an added benefit. Engines will last longer with this oil. The only thing that should be on the label or bottle is a scale for the number of ounces. I use the 5.25 ounce bottles to meter it into gas tanks and fill off of the gallon jug. Buy four gallons and you get a good price break on shipping for a full case. Get a friend to split the cost and you are set for the next 800 gallons of fuel.
I ordered 3 quarts of this to put in my manual transmission. Before putting this in, I drained the transmission, refilled it with very cheap 90 weight gear oil and drained it again to flush out any dirt or sludge. I let it drain overnight to get any residue out, and then I used these 3 quarts to fill my transmission.The car I put this in is a race-prepped 90's Toyota Celica with about 200,000 miles on it, but shifted like it had just come off the factory floor. We started out in a race, and less than 15 minutes into the race we started grinding between 1 and 2, and 2 and 3. Within the hour the grinding got to the point where it would randomly fall out of gear during the race, which meant that we had to hold it in gear for the remainder of our 14 hours of driving.When this started happening, we pulled over and looked at the fluid, it appeared fine, but we decided to drain it anyway. While we were draining it we noticed that the fluid visually varied in consistency and viscosity as it was flowing into our catch pan. We replaced this with cheap fluid, and the transmission started behaving better, but the damage had already been done. I don't know what caused this, but my assumption is that it had a reaction with the fluid residue still in the transmission after we drained it the first time.This Camco water filter works well on our pop-up camper and did make a noticeable difference in the taste of the water at the campground we stayed at. We forgot to replace our old filter and had to use the water straight out of the hookup on the first night, but picked up this filter at a local big box the next day. There was a marked improvement in the taste of the water when using this filter.We will replace this filter at the end of the season with a new one.Recommended!CFHThis is a good size to buy and is enough oil to service a filter several times. The K&N oil has red dye in it so you can see when you have achieved full coverage. Great filters that when maintained, one filter will last as long as the car will last. Catches dirt better than the paper filters. The K&N filter gave my truck a slight increase in acceleration. When I removed a new clean paper Fram filter and put the K&N in, I took it for a road test. On a dry asphalt road, straight line acceleration from a stop, my truck broke the tires loose every time. Put the Fram back in as a test and it was again not quite able to do it. Put the K&N back in and again it was able to break the tires loose every time. Never quite had enough power to do that before. Not a huge difference but a difference none the less. When you clean your K&N be sure NOT to use hot water while cleaning. Hot water can make the filter shrink in places, causing it to become uneven. After cleaning and recoating with the oil. Mine still looks just like a new one. I put the K&N in while the truck was almost brand new and now it has 234,000 miles on it in 13 years. Same air filter and the engine has never been apart. The engine absolutely has wear, but no smoke yet and still runs good.
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products.This is a great product. I use it once per year to clean my fuel system on a 1990 Camry. Still have the original fuel injectors. Do NOT use too much. Follow the directions on the bottle. If you use too much, it will deteriorate plastic and rubber parts in the fuel line. It will also make your car run rough. When I first used this years ago, i made that mistake and called Chevron. The technician at Chevron stated emphatically that you should NOT use more than is recommended on the bottle. In this case,. more is NOT better. When used as directed, it will keep your fuel system clean and your car running great. You can reach Chevron Technical support at 1.800.582.3835UPDATE: 7/7/14 - to the GM Truck owners with the fabric seats.  Be extremely careful cleaning these seats. I was removing a soda stain and the seat ripped during my second pass at cleaning. Note I was using a microfiber cloth, so be gentle when cleaning these type of seats. This is not anything negative about the product, just be careful on your cheap GM cloth seats.Those of you that have a Chevy truck and stuck with those light gray cloth seats, you will understand this review.  Found that to properly clean those cloth seats, do NOT use a carpet & fabric brush.  You will get uneven cleaning.  Instead, spray an even moderate mist on the entire sitting area, and wipe with a micro cloth.  It will not show the excess cleaner that looks like a stain on the seats when using the carpet brush.
Most people change their motor oil regularly, but forget about the transmission fluid. I have a few collectible cars. I only use Royal Purple products. They are fully synthetic, not a BLEND like some others, and they have a great web site where you can find the EXACT fluid for your car's transmission. so many people use the wrong fluids. The transmission should last as long as your engine. The wrong fluid or not changing the fluid will ruin your transmission. I have used syhthetic fluids on my Toyota Camry for twenty years. It's a 1990. Still the same engine and automatic transmission. I also use synthetic power steering and break fluid which I change every year. That's why I use it on my other cars as well. Just be sure to check their site to be sure you are using the right fluid for your vehicle. That is a MUST!Appears to be honda civic compatible. But after using Lubegard I have found a stark difference (better) with Lubegard. Lucas works but it slows down shifts (about a 2 seconds delay) and I had to gun the engine to get that power transfer up a hill or long shallow incline. Lubegard transfers power to the civic very quickly. I suspect that the reason is because lubegard is very thin and Lucas is too thick and tacky. Maybe it will work for you in a much more positive way, but not for me. I am surprised that other reviewers are saying that it makes shifting BETTER ???I will assume they never compared it to lubegard, so they would have known what smooth really is, like i did. OR perhaps it really shifts better based on the particular car make and degree of tranny damage; so in all fairness, I cannot knock those reviewers, but you can try lubegard. I stand by it; if you want smoother shifting (does not stop leaks if you have any !Conclusion: I deleted my initial review, in favor of lubegard. Lubegard is clearly a better product (but not all their other products are superior though). Lucas works so-so. I took off two stars after I found another product that works better. No, I do not work for them OR sell their products - I just love to tell people about great discoveries.I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.
This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know.
I've owned a black car for 25 years and keeping it clean and keeping swirls out for the paint is tough. So I bought another black car but this time I searched you tube for car care and found things about &#34;claying&#34; your car. I thought &#34;no way&#34; I'm going to rub a bar of clay on my black car, that would just scratch it to death. Well I was wrong, even after a good cleaning there is still dirt particles in the paint, just do the plastic bag test and you will see. I used the clay bar as instructed and it deep cleaned the surface and in turn I could seal the paint after the claying job. It does an amazing job on cleaning your paint. I have used it to remove scuff marks, bird doo, bugs, about anything that is on your paint.I bought this for use on my black 2007 Chrysler 300C. Prior to this purchase I was using the detailer that came with the Mejuiar's Detail Kit, which is in the red bottle. The main reason I chose this one is the sprayer on the other bottle seemed to be defective. After purchasing three bottles in a row and having them all be defective I decided to try something else. I liked the product, just not the quality of the spray bottle.I know that's a weird reason to change, but I am glad I did. This is a superior product to the basic detailer. It cost a bit more, but it's worth it - although cheaper on Amazon especially with Prime's free shipping.I mostly use this after washing my car to give it a nice shine. Before using this product I often used a quick wax spray occasionally between normal waxing and then the detailer spray to remove any smudging the wax left behind. Using this product I no longer use the quick wax. This detailer does the job on it's own. Using a soft cloth you spray it on, wipe it off and buff. Leaves a nice glow on the black paint with hardly no effort. Works well on a warm surface too. I don't mean in the sun, but like after driving and the hood is still warm.I have also used it for a quick clean when the car has only a slight coat of dust that can be wiped off with a soft cloth prior to using the detailer. I wax my car at least once or twice a month so there is always a good coat of wax on the surface. I would not recommend using the detailer without washing first if your wax is no longer beading up when it rains.All that said, this is not a replacement for a good wax or spray wax for that matter. This is a finishing product that should be used on a surface that already has a decent coat of wax. Great for bringing out the best in an already clean waxed surface.Oh and the sprayer works much better too.This was my first time claying my vehicle. I will say that it does what it says: I tried it on a small part of my car to test it out, and it certainly smoothes the rough, presumably contaminated surface. You can hear and feel the crunchy layer being lifted away, and the paint is returned to a like-new slickness. The process also seemed to make for a much nicer finish after waxing. Count me as another believer in the power of clay.If I were you, reading this review and wondering if this is the right purchase for your first-time claying (I must have spent several hours Googling and browsing Amazon for info; I know what you're going through), I would want to be told this: Buy a separate clay bar, and use soapy water for lubricant. Use the saved money to buy a nice bottle of car wash.At first I was hesitant to use soapy water instead of the detailer spray that came with it, but after some research I discovered that many professional detailers use soapy water (there are YouTube vids with professionals using soap suds for claying). I even did a test at first, using soapy water on one area and the detail spray on another, and the clay process worked just as well with soap (or auto shampoo, rather). Just be sure the water is very sudsy and constantly applied. I wound up using the Showtime spray to clay about half the car, and I nearly used up the entire bottle. Maybe I used too much, but I only sprayed enough to cover the surface (a 2010 Accord), and with something like this I figure too much lubricant is better than too little. Detailing spray isn't exactly expensive, but using the spray instead of soap could easily result in adding $5-$10 to the task. If it offered better performance over soapy water, that would be one thing, but it doesn't seem to.Before washing the car I tried using the spray alone as a detailer on a lightly dusty surface, and it cleaned well. I wish I had just used soapy water for the entire clay process and saved the detail spray for its original purpose. In that sense, this kit is probably a nice value along with the microfiber cloth (also pretty nice quality). I can't comment on the quality of the clay bar since it's the only one I've used. It was soft and didn't fall apart. I didn't see the huge amount of contaminants on the bar like you see in some customer photos (hardly any, really, but maybe my contaminants were of the transparent sort), but it definitely had an impact on surface smoothness.It was a good learning experience and good value considering everything it comes with. However, in the future I'll buy a separate clay bar. Mothers does sell the bar separately, also, and reviews seem to suggest its quality is competitive.

It works as described and was a good price.  This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.
Paired this up with Mobil 1 High Mileage Synthetic Oil 5w/30 that I also got off Amazon.  Using this in my Lexus GS400 with 135,000 miles and going strong. Prevents leaks that mosts standard synthetic oils will cause in older cars.I used this in conjunction with the E-Z Red Post Cleaner and the Road Power 989 Anti-Corrosion Washers. Of the purple mess sealants and gooey red sealants I have seen / used, this is by far the best I have seen / used.Super soft and I'd say zero possibility of scratching.  I bought a new black car and use these with Meguiar's black wax.  Does an excellent job.
What can I say, it installed and is functioning as a thermostat is designed to do. I did go from OEM 195 to this 180 but I won't get into the reasons as that doesn't pertain to the installation and function of this thermostat.Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara. Simple install. Does what it is suppose to do.Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged.It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.This stuff has a million uses in the garage and around the house/yard.  Any fastener that may rust, corrode, or otherwise lock up, just put a thin coat on the threads and don't worry...it'll come right off next time.  Use it on axle bolts, lug nuts, spark plugs, really any nut, bolt, screw, or anything exposed to the elements that you don't wan to seize.  And for the price, an 8oz bottle will last you for years!I used this on my vinyl deck where a protective pad for the grill had left a huge stain. The stain was removed with minimal effort. It also took some sticker residue off a plastic waste basket, the kind of residue that grabs dirt and dust if you can't get the entire label off cleanly the first time you peel it off; sometimes those labels just won't budge.Moving on, it removed a light dusting of latex paint (pale yellow) from a sealed hardwood floor, and also was handy for a pet stain on the wall (DO NOT ASK me about that stain. I'm still shuddering from the clean-up) and it also worked on the soot on the back of the glass over the fireplace.Summary: cleans evil dirt, smells divine. A must-have in my arsenal of home maintenance items.
Does a fine job. Only had to do it once last season.  We'll see how it works on a full seasonIt does a great job of hold a good charge and then turns off, and just senses the charge and turns back on  when battery starts loosing charge. would wreck amend this product for anybody that has anything that the battery will stay in over the winter or any kind of storage... MichaelI purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first.
I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket.You can't go wrong with these and should place them on all vehicle battery terminals after cleaning them. They are very easy to apply; red on positive, green on negative, between the battery and the terminal, on the post. Do this quickly as the car computer may require reprogramming if you do it too slow; if that happens it is easy to reprogram, just read your owners manual (it can alter window and door lock function). Before you start blow across the vents to dissipate and vapors that could explode with sparking, wear protective glasses and protective clothes (long sleeves) and wash your hands after.  The liquid in the cells is very acidic and will eat through clothes and skin. This is a good time to add distilled water to the vent holes. Do not top them off but bring the level to the bottom of the venting ring; leave space to vent the gases, there is a slot. Close the cell caps. Use a wire brush on dirty or corroded or fuzzy (usually a white or green powder) terminals and connectors.  Check your electrolyte, if you know how, to see if your battery is weak or has low/bad cells. If you have a lot of corrosion, cap the vents and mix about a tsp. of baking soda in a glass of water and brush it on with a toothbrush (if you get any in a cell it will kill the battery), it will foam up if there is acid, then rinse and dry before placing the washers and terminals. Remove the ground first, place the felt washer, replace the terminal, then place the positive. Reset your clock and anything with memory (GPS). Prepare for winter. If your battery is past the expiration date, replace it so you don't get stuck somewhere. Most good batteries do not live past their expiration date and can't be relied upon. Walmart and Costco batteries seem to be the most reliable according to reviews.This stuff has a million uses in the garage and around the house/yard.  Any fastener that may rust, corrode, or otherwise lock up, just put a thin coat on the threads and don't worry...it'll come right off next time.  Use it on axle bolts, lug nuts, spark plugs, really any nut, bolt, screw, or anything exposed to the elements that you don't wan to seize.  And for the price, an 8oz bottle will last you for years!
I have been washing all my cars for years with Turtle Wax Car Wash and have always been satisfied with this Turtle Wax products.When I bought this product, Turtle Wax ZIP CarWax, I was really disappointed about its wash performance :- the &#34;concentrate&#34; in the bottle is very watery to begin with; no comparison to Turtle Wax's original ZIP car wash- even though I used 1 fl. oz. (~ 30 ml) with a bucket of water this product does not generate any suds- because of this it is tough to get grime and dirt off; you have to scrub really hardI am baffled that this product has so many positive reviews; maybe Turtle wax recently has changed the formula for this product, and I got the newest version.I bought this item to use with my clay bar, this bottle is larger than the bottle that came with the Meguiars claybar kit. Works great...though I noticed the color of the product was diffrent from the smaller bottle from the Meguiars Clay bar kit. Both works the same...good price too.Pretty good product for quick detailing.As title says - waste of time, money and calories. I have 08 BMW 335i Sport. Silver color. Have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images. Spent almost an hour, tried all different techniques. This product simply doesn't work. If you have a new car with nice paint, I would avoid buying this. It might work for some old cars which paint is in different condition, but not for me - sorry.P.S: I bought a full set of Meguiar's paint care, you can find my reviews on other products as well. What actually worked for me (somewhat) is Ultimate Wax and Clay Kit (contaminant removal kit), Clay Kit is very hard to apply though, but it works.
The mk4 Beetles have a dashboard made of a ridiculous rubber/plastic material that gets sticky when the sun heats it up.  Why VW chose to use this material is beyond me, but I know that the mini california duster is the ONLY product I've found that can successfully clean the dust off of the dashboard.  It sounds trivial, but this is a really great product for the reason that it achieves what no other product can (or so I've found).It's an oil filter. It has been on for a few weeks now and hasn't come off, so I suppose it's working. It's hard for me to justify giving an oil filter a 5-star rating. What would the filter have to do to earn that? The only thing I noticed is that this one appears to be *SLIGHTLY* shorter, in length, than the one originally on my bike. I ride a 2008 Victory Kingpin and this was about 1/4 inch shorter. Hopefully, that doesn't mean that it isn't able to do the same amount of &#34;work.&#34; The rest of the fit was snug and seems to be just fine.Five stars for novelty.Five stars for convenience.One star for being a necessity.I really like this product. It is very neat to pop what appears to be a large white tablet out of a bubble pack and add water, then watch it grow into a thick  wet paper towel. You can use it to clean up spills by putting the tablet on the spill and using it to absorb the liquid as it turns into a paper towel. This product has the consistency more of a very thick paper towel than a cloth. It is paper and reminds me of the old paper towels called Job Squad of the late eighties and early nineties that were monster thick and could handle any paper towel job or spill. The first time I used one I thought "Wow this product is neat, it is like something from Star Trek or the Jetsons". It is literally a tablet that turns into a small "cloth", you simply add liquid and unfold it. If you have a real need for keeping a small conveniently dry paper towel stored some where to use later this is an excellent product. The problem is, I can not think of any real situations where you can not just keep a roll of paper towels or a cloth. This product might be useful for hunters, fisherman, or boaters because they can be put in a pocket to use later as needed. They would also be great to use by outdoors men if it is raining and impractical to have paper towels. It may just be I have a lack of imagination for its uses since I am a home body. The product is great if you really need it. But in most situations a roll of paper towels will do the trick.
Nice tight fit on my camper van.  Since I have a composting toilet and don't use the black water tank, I leave this cap on all the time and use a 6' standard hose for the gray water.  Highly recommended.I have a brushed titanium finish bike with polished aluminum components, and this polish works well on both metals.I also used it to polish the brushed stainless steel exhaust tips on my car, with very good results.I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons.
I have a 1998 Ram pickup that spends its entire life outside, parked near trees.  I hadn't done much with paint care for more than a couple years and one side was covered in small, hard, brown tree sap spots.  Reading the reviews on Amazon (and other websites) for clay bars and their use in cleaning up paint surfaces, I thought I'd try this Mother's kit to revitalize my paint job.  I was sceptical about its abilities to do anything other than a final "fine cleaning".  I was right.The clay bar could not remove any of the hard tree sap marks.  It does not remove scratches (and can actually apply some if you do not keep the clay lubricated.  It does make the paint seem smoother to the touch, but I cannot tell the difference between a final normally waxed and polished surface and a clayed waxed and polished surface.  The surface feel of unpolished paint Vs clayed paint does exhibit a noticeable benefit from claying, as the makers claim.  However, applying a good polish achieves the same results on a washed and clean paint surface, in my opinion.  Even on my truck, after cleaning it first, the clay stayed pretty clean and only after doing the whole vehicle paint surface did the clay feel faintly gritty and appear slightly darker in color - ready for trashing.To remove the sap, I resorted to a rag soaked in mineral spirits and plenty of elbow grease.  To eliminate any light scratches, I used T-Cut.  Then I clayed it, followed by polishing with Turtle Wax.  After a day of that, my shoulders ached bad, but the truck paintwork looks good; well, as good as an 11 year old, well-used, stone-chipped and scratched truck can.  The clearcoat has actually held up exceedingly well over the years.I haven't tried clay on our 3 year old, garaged minivan yet.  It will be interesting to see if it removes minor swirl marks.  I don't expect it to make the paint look any shinier after polishing. It looks great as it is.I did buy an extra bottle of detailing spray (I bought the kit locally at Autozone) in case one wasn't enough.  But one was enough for one clay bar / one vehicle treatment.  Since there are two clay bars in the kit, then the extra bottle will be used with the second bar.I found the claying to be easy and quite quick.  I split the bar in two, then pressed it flat into a disc about 2" in diameter.  Then I sprayed the surface and rubbed the clay back and forth over the paint in my palm.  Knead it regularly back into the 2" disc, as it gets thinner and splits.  It was actually very straightforward and no big deal.  Avoid rubber parts, like the windshield surround, as the clay picked up black "soot" from those.  Make sure you polish it dry as the spray leaves streaks if you don't remove it with the supplied towelI suggest clay bars are really for the guys and gals that want the ultimate care for their newer vehicles.  It may not be noticed by anyone else, but it's the satisfaction of a job well done that always matters to the perfectionist!  I know 'cos I am one!Sept 26 2009 UPDATE:  This evening, I tried claying half the hood of my minivan then waxing it all to see if I could tell any difference.  The clearcoat on the van is in great condition.  I washed the hood and dried it.  Then I clayed the left half (LH as seated in the van).  I did notice that even with plenty of spray lubricant there were a few faint straight line, light scratches visible in the clearcoat after I wiped the surface dry that weren't there before claying.  I could not feel any real difference in the surface smoothness from the clayed to the unclayed side. The clay appeared to have no visible dirt in it.  I then Turtle Wax'd the whole hood.  After that, the straight line scratches were gone and there was no VISUAL difference from clayed to unclayed even with the reflected overhead flourescent light from my garage as a guide.  I then applied my dry finger tips to the hood; left hand on the unclayed side and right hand on the clayed side.  Applying a light pressure and sliding back and forth, I think I detected a slight reduction in friction as the fingers change direction on the clayed side.  Even swapping hands over, the result seemed the same, ruling out differences in my finger tips!  However, the effect was so slight that it was almost imperceptible.CONCLUSION:  Claying may help with a contaminated paint surface to remove those last little imperfections and revive the paint, but with a clean and regularly-waxed paint surface, claying probably isn't worth the cost nor the effort.The meguiar's hot shine high gloss tire spray is not impressive. When I spray the tire shine on my tires, I find myself having to go back after about 5 minutes and wipe it down with a towel because it leaves drip lines down the tire.  Kind of like if you put too much paint onto something and it leaves runs.  The consistency is equivelent to regular grade milk,  It is not a gel consistency.  Another issue I ran into is, I will let the spray dry on the tires for approximately 30-1 hour and I still notice that it shoots up on the side of my car makings spots on my rear bumper and front doors after driving.  I like using the gel type of tire shine better, that you brush on.  It flows on better without leaving streaks or runs and it sticks better to the tires, not the side of your car.  One last thing I noticed is when I spray the tire shine on my tires, it leaves a dark crescent shape on my driveway that lasts for months.  Not a big deal, but it angers me that it sticks better to my black asphalt driveway than my tires.I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface.  Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...This does indeed store plastic bags - a few. It is small enough to fit on the inside of cabinet doors on my RV but it really doesn't hold many bags and leads to the obvious question - &#34;Why spend the money?&#34;. However it does work as advertised.Nope did not keep out the bad guys as they tore it apart.  The steel coil, sold elsewhere, that is inserted into the filler tube does work and is cheap to boot.
What can I say, It does what it says. Just make sure to keep it upright. If its on its side or upside down it will leak slightly. Not sure why someone would put it in that position but just a heads up. Cant beat the price on Amazon. Especially if you have prime !Will work great for what I bought it for.Haven't used it yet and will post if it turns out to be a pos.i recommend it to everyone who has a hi lift jack or something like, to buy this product. it fits very snug, hard to fall off. it does exactly what it is suppose to.

The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.Works good, installed on my 2012 Kaw Voyager 1700. I installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box. Use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work, sound awesome too.Bought these for my Vette.  The length of the ramp is not sufficient to get the car on and off without using wood extensions.  Getting on is OK, but getting off without the wood slipping and crashing the bumper is a real trick.  Have to bore a small hole in the wood and a small hole in the ramp to "lock the wood extension into place" to avoid slippage.Other than that, they work.
I drive an older SUV that has a lot of plastic on the outside. The plastic trim had lost it's color and looked sun damaged and pretty terrible. At first, "back to black" didn't sound like what I needed, since the plastic I needed to treat was grey, not black. But, I read about this stuff on another website, and it can be used for all sorts of plastics/vinyls etc., not just black color. Anyway, this stuff really works. My car is looking much better now. I did the first coat and it is looking very good. I'll follow up with another coat soon, and hopefully it will look even better!I spent a pretty penny on this item and used it on my Lexus IS300 white metallic pearl color.  I don't see what the hub-bub is about.  What am I missing?  It's okay.  It's not terrible, but is the price justifiable?  I don't know yet.The tool is a quality item that is well constructed and looks like it will last a lifetime. I have absolutely no complaint with the quality or construction but did note that the tool I received did not match the picture that should not be allowed for online sellers. My handle was grey in color instead of the advertised red. This does not detract from the tool's performance but I do find it unusual that Lilse would choose a dull color such as grey instead of a bright color that stands out. The grey acts as a camouflage if you drop it or set it down in your engine compartment making it hard to see and fish out from behind your firewall especially in poor lighting. The tool was a lot bigger than what I was expecting but that was actually something I liked. This tool will not help with all electrical connectors on every make and model due to the many different designs but is a welcome addition to my tool chest. Would definitely buy again if needed but would select the easier to see red handled version if I had the choice.
No streaks, goes on easy and comes off clean.  Microfiber towels to wipe off the excess, leaving your car's glass spotless.  Highly recommended.Read the reviews and had to try for myself on my new car.  Works GREAT!  Easy on, Easy off. Great protection, water just beads off. Can apply in hot sun, easy buff off to hi-quality shine. So easy, you don't mind applying again later for added protection(2nd coat). When dirty, rinse car with waterhose(if water doesn't bead up, time to apply Liquid Glass again, usually last more than 2months) and dry off with microfiber clothes.I use S100 12005L Total Cycle Cleaner Bottle on my Chopper, great product.  Make sure bike is cool, spray on then rinse off with high pressure, gets majority of grime off bike.
The SG does all it's advertisd to do very well. Using the programable functions requires some effort. I'm glad I have it but haven't gone much beyond basics.The quality of this tool is very good and it hasn't fallen apart or given me any issues yet.If it does I will update my review accordingly.My only regret is that it's not made in the USA.This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...
Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc.This is my go-to wax for 2 of my cars.  In essence, it is &#34;oily&#34; or at least it leaves the car looking wet.  Take note however that on a black car, this wax will actually attract dust.  It does look excellent for a few days but then I notice how the general dust seems to get settled more easily.  I use another Meguiar&#8217;s product for my black car now.  On my red and blue vehicles I stick to this wax.  Elbow grease comments?  Yeah only if you have done NO prep work on the vehicle before application.Couple things to upgrade any good detail job (I&#8217;m referring to the one and two star folks)&#8212;washing, drying, and throwing wax on a car will never bring out a showroom shine unless the car is new.  Washing, drying, and prepping the entire vehicle with a product like Meg&#8217;s fine-cut and in some cases medium cut cleaner is the ticket.  You can take out so so soooo many scratches, swirls, and debris that way.  Stay clear of &#8220;rubbing compound&#8221;&#8212;better yet leave it in the 80&#8217;s.  After you have used fine cut and the car almost looks polished already (remember you need to use a variable speed polisher&#8212;you cannot use this stuff with elbow grease), go over it with your clay bar just to make sure.  The vehicle should be smooth&#8212;no bumps, pits, etc.  If so, start with the fine-cut again and level it out.  Understand the Medium-cut, Fine-cut, and Rubbing Compound are all abrasives.  Think liquid sand paper with Rubbing Compound being the harshest next to actual sand paper.  Finally go ahead and use the wax.  Only apply it to small areas and then wipe right off with a microfiber towel.  I literately give the area 30 seconds to a minute to dry.  DO NOT wait for the wax to dry.  Follow the directions and don&#8217;t apply so much that you can&#8217;t get it off before it dries.Use only microfiber towels&#8212;don&#8217;t fool yourself with anything else.  Never ever ever ever apply wax in the sun.  Do it under cover, in a garage, or in the morning/evening only.  Hot car means hot sticky dry wax---check the metal and see if it&#8217;s too warm.I used this product in conjunction with an appropriate primer and clearcoat, all from VHT, to paint my car's brake calipers bright glossy red.step 1) remove brake dust, grease, and rust using a brake caliper cleaning agent of some kind.  Also use a wire brush if you can.step 2) Sand your calipers using 320-grit sandpaper.  Really rough them up.  Then use some more brake cleaner.step 3) Mask off your car's corner  body panels, the wheel wells, the struts and hoses, and finally, the brake rotors.  Take the time to mask the bleed valves on the calipers too.step 4) Apply primer to the caliper in a very light, speckled coat, then move to the next caliper until you've applied a coat to all 4.  Do this 4 times, gradually getting heavier, but avoid letting the paint run (it's okay if it happens in the primer).  Try to do this as quickly as possible.step 5) Apply your base color (THIS PRODUCT) using the same method as in step 4: light coats multiple times.  I suggest a sweeping method, rather than just spraying hard.  Do NOT allow the base color to run.step 6) Apply a clear coat using the same method as in steps 4 and 5, but be careful not to overdo it.  Clear coats can run more easily than base colors.  The paint should be looking thick and glossy by this time.step 7) Wait an hour. Drink a beer or something.step 8) Remove your masking.  Gaze upon your new calipers.  Then, use some brake cleaner to remove any overspray from the brake rotors or undercarriage areas.  Do NOT use brake cleaner to clean body panels, as it will probably remove the paint.step 9) put your wheels back on.  wait a few more hours.  THEN drive your car pretty hard, making sure to go fast, and brake hard.  This will heat your brakes up.  The paint needs to cure at 200F, which means you need to drive and brake repeatedly.  Don't go too nuts.That's it!  All finished.
I had mixed feeling about this stuff. I sprayed it on rubber seal as directed ( can says very little about product or direction) It foams on the turns to a liquid . Then it starts to run and drip on RV and eventually dries. It did not stain Rv but it was messy as foam turned to liquid.It works like any spray on tire shine on the market you spray on tires. In fact that's what I did with what was left over with 2/3 a can left used it on tires. It went on the turned to liquid and dried to a nice shinny, non sticky clear coating on the RV tires and my cars. I don't know if it will hold up as long or maybe longer then the tire spray I can buy for 4 .00 a can verse this stuff at 12.00 only time will tell. It claims that it has UV inhibitors so that's a good thing to keep tires on RV from cracking from sun. If it lasts a long time on tires then this will last even longer on  rubber seals on Rv and I will change it to  5 stars, But time will only tell!I am hopping it eliminates that annoying rubber squeaking on slide out  when the motorhome is driving down the road and is why I tried it anyway.Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc.I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products.
What a load of crap. I just installed it in my 2000 civic and I did not see any REAL noticeable benefit.After all the hype about increased mileage, increased fuel economy, quicker starts, etc, etc. I have yetto clearly perceive any real benefits from using it. I paid a arm and leg for it and cannot realize itsbenefits. For civic owners you can continue using the regular NGK plugs, just change them every 8 monthsand you are good to go. I will not waste any more money on snake-oil plugs like this. I will revert to usingthe regular plugs after I have exhausted using the iridiums (since I already bought them, might as well use them).If you are going to wax your vehicle (which you should about twice a year in a cool spot in the shade) you should evaluate the clear and if it has a lot of swirl marks you should consider polishing the car and then waxing it. I like to do the mothers three step process polish, micro polish, and wax but i still had some of this so i used this as step one.Not sure what this stuff is or why it works, but it does. I had a 1986 Honda Shadow that had a hard time starting up, and it would randomly choke out and die sometimes. Mechanic said I might need a carb job (super expensive, you have to dismantle the bike). I threw in some Seafoam (full can into an empty tank, just before refueling). Bike ran like new. HOW?Lots of other people have given dozens of incredible uses for Seafoam too, so I'm sure it will serve many other purposes as well.
This gas cap does an admirable job of both containing the fuel within the tank and venting off excess vapor pressure.It is brand new and AC Delco branded. It comes with a tether as shown in the picture. It is a perfect fit.Not much else to say about it.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...
Easy install. Once I got to take it to the dump site I ran it with the clear 45* angle so I could see what was coming out. In the first few minutes I was getting lots of tp and stuff. I closed up the valve and ran it for about 5 more minutes and the opened the valve and got lots more. Did this about ten times before it was almost clean. Now this rv is only about two years old. I'm the second owner but don't think the first one used it all that much. So for it to get out that much stuff stuck in the black tank, I'm a happy camper.I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. After removing the cap I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap that came with the cap, see my other review. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. This rotor was a PITA to remove! Due to the lousy cap, the rotor was rusted on and had to be cut off. Even after installing the new one, I tried to remove it just out of curiosity and it was very hard to remove. I've never had this problem with OEM parts. I won't buy this rotor or the matching cap again.Having bought a ten year old car that has very low miles and basically all the original fluid and parts. I felt it was time to do maintence  mostly because of the age. Popped it in within few minutes. Have had no issues. Can't mention on any improvements yet but had good luck with k&n before.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.Installed on a motorcycle works great.  Cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging.  Great price.
I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.I use it for all required applications. A friend that builds engines for a living uses it everywhere it can be.  I have never had a failure of this product.I saw this product recommended on another forum.  Having used Meguiars products over the years I figured I would give this one a shot.  It works well in between full polish / waxings or cleaning up the paint with a clay bar.  Recommend.
Seems to work well on lighter colored leather. Note that this leather cleaner AND conditioner both discolor plastic slightly. With that in mind, as long as you're careful the conditioner makes a leather wrapped steering wheel feel great. Also tested it on a beige leather couch, the cleaner and conditioner worked nicely.For black leather (larger surfaces than a steering wheel) the conditioner proved to be a little harder to use- it left streaks unless the entire area the product is applied to is coated pretty well.Not bad, I'd probably use it again.This is very handy to have around the house.  Works on any glass surface and truly makes it look invisible.  Just spray and wipe away in straight lines with a towel.  Works well on car windows too, and is safe to use on tinted windows.Lately, there seems no difference between polishing compound/rubbing compound. The latter used to refer to very coarse material but this no longer seems true.I use this compound mostly on plastics and it can remove residual adhesive, scratches, etc... It can also be used to polish clear coat layer on metallic paint. Paint whatever with metallic paint first, then spray a few layers of clear paint (gloss). Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth. You'd be happy with the result.
I use this in our travel trailer. It's a good fit on the counter, but the stand needs to be a bit taller to be able to slope the water toward the sink, so I end up propping the end up a bit. I don't use it for storing since it's an open grate on the bottom and don't want to chance spilling any detergent or soap during transit.I purchased this for a small RV modification. My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.  I have used these before for water hoses, and though it says &#34;electric cable hatch&#34; it will work fine for a standard RV freshwater hose too.Bought this to use with an air compressor. I didn't want to risk shorting out a fuse using the compressor in the cigarette lighter in the car.
I have had no problems with the functional use of this connector.  I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.  If you can't find Safari Charlie, I'd recommend trying an electrical contact cleaner or conductive contact grease like what is used on trailer harness connectors.  Any auto parts store should have those.You know those expensive "headlight restoration" kits you can get?  Well, you can actually use an abrasive polish (like this one) and achieve much the same result.  I use masking tape around the edges of my headlights, then use an orbital polisher with a firm pad to polish my headlights using this compound.  It's very adept at removing that thin layer of yellowish oxidation which makes headlights more opaque than clear.  Best of all, this bottle has a lot of compound in it and you could polish your headlights probably 75 times on one bottle before running out.So there is that... but it's also good on paint.Over the years I have found the best use of a rubbing compound is to either restore heavily oxidized finishes (with no clearcoat), or to remove paint/scuff deposits on a small area of your car.Be advised that this is a very abrasive compound and you should NOT use this as a general purpose polish for a newer car finish.  Every time you use this product you remove a tiny layer from your car's finish.  Remember that and use with caution.  If someone bumps into your new car in the parking lot and left a paint scuff, this is the ideal product to get it off with.  If you have an old car that's been sitting out in the sun too long and has faded a bit, you can use this product on the entire car to bring it back to its near-original shine by removing that layer of oxidation which makes it look dull.So whether you own a new car or old one, this is a great product to keep in the garage for detailing days.I had an older version of this with a rough surface that trapped dirt constantly.  Impossible to clean.  But this one is shiny black powder-coated metal, and its way better.  Fit the oven in my Ragen 2003 27T Toyhauler perfectly.
I received the valve on time and it was very well packaged. I have installed the valve and it works very well on my RV hot water tank.I needed this to move my front mounted winch out from the bumper. It did the job very nicely just as I had hoped it would. I feel pretty sure that it will hold up as I use it for winching. It would probably work fine for towing as well but I haven't used it for that.Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks.
The K&N HP oil filters are the model of K&N with the 1&#34; nut on the end so that you don't need an oil filter wrench. If you're a DIY person you will appreciate being able to tighten/loosen this in a small space  where it is very hard to get a standard oil filter wrench of any kind. All you need is a 1&#34; wrench. This particular size fits my Miata and the filter is squeezed into a tiny engine cavity where access is very limited. This filter is a breeze to install or remove from above the car. The K&N brand is made by the same company that makes Mobil1 oil filters and that is as good as it gets. I highly recommend this filter for Miata owners and I recommend K&N HP (with the nut) and PS (without the nut) for all vehicles. The quality is excellent and Amazon has the best prices.The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.This item appears to be the same as what you'd get from the dealer, only at a fraction of the price.  personally, i like the baking soda odor neutralizing ones better, but this is good also.

This is great for motorcycle batteries. If you are charging a car battery, I'd look for one of the more powerful battery tenders. This is great for any motorcycle, atv, jet ski, etc that sits outside, as the unit is waterproof. I have been using this charger for over 3 years and it has never failed me.I used this on a two stroke gas engine head gasket that was blown. I had my doubts, but has been fine for that job.This item was delivered when promised, was well packaged, and is a good value. This is a must have for your garage. The battery has plenty of battery power, is long lasting, re-charges in a reasonable time, and has a quiet air compressor that has been used so far, to replenish a few of my cars tires.
This rain suit is awesome for the money iam a motorcycle safety instructor and this is the kinda of product i recommend new students purchase its made great and can be seen in the rainAlthough it should be included for free with the Jack this item is a must have and reasonably priced.  Careful it's also easily stolen.Title says it all.  This puller works well for what is is designed to do...pull seals.  Good tool to have for your shop.
Before you purchase this, please make sure you do a little reseach about Rain X products.  They can leave a film on your windshield if you don't use it regularly. I've used the product before and it works great, but you have to be dedicated to using it all the time moving forward.depending on how much you use your travel trailer/RV i replace mine every year. easy to remove and reinstall new one. I use white nylon tape just in case for no leaksOnce you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it.
After reading the reviews and what each had to say about this disconnect switch, I purchased two. One for the engine battery and the other for the coach batteries in my RV.  The mounting bracket is "hefty". With the mounting hardware, it was a breeze installing these two switches. It is well worth the price just for the mounting bracket alone. Sturdy is the word I use for the switch. The only negative comment would be that I wish the key can be removed after engaging the switch. Yea, I know some would say it will keep you from forgetting the disconnect and take the key with you. I just prefer to have the ability to remove the key after the switch has been engaged.  Just me.I have a 2002 Subaru Outback and this filter works great. The K&N nut is so handy to remove the filter, I would not go with any other filter anymore.I have had this cap wrench for 20 years, I first bought it for my 1993 Tercel. It worked on the metal canister oil filters of the Tercel and it also works on my 2012 Camry 4 cyl as well. I cannot understand the large number of reviews stating that this wrench broke - how tight are the oil filters they are removing??? I cannot imagine this one breaking if the oil filter is installed properly. The only complaint I have is it sticks to the filter housing (both the metal filter of the 1993 Tercel and plastic housing on the 2012 Camry) so you have to rock it back and forth with your ratchet to get it off.
I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.
I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM!I bought this tool on a whim, since it's fairly cheap, preparing to replace the rear brake pads on my 2003 Beetle 1.8t.  None of the sides had the correct spacing to retract the caliper piston.  I rented a kit from an auto parts store beforehand to be safe and needed it in the end.That said, I am going to keep this tool for future cars.The valve looks good but I ended up returning it as it wouldnt work for the way I needed to hook this into my RV's water system. Application was for a 2012 Keystone Cougar 327RES.
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellThere are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.

Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid...Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
Bought this to use with electrical connections on a tail light assembly for a cargo carrier.  It works as described and was a good price.  This a small tube, so it will only do a few jobs before your run out.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?

Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.
Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well.I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work.This polish really does a beautiful job on virtually any metal.I would guess I've been using this polish for over 30 yearsand have found there's pretty much no end to what this polish is good for.It gives a gleaming shine on:Brass ~ silver ~ copper ~ gold ~ chrome ~ aluminum ~ pewter ~ stainless steel ~ and more.It's not good on many painted nor plated surfaces as it may remove paint & plating.I can say from experience that it ruins/removes the gold or silver flashing on china.I use this on so many things that I keep tubes of simichrome in the house & garage for convenience.Plus carry it in both the car & truck as it's proven to be very use-full when antiquing.Especially for checking if an item is Bakelite.The pink polish will turn a yellowish (dark yellow to a canary) if it's Bakelite ~no matter what color of Bakelite your testing.The polish will stay pink if it's not Bakelite.While cleaning our un-hearted garage this past fall I found a particle tube behind a cabinetthat must have been there for over 20 years ~ and it was still fresh & worked like new!Freezing doesn't damage it, I leave it in the garage & autos years around.This polish leaves a protective finish so metals don't darken again as quickly ~while adding a beautiful shine.
Love the smell of this product and the low spotting residue left on the car. Make sure to wash in shadeI use S100 12005L Total Cycle Cleaner Bottle on my Chopper, great product.  Make sure bike is cool, spray on then rinse off with high pressure, gets majority of grime off bike.I used this on the front carpet in the car.The stuff works.. It removed &#34;ALL&#34; whatlooked like permanent stains with 2 applicationsone on top of the other.
Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5.Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.I bought this on another persons review and wasn't dissapointed works great hint let completely dry and use a thin coat. Completely apply to complete vehicle then buff with orbital or using micro finer towel you wont be dissapointed
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.
I have had no problems with the functional use of this connector.  I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.  If you can't find Safari Charlie, I'd recommend trying an electrical contact cleaner or conductive contact grease like what is used on trailer harness connectors.  Any auto parts store should have those.I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products.I was impressed with the power of this little unit which I use to blow out water from around lights, the honeycomb grill, crevices, and other hard or impossible places to reach by hand after washing my car.  I then finish the dry process using a MF towel sprayed with Optimum Instant Detailer to get fantastic results with no spots.  Just be aware you must use an extension cord with this blower as the built-in cord is extremely short.
I used this pad with the Porter Cable buffer and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5" PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar's Ultra Finishing Polish and it worked great. This pad is easy to clean.I would recommend these towels.We use them, and microfiber is one towelthat won't put scratches and swirl marks in a paints finish.All microfiber works well but low price towels may notresult in the best quality product.If you buy cheap you get cheap, and my car deserves the best.Show Car Guys 3 - Pack Of Ultra Blue Plush Microfiber Towels 16" x 16 "- At 360 GSM, This Is One Of Our Best Microfiber Cleaning Cloths-It Has Ultra Plush Micro Fiber Material On One Side, And The Other Side Consists Of Medium Terry Microfiber Material.Highly recommended for the ultimate car cleaning kit.I use these products regularly.Add microfiber towels and you have the ultimate shine.Complete Microfiber Towels Car Kit - 2 All Purpose Microfiber Towels - 1 Microfiber Towel For Streak Free Glass- For Home Or Auto - 2 Ultra Plush 16 by 24 Microfiber Auto Detailing Towels - 1 Auto Dust Pad For Home Or Auto
If you ever used a short stubby wrench that came with your car, you would wish for one of these. I have one for each of my cars, and one for the garage. With this wrench the amount of leverage you can get even with one hand/arm is great. Totally worth it for the price. I just suggest people get a torque wrench as I can see people over-tighten some lugs with this thing...that's not a good thing either.Buy it, it will pay for itself the first time you ever have to use itIf you wash your car with a bucket, there is no reason why you should not have one of these at the bottom of your &#34;dirty water&#34; bucket! If you don&#34;t know what I am talking about then move on this isn't for You!Just what it is - brass drain plug.  Normal quality as you would buy in a hardware store if you could find this configuration for this specific purpose.

That is why I only use their products.it does take a little skill to make sure you dont let it land on any other surface (besides the one your trying to remove 3m from) but honestly it works great. i would recommend this glue remover to anyone who wants to remove decals from there car or remove the glue left over when removed.No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.
I used this to seal paint on an old corvette painted 16 years ago that was still in good shape. I polished the finish first and used this as final step to seal/protect finish. I used an electric polishing wheel to apply this and removed after about 15 minutes or so as recommended with a microfiber cloth by hand. I think I have used just about every wax and polish ever made and am happy with the glossy shine this sealer leaves. also when removing this it doesnt leave any dust or powder residue like most waxes do. I cant attest to how long shine lasts yet since I just applied this product today.This unit works well.  I used the supplied foam mounting tape and overnight the unit fell off the wall.  I remounted it with 3M foam tape and it has not moved in several months.  I would not mount it over a vehicle using any type of mounting tape.I used this pad to applyMeguiar's M10532 Ultra Cut CompoundandMeguiar's M20532 Ultra Finishing PolishusingMeguiar's G110v2 Professional Dual Action Polisher.The pad stayed on the polisher (hooks and loops system) and followed contours of my car's body well.  I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Ultra Cut Compound and before using Ultra Finishing Polish.  I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad.  The pad did not fly off.I am very satisfied with this pad.
These are lightweight universal mats--nothing special.  I use them on top of the OEM mats in my car to protect the OEM mats.I purchased some much thicker microfibre towels, as these ones just aren't thick enough to soak up sufficient water. These are now relegated to cleaning the windows and wiping down the interiorThese applicators work perfectly and clean up easily. Whether using them for interior leather or surface wax application, they do not mar the surfaces and spread whatever coat of Meguiar's you're using evenly and safely.
this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going.OK, this is a somewhat dumb product and should come with the wheel locks for free, but it doesn't.  Oddly, right after I bought this I found the exact same bag on the street with a Honda symbol on it.If you're a neat freak like me, you'll like this product and be willing to pay for it.  Otherwise just pay $0.50 for a little nylon bag at a Dollar store.  Or look around the on the street, apparently people are dropping them.This is great oil - there's no debating that. Compared to normal prices in auto stores, this is a good deal as it gets the oil to your door for less than retail's 7.99 or so/quart.  That said, autozone and pep boys currently both have - and regularly have deals of 5  quarts plus a mobil 1 filter for $31...you do the math ;)
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
If you care about your vehicles finish, you should use one or two of these for your 2 bucket wash.These do not have the stackable banana plugs as pictured from Amazon.com.  You need to view the customer's pictures to see how these look.The build quality is cheap.  The quality of the wires itself is not as flexible as DMM test leads.  I use these on a bench power supply.  I will never use these on a DMM.If you plan on using these on a DMM, I would highly recommend you buy some Fluke test leads.No matter what you use, a great variety of tools and car maintenance items, Bosch is a premium brand you can rely on to do the best job possible. And, if you buy at the right time, great rebates may be an added bonus.
A great product for those who stay in areas / condos where a water hose may not be available. Can be used as a clay lubricant and quick detailer in higher concentration. If your vehicle does not have lot of grime and mud etc which needs to be hosed off this is an ideal product to get. Good for regular cleaning between waxing. Does not strip off wax or sealant. Great water saver. Keep a few microfiber towels handy to dry the vehicle, take care to rinse clean the cloth as you work.It finally warmed up enough to apply this stuff.  It works poorly on my older rear window. I will try again applying it after washing the glass with ammonia. Sometimes a high pH surface allows the coating to stick better.  One  off for quality, one off for price.Mothers makes great products. This is by far the best wheel cleaner I have ever used. Just spray, let sit for 30 sec. and wash off dirt and grime. BUT you do have to use a wheel brush to get off excess dirt which is not a problem.
We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.These are great bulbs and work well as promised.Do keep in mind that Sylvania has several of these halogen bulbs and claims all kinds of brightness improvement over cheap bulbs.  The only difference is the color coating of the glass.  They use the same wattage as the cheap ones as required for H11.  If you want brighter then hack higher wattage bulbs (as I have done in the past) that are somewhat socket compatible or upgrade to HID.I never used these before but I will use them again. they are different than most which have the grooves or ridges on them that line up with grooves in the pullys. These are very quiet and fit perfectly.
Until you use it you can not comment on it.Others have told me it works great for getting a flat fixed until you can make it to a repair shop.I have never had a flat or needed to use anything like this before.But wanted it for my Harley Sportster.  Better to have it than call a tow truck....oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now.I know that nothing is theft proof. All we can do is make it as inconvenient for the thief as possible, so maybe he will move on to an easier target.This lock would not be easily opened with hand tools... a torch or grinder would probably be required, making the attempted theft a bit obvious from the showers of sparks.The round style keys are much harder to pick than a traditional tumbler method.So far, I haven't found any faults with this device... but I will update later in the summer when it has had some use.
This is a neet product. Well made. Non-slip coating on the handles. It is expandable just like a pair of pliers. Should work very nicely the next time I change an oil filter.Push it on the stem and you have an accurate pressure.  Milton is a quality product.  This straight chuck works great on duals.  Beats those small gauges.Great product that works well.  I use this base to support the front wheel of my boat trailer.  It has effectively done its job over the past month, there is not an indentation in my driveway from the the front wheel.  The plastic is very sturdy and I am very happy with the purchase.
i used on rear brake shoe replacement.  It goes on easily without fuss or mess.  Hopefully it performs as expected.Using a little Permatex Dielectric grease on the spark plug connectors will help remove them later as well as sealing out moisture.Pad works as described.  I used it along with M105 to remove swirls marks on my black Tundra.  Product dries quickly so work a small section at a time.
I think this is a terrific article at an acceptable price.An ice scraper needs not be anything fancy, this is truly all I need.It's sta-bil how can it be wrong and this is the best price I could find. I am very happy.What can we say about this thermostat? It is a Stant. Arguably, the best thermostat available for cars. It was priced right and processed/delivered promptly.
The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was "lost" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O. No explaination was given when I contacted the company. Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance. My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra. The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota's optional "tow package". Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long. The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way. Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal. If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake. If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good..These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil.The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico.
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.
If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug.I wanted an air compressor to keep my car tires inflated proper. This one does the job.  You can set it and it will turn off when the tire has the proper PSI. I use an air gauge to check behind it. Yes, it has a short AC cable but most everybody has an extension cord in their garage and if the cord was longer the unit would not be compact. The DC cord is long enough. A good buy
This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project.And because of this fact, I use this product. If you frequent non Tier One fuel suppliers, as many of us occasionally do, you should regularly use this or a similar product to insure that your fuel system is kept clean, lubricated and properly functioning. Certain automotive industry professionals and automotive industry publications suggest that a steady diet of economy gasoline will ultimately result in costly repairs due to dirty or contaminated fuel delivery systems. So, to minimize the incidence of expensive repairs such as fuel pump and fuel injector replacement, I use this product with which I'm very happy.
I like using this mitt - I use it for waxing not washing... It's not great for initially working in wax - you can't beat a good microfiber cloth for that, but for a solid once over afterwards, this is a great mitt.Found this dangerous for my 29' Airstream.  It's fine for level parking, but don't use this on sloping grades.  Trust me on this one.  For smaller, lighter campers I'm sure this would be ideal.Good meter for the money, got this on a lightening deal. Its no Fluke but for basic trouble shooting its plenty good enough. I use it alot.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
One down side, bottles can and will fell off due to the fact of the design. Adjustable arms cannot hold a &#34;full heavy&#34; 16oz water bottle ...... those arms spread easier than a _________ legs.I actually got'em glue with epoxy using a coke bottle as standard measure; be careful not to glue'em to wide apart or the lid wont close.these are pretty handy when troubleshooting, can free up a hand so you don't have to hold both leads to what ever you are checking.What can I say?  Great replacement to those broken latches for your cargo doors, a must to keep in your parts drawer
I finally broke down an procured this item when installing my privacy fence. The job started out that was going to hand coat each board before install with sealer. After a few boards I decided that I have more important things going on in my life.With this I could lay out MANY boards and coat them quickly. Clean up was a easy task as well. This is designed well, gives great even coverage.My house needs painted so as soon as I get some time I can't wait to see performance of this product for that task. I will try to report the results when I am completed.I am very hopeful the Meguiar's NAME will make the product a 5 star AFTER I use it.  Hope to avoid getting scratches on my paint until then:)this is an excellent final coat wax for your car.  In my case I use the Meguiar's NXT polish,  wait several hours to let it cure, then apply this wax.  I use it on my car that has color (my other car is white).  Be aware, it is harder to buff this.  I maintain my cars by hand and became tired thei first time I used it.  (I washed, clayed, hand compounded, then did 2 coats of wax).  The next car I did I paced myself and washed/ compounded one day.  Then the next day I polished and waxed the car.
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLIt's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it.Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!
If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations, this is it. If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it. Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt. Its going to shine. Great automotive or household maintenance product.Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function.This unit is a new experience in loading and retreiving items from the bed of my pickup. It also makes it easier to was the top of my truck. I would buy it again( that is, if this one ever broke or got lost), which isn't likely ,since it is very durably made.
I've been using this filter for the 12 years that I've owned my Camry, and have been using Fram filters long before that.  It works just like it should; as far as I know this is the best filter on the market.  The sandpaper-like grip has me committed to this brand.  It allows me to change the filter on my car without any tools, and I cannot exaggerate the convenience of that one feature alone.Some people have commented on the quality of the filter based on what it looks like on the inside.  While it's a natural tenancy to judge products by the way they look, I wouldn't give it much value.  The only way to properly judge an oil filter is to run lots of dirty oil through it and see if it does its job.  Consumer Reports did this a long, long time ago and Fram came out on top.  I'm sure the product has changed since then, and I'm not aware of more recent studies.  All I can say is that I've used this brand for more than a decade and have never had any problems with the filter.I also bought and tried the S100 brand and it does not apply as well as this one does. The spray on this product is a lot finer and it goes a long way. I used this on my Road King on the black engine krinkle finish and it made it look like new. I have washed the bike a few times since and the black still loooks great. I think I will be using this product from now on. I plan on using it under the hood of my truck also. Highly recommended!It's the second time, I've used this product on my Mitsubishi Eclipse v6 5sp. I highly recommend it for everyone to use it.
This was a bit loose on my grease gun, and a bit awkward to get fastened. An OK product, not exciting but serviceable. It does allow hanging the grease gun with some placement precision.Nu Finish liquid polish makes your car really shine. It goes on easily and smoothly, and is a breeze to wipe off. It only takes a dab of product, to cover a large area. The end result is a glossy  and long lasting shine. It claims to be once a year polish, however it applies so easily that I use it at least three times a year. The rain water beads nicely for quite some time.I like this mitt because it will soak up a ton of water. The fabric isn't bad on the paint either. My only complaint is the stitching is a bit shoddy at the tip but my wife whipped it closed within a second on the sewing machine.
When washing or polishing cars, bikes, or chrome microfiber rags work the best. I use them for waxing and buffing paint and they work great. I ust to use terry cloth, the old school way. Terry cloth still left some scratches in the paint, but wasn't that bad. Microfiber just seems to do a better job all the way around.Car need a good cleanup to shine?  Use this.  I have a black Lexus and when used, its amazing how much of the hairline scratches go away and how deep and glossy the black ends up.  Use their Ultimate Compound first and follow with this.  It will make the shine and depth come out even more.  Looks like it just came out of a paint shop, has that &#34;wet&#34; look.  Impressed.My brakes look really good even after a winter here in Germany. It's important to prepare the calipers thoroughly before painting or the paint may start to peel prematurely I believe. I followed the directions and all seems good. I used a couple of coats to make sure it covered all the calipers and it looked more shiny too. My brakes are pretty dusty, so they get dirty easily and I have to clean them quite often. The brakes on my GTI don't seem to get as dusty and they are factory painted, but I don't think the paint has anything to do with it. It was also enough paint to probably do 2-3 cars easily. 2 coats each.
I really like this charger. You can select the settings for normal, deep cycle, and AMG batteries. You can select small or large batteries. You can set the reading to watch between volt reading or % of charge. Great product for the money!Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.
These are a whole lot better than my stock nozzle. Will spray a fan of fluid, it is adjustable and comes with the adjuster key, silver thing in the picture.The only thing I wish was different was being able to adjust the spray higher than what the limit is at now. It is just barely clearing the whipper blade, but the stock one had been so clogged that is wasn't getting above it at all.It is on a ball type adjustment, so all angles and such, just the angle of my hood is the issue, overall, way better and even spread.The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a "vanity" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.
Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust.  Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid.  Will update with results.It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletNice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.
After reading all the various reviews on this, I knew I was taking a risk on the purchase but decided to roll the dice to see if it was my lucky day.First of all, I did not purchase this through anyone currently listed as a seller on Amazon, but the source is a very popular tool supplier that is listed for many other tools on amazon.  The priced was only about $4.00 more than the best listed.The mityvac arrived inside a sturdy shipping box that originated from Mityvac. Inside this box, the 7201 was nested inside its own box with a protective card board sleeve over the top of the handle. It arrived undamaged.Per the supplied instructions, I checked the screws in the upper lid to ensure they were tight (they were). I'm not sure if it came with a gasket under the lid that so many had stated was missing on some units. It worked, so why bother with taking the lid off.I tested the evaucation action by drawing a gallon of antifreeze inside the 7201. It did this quickly with only a few pumps of the handle. So far so good.Next, I tested the refilling capability by returning the antifreeze back into the one gallon container.  It did this quickly and very throughly leaving only about 1 oz in the botton of the reservoir.  Very very good.The supplied tubing is very rigid and I plan to replace it with some flexible hose from a local hardware store.I give this a 5 star rating.  Sturdy and well made.I shopped around on the internet, and Amazon clearly had the lowest price on this battery (50 dollars cheaper than buying in town - even with a coupon).  I was worried, though, after reading about so many issues with the batteries being delivered damaged or smashed.  Not mine.  Mine was in the original Optima box with HUGE styrofoam protectors surrounding the battery.  The box was extra thick cardboard.  Not only that, but UPS delivered the battery and the box was perfect - really - no dents, no signs of being dropped or mishandled.  And, even better yet is the battery was fresh stock - manufactured in the same month and year that I placed the order.  I am a very happy customer on this purchase.  BTW, when the battery arrived I checked it with my DVM and the voltage was about 12.8 VDC.  I installed it and the car cranked right up!  You can check out my video on how to change this battery on a Suzuki Grand Vitara on YouTube at watch?v=ppqJdzyMZxM&list;=UUSZgIbvZItJr78kHY3Y9wnA&index;=5Update:  after just a bit over a year since installation, the negative terminal started leaking acid.  I wrote to Optima and included my Amazon receipt.  Optima notified Amazon directly to issue me a full refund.  I have used and loved Optima batteries for many years, but feel their quality may have suffered when they moved assembly to Mexico.  I have switched to Odyssey.I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. When removing the existing one I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. The matching rotor was a PITA to remove, which I will explain in the rotor review. I won't buy this or the rotor again.
Second one I have bought... That should tell You this is the best Jeep hitch for the money... Extended is the greatest for trailering with outside spare...  Giddy-Up.Probably the best in oil filters around, kn builds great products and this is not the exception; if you care for the best for your lovely car, this is your oil filter (see application list for your car)A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...
does the job.It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!It does what it is supposed to and suds up.
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.On certain fastener applications, where there is vibration and on rubber bushings, this is a must. make sure you are tightening the bolts to ther correct torque specifications.If you are still using an old test light the power probe will change your life for the better!! Works great...has crazy long leads. Has a switch that lets you use the probe as a power or ground source. Even has a digital volt meter.
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.I've been using this product for years. It works.1800 degree rating, it can be used on exhaust manifolds (think - exhaust gas temp probe on your diesel), and any bolt that is in a high-temp environment. If you don't need that high-temp rating, there are cheaper products from Permatex that work for that.A little goes a long way, for the average garage-guy this jar will last for years.
Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...this is a great product does everything it says.this fixed my drain hose problems and kept the waste water flowing.
Wanted to change the fuel filter out and only use ACDelco on the truck when I can grab one. The install of this filter is easy but be forewarned, you will get some gas on you so be sure to use gloves and something to catch anything that spills from the fuel lines. Install usually takes less than 30 minutes and be sure to use FUEL/BRAKE line wrenches on this because you can easily round off the fuel line fittings. Thanks Amazon for carrying ACDelco, it helps me avoid picking these up from the dealership.A snap to install, and easily transferred from one vehicle to another. I couldn't believe all the information that you can get off of the car's computer system.I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway.

After using a star lug wrench for many years, I decided to try the Gorilla telescoping power wrench and I am impressed by the additional power that this wrench seems to have.  There is absolutely more torque with this wrench and I am able to remove lug nuts with less effort than the star wrench that I have used for years.The Gorilla wrench can expand to provide additional leverage needed to remove even the most difficult lug nuts attached to your wheels. The telescoping feature snaps into place and I found that in order to reduce it back to it's normal storing size you must depress the recessed spring button and slightly turn the wrench.  You then just simply push the wrench against a hard surface such as the ground in order to collapse the wrench back to it's compact size. Two additional sockets are included as well as a protective plastic case to store your wrench.  The Gorilla wrench is heavy and is of sound construction and I am very pleased with this purchase.Look good installed and heavy duty steel to protect tailight.Only problem is they mount with the screws that hold the lens in the light housing if hit hard its still going to break the tailight lens and maybe the plastic housing as well.If you decide to replace the spark plugs, as I did in my '01 Suburban, the old wires will be very difficult to remove. The Suburban is 12 years old and the the spark plug wires appeared to be the original. The coil ends were easy to remove. The ends on the spark plugs were not, and i damage a couple of the wires trying different techniques of removal. The vehicle had 160k miles and they needed to be upgraded with OEM quality. These are the right wires and the vehicle runs so much better with the spark plug tune up.
As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.While BMW claims the differential oil is a &#34;lifetime&#34; fill, replacing the oil periodically (30 to 50,000 mile intervals) will prolong the life of the drivetrain.  And the Red Line product is the best there is.The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.
I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed.
I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting. Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70% which is nice and after full charge at 100% the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that's where it stops working like others have reported...came back to the battery after two days and the battery isn't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52%. The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked. It only seems to charge and not maintain so It's being returned to Amazon.Don't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update. Amazon replace charger and was quick about it...but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund. Done with this brand.Bought this in May 2012.I usually carry jumper cables in my car, but not anymore. Jumper cables: you should get a set longer than your vehicle, so you don't have to back it out of a parking spot first. Then with the longer cables, you should get the heaviest gauge wire you can or you lose power through the cables. Then of course you'll need someone with a car or truck to help you!!Solution: Booster PacI really like this battery pack compared to others.1) no unnecessary gadgets like a flashlight, air compressor or 110V AC inverter. While these are handy to have they usually are of poor quality when combined in a package like this.2) Size is great and easier to carry. While all these jumper battery packs are heavy, this one is relatively narrow in width making it easier to carry at your side with arm extended.3) Takes up little room in your trunk and can be locked up with a bicycle cable lock.4) Can be charged by your auto's 12V adapter. You have to monitor the battery's green "Charge complete" LED  because there is no automatic shutoff when the charged through the 12V outlet. This means you can overcharge it and reduce it's life and capacity.5) Use it as a power source to recharge your phone or iPad etc.Maintenance notes:Be careful using this as a power supply. The BATTERY is designed to deliver peak power to start your car. It is not designed to deliver continuous power like a car battery or battery back up.For longest battery life recharge as soon as possible after each use and at least once a month.Avoid discharging it to 50% or less as this will eventually decrease power output. Recharge as soon as possible after each use to extend it's useful lifeCons:Only 1: I don't like the AC charger. The brick gets hot and stays hot even when the charge is complete. Must be an old style transformer electric vampire.CHARGING OPTION:I recently bought a modern battery charger/maintainer for the car to top off my car battery and maintain the charge when the car sits. These chargers are not expensive for the lower current models.(about $20 on up)Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerModern chargers are designed to gently charge your battery especially from 80% to full. This charge method will extend the life of your battery and give you maximum amps when you need it. When your battery is full, they go into a Float/monitor mode.I used my new battery charger on this Booster Pac and had great results. I tested the battery Pac with a professional 100Amp battery and alternator tester. The Booster Pac tested  well within the good range which was better than charge with the supplied AC adapter.NOTE: you can use a motorcycle/car battery charger through the Booster Pac jump cables or 12V accessory plug. Both work.Fortunately I have not needed to jump a car since I bought this unit in May 2012.Would definitely buy this again.Took off 1 star for the AC charger that gets hot during and stays hot after the battery is charged. It is a potential fire hazard and wastes energy.Whenever a car cannot be started, it's always either 1) the battery is low, 2) battery is bad, or 3) alternator is bad. Tough to always bring the car in and pay one hour labor for test. Even if some places offer free battery test, it's still a hassle with multiple cars that have lots of electronics in it.This tool is great to check for battery charge level (voltage level), so it's possible to preempt some "can't start the car" problems. It can check if alternator is bad (not charging) while car is being driven. I've also got couple of jump-starters with gel packs with DC sockets, and couple of spare batteries. This is great to go around to check all batteries, used or not, to be always full. (I attach a DC socket to battery terminal adapter to test spare car batteries)
This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?Almost nothing to it, mass wise, has an adhesive disc on the back approximately 1.5" across, slightly off-center.  The actual mirror part thought seems to be silvered plastic (no surprise), but arrived with what appears to be scuffing directly from the packaging itself.  As long as there isn't a light source in the reflection, it's barely noticeable, but it's there.
It is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy againDon't buy this unit. Buy Camco 39062 RV Dual Flush Pro Holding Tank Rinser with Gate Valve instead.  This unit will let you back flush but guess what happens when you want to disconnect the hose.I guess it's only good for connecting a hose for extending the drain...Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.
I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged.I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice.  Very easy to useMy first battery load tester and I like it so far. It's clear and precise with the voltage, load and charging readings.The only problem is that I feel that the cables are far too short as you have to bend downwards with the tester when it's connected to the car battery for testing.One last thing, do not touch the back part of this testing when you're doing a load test. It get's freaking hot! It get's so hard that one might get 2nd degree burns if you aren't too careful.
I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.what more can I say? These work great, I have four. Best price I can get is here on Amazon, $2-6 more in the store. The lights tell you if it's charged, almost charged, or being charged.Have never had an issue with it over-charging.I keep it plugged in 24/7.The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV's.  Not so, not even close.  There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work.  Was a total waste of money.  I've had RV's for over 40+ years, and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit.  Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost.  Would not recommend this product to anyone. To bad you have even give it one star, in order to leave a review
I'd never heard of this until I saw it in my search history. This product works great!  You don't really need to buy it from Amazon because it's cheap regardless for what it does, but just happened to be a good add on to my order.  One thing to be aware of is that it does NOT dry clear or anything.I purchased the JNC300XL for my wife, because she has a habit of leaving some load "on" and drain her battery.  I was attracted to this product because, (1) it was ranked well on amazon, (2) it does have lots a solid reviews, and (3) it was small and not too heavy for my wife.  Before purchasing this product, I was spectacle of the "900 Peak Amp" rating.  I researched all of the internet to try to find any battery specs that comes inside this so-called jump starter.  When it arrived I tried it on a friends sedan.  Connected it up, turned over the car, and nothing.  I took the JNC300XL back home and opened it up to check the battery.  It is an 8ah battery inside. To be frank, I am not a battery expert, but how can a 8ah battery delivery 800 peak amps? I reassembled the JNC300XL and connected it back up it my friends car, and left it connected for several hours (~2-3 hours), and it did eventually work. If you are purchasing this as a jumper starter for emergency situations, I think you will be disappointed.  If you just need something to boost your battery, and time is not an issue, it works just fine.  I just think the product description is misleading.  It should say battery booster, not jump starter.I have one of these that I use in one of my older cars.  Works great.  I had gotten it at Wal-Mart.  Fast forward, I wanted to get another, so I went to Wal-Mart to try to pick one up.  They didnt have it, just a store brand unit.  Wow, what a piece of junk.  LCD was poor, would flicker because the refresh rate was not right, had one less decimal place to look at, etc.  It was a complete disappointment, considering that at Wal-Mart prices, it was $1.50 higher than the Equus here at Amazon.  I returned it and was super-glad that I could find this one here on Amazon.  I have it in service and it is absolutely great.  It works well, works correctly and is accurate.  It has two units past the decimal place, not just one (the picture shows 12.6 as the reading but it would actually give you 12.63, as an example).This is the unit to get, you cannot go wrong.  My only desire for improvement would be if the color of the LCD could be varied from just green to maybe red as well.
It does the trick - easy to use and not only gives the OBD2 code but also the name for the code so you have some idea of the problem before you research it.When I followed the web link through the software for more information, it asked for VIN and License numbers and had some 15+ diagnostic questions.  I was expecting a more complete analysis after going through all that, but found it wanted $9.95 for a more comprehensive report that would include possible causes and troubleshooting info, which you can find on other web sites through search engines.I would have liked the product to include a concise Quick-start guide, and for the users manual to include a list of codes and brief descriptions.  I didn't find the documentation to be user-friendly.If all you want is a tool to read the code, this is the tool for you.  To make the results useful, you'll need to research the code on the internet.I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.

Get it.  Save money.Very good purchase for the money. Very good quality and worth what I paid. Like I said in the title, it's huge. I can get the zippers to about 2 inches apart with a 3X motocross helmet with the visor attached. If I take the visor off, it has plenty of room to spare. I don't think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag.I use an &#34;AFX FX-17 size 3X&#34; sold here on Amazon, if you want to see what visor I'm talking about.I like that once my helmet, goggles and gloves are dry I can store them all in this bag.
Bought these to hold food in place in the frige in the Camper.  I know I will not regret this purchse because I will not have messes to clean up when we travel in our camper.This works well so I can keep my unit inside the garage yet hook up my vehicle when there is no room to park it inside . I have to batteries in a camper van . I used to have to crawl under and hook it up in winter meaning it didn't always get done . With the proper disconnects attached it is no longer a difficult thing to do . Just make sure the leads can't rub on anything .I bought these some time ago.I use them mainly to detail my vehicles, cleaning glass is great, just don't use too much glass spray and your windows will turn up crystal clear.I use them "dry" to dust my dash/ door handle, etc...though you can use a quick spritz of some interior detail spray to make it even better.Keep a few in the car incase the windows fog up, these worked great.And you can use in the house as well.....things you can wipe down are only limited to your imagination.
Great set of levels make getting level at campground a snap. Graduated markings tell you how many inches you are off.  Good adhesive backing eliminates need to drill holes.Super easy to install and with the ability to pivit 90 degrees so it saves you a ton of cranking.  With the dock chock you will not have to worry about your boat trailer.If you want to help your cooling system be more efficent,Then this product is what you need. 1oz per quart of cooling system . And watch the temp drop. Must have for better cooling.
i have been using these filters on my bike that i occasionaly take to the track i do about 4000 miles a month and i can say this really is a better filter.if you buy at WlMrt(sorry I can't put the name of amazon will remove the review) this stuff really works, I have a 2010 Toyota Corolla and it has a gauge on the odometer area that says how much estimated MPG I get and I was using convectional Oil, when I put this Mobil 1 fuel economy in my car, my MPG went up by 0.5 MPG so know I was only getting 29 MPG now I am getting 29.5 MPG, thats still good, it's the same price as the other Mobil 1 when you buy at WLMRT, you will save money in the long run using this, I recommend it to every one.What can i say.  It holds oil.  Multiple oil changes before I have to take it to empty it.  Some people complained about the cap.  Its not the greatest cap in the world, but its ok.  I only use this in my home garage for 2 vehicle oil changes.  Its not that big of a deal for how seldom I use it.  If you are a professional mechanic then you probably have a better solution to hold used oil.
No problems with the oil, but what makes it so much better then regular mobile 1 full synthetic ?Why is this extended performance so much better ?Does that mean i can change oil less frequent ?For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two.What can I say?  I read several reviews on-line about oil filters.  The Bosch PREMIUM gets good reviews.  It's priced right.  It's slightly larger than the OEM on the Honda Fit - a good thing.  It fit perfectly.  It wont break the bank.  I ordered 2 for the next scheduled 10,000 mile oil changes.  No kidding.  The wife's 2012 Honda Fit just got 10,000 miles on the original oil before the driver's &#34;oil minder&#34; said it was due.I'm running this filter with Mobil One Advanced Synthetic of the manual recommended grade of 0W-20.FWIW, for over 4 decades I have heard so many arguments about what oil and what filter to use and people get really heated about it.  Let me tell you that age old piece of advice that still holds true today.  When it comes to engine life, it is more about changing the oil & filter when required and not so much about what oil or filter you use.  Not that there are not valid arguments that if you use a certain oil or filter you can expect longer engine life.  I'm sure that's true.  But no, much simpler than that.  When trying to figure for yourself what oil and filter to use, ask yourself when was the last time you wore out an engine.  Most folks replace cars every 4 years.  I've personally owned one I bought new for over 20 years (130K miles) and another for over 15 (135K miles) and another for 250K miles (don't remember the years).  I changed the oil & filter religiously on all at 5000 mile intervals.  I used anything from premium filters to Walmart Tech filters and oil to premium synthetic oil & filters.  None of them EVER had an engine problem.  The cars around those engines fall apart eventually.  That's my point.  So many people think that they have to use this or that so that they can get the most life from a car that they themselves will be replacing in about 4 years anyhow.  They don't even give themselves a chance to wear it out.So....  Change the oil & filter regularly and with what is recommended by the manufacturer.  &#34;Meet the specs&#34; and worry not.  Just my 2 cents.
strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.I haven't driven on these yet. I'm sure they will work fine once I do. They seem pretty well made (in China) and from the reviews will give me the traction I need.I have mounted the non-defective one on a wheel and installation is as easy as they say. The chains are coated in some kind of material that gets all over your hands, which is why they give you gloves I suppose. But, the gloves are too flimsy to last; keep a pair of cheap work gloves in the container.The rubber tensioner is probably the most difficult part of the installation; it takes some strength, particularly in the wrists, to stretch it enough the last 2 clips. But, it makes for a very snug secure installation.The reason for the 3 stars is that one of the two 'chains' had a cable twisted around itself, rendering it useless. I'll have to send it back.Advice to anyone who buys these things (or any chains); put them on the vehicle as soon as you get them and well before you will need them. They may be defective, as mine were.But also, you don't want to be figuring out how they are supposed to be mounted when you're hip-deep in snow or stuck on the side of a road with other vehicles slip-sliding your way.The plastic container has finicky hinges and clasp; a different model of this chain comes in a bag instead of a plastic box; you may want to consider getting that one instead.To stress what other reviewers have said, when you order this "2 Pack" you get what you see in the picture: two chocks, not two sets of chocks.This is a good light-duty set of chocks. They are lightweight, made of durable plastic, and are stackable (like they are in the picture) to save space. They are also bright orange so you don't forget about them when the job is done.The bottom of the chock is slightly serrated, which will give it a decent grip on concrete and asphalt - just make sure you wedge them in well. I would not use these chocks on an incline, on a soft or uneven surface or on a vehicle with a bad parking brake, but for all your normal uses these should do the trick.The two chocks come attached with a plastic fastener. It's a boar to remove, so a pair of pliers is recommended. If you look closely at the picture, you can see holes pre-molded into the lower end of the chock. If you want to keep the two connected but still easily separated for use, I recommend a short length of twine.
Was great to attach to my spare battery so as to attach heated wear or any thing that I wish to take away from the trike that requires 12 volts.Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them)..
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.I haven't used this product much, but I do want to warn people that there is an indentation in the bottom (up front) for this chock to fit on one of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler).  This is good because if the tire is sitting on one of the levelers that this chock is integrated in, the chock won't move.  I suppose that you could still use this chock without one of their levelers, but it won't sit flat on the ground due to that indentation mentioned above.  If your RV doesn't need a leveler, then using this chock may not work as designed.  You may want to consider one of the chocks that doesn't require a leveler to use (Camco 44492 RV Super Wheel Chock).  I'll update this post when I get more experience with them (it comes in a set of two chocks).I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.

Get it.  Save money.
Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3.My Lincoln used to start well, run rough for a few seconds, and kill. After the second or third try, it would run perfectly. It turned out to be a fuel delivery problem. The problem was a dirty or partially plugged fuel filter that restricted fuel to the injectors until the fuel pump had run for a few seconds. On most Fords that use this filter, the big Crown Vics, the Mercury whatever, and the Lincoln Town Car, the fuel filter is located under the car on the passenger side in a special bracket attached to the frame of the car. It is up on the inside of the frame ahead of the right rear wheel. As far as I know, Ford uses two types of &#34;quick connectors&#34; to attach the fuel lines to the filter. Either type is simple. You can find a &#34;how to install&#34; video on You Tube. This maintenance part is probably the first place to look if you suspect a fuel delivery problem. This part is genuine Motorcraft, it came promptly at a good price, installed and fit perfectly, and resolved the starting problems on my Lincoln.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!
Bought this because of all the reviews, but it did not work for me.  My Harley uses an AGM battery, and found out after the purchase that this charger cannot charge an AGM battery.  For a simple battery maintainer, this product is big and heavy.  I expected more.The size is deceiving. I got this for my dad who was kind of used to those heavy metal-cased chargers that need special care not to destroy the battery. The nice thing about these CTEK chargers are that they are &#34;smart&#34; and require no special treatment. It really is idiot proof: just plug and play.And I can attest to the &#34;reconditioning&#34; feature. It will NOT resurrect a totally dead battery, but if you have an old battery that's marginal (meaning it is borderline: may or may not start your car/tractor/whatever), it will make it better! We tested this on a marginal tractor battery. It only started if it felt like it before, but after reconditioning it was significantly better.The only feature I wish it had was a &#34;boost&#34; feature. But any charger with a useful boost feature of any use has to be a really large one so it would be impossible to fit that feature in this form factor. A spare battery is better than any &#34;boost&#34; feature anyways. You'd be better off keeping a spare battery sitting around to jump start your vehicles. I kept my old car battery, reconditioned it and leave it charged in my garage for that purpose.I have a 1967 Ford truck that can be quite a drain on the battery at times, especially during the colder months. I purchased this before last winter, and never once had an issue with the battery being too low or too cold, despite some pretty frigid temps. I set this on a shelf just in front of and above my truck, and leave the lead to the charger hanging. I then wired the battery end to my battery and channeled it so the plug end can be pulled through the grill. It's nearly invisible when it's not in use, but is very quick and easy to plug up. I've gotten used to just plugging up the truck every time I'm done with it, and this little puppy brings it up to full charge fairly quickly!Highly recommended, especially if you have an older car that either doesn't get driven much or is a heavy drain on the battery.**********************************************************************************Update 01/02/11:Unfortunately, I sold my '67 truck back in the late summer of 2010. However, this little battery tender was still going strong, so I immediately hooked it up to my 4-wheeler. It has been doing a great job keeping the battery on it charged up through some especially cold weather we've had. So after @3years of use, I still give it 5-stars. Awesome product!Update 11/19/12: I noticed something really smelling in my garage, and spent quite a while trying to find it. It was a horrible "ozone" like smell, but clearly was the smell of burning electronics. When I got to my Battery Tender, I noticed the light was no longer on and it smelled really bad, so I immediately unplugged it. I'm not quite sure what happened, but am a little concerned about this. That said, I will consider replacing it as I still believe it's a good product.Update 02/19/13: As these units carry a 10-year limited warranty (if you have your receipt), I decided to send it in. The cost of mailing it was around $9 for standard post, and $11 for Priority Mail. The warranty replacement charge is $12.95 (why not just $13?). So in total, it will cost me just under $25. That is, assuming they replace it, which I certainly hope they will! I will post follow-up later.Update 03/20/13: It took approximately 2 weeks, but Deltran DID replace my charger under warranty. The thing is, the replacement charger - which appears to be brand new, and not refurbished - did not come with ANY paperwork. No "we're sorry for your inconvenience" letter, no receipt, no packing slip... nothing. So my warranty on the replacement will only be as good as the remainder of what I had left on my original 10 years (approx 4 years). The inconvenience of the return was frustrating, and I'd have liked at least an acknowledgement of that from Deltran, but it "is what it is". Hopefully this new one holds up at least as long as the first.
Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.If Monster cable could only see the copper inside this jacket.  Normally when you cut a piece of heavy cable in the center and strip back the insulation you see nice shiny copper.  Granted the ends may be oxidized a bit but they are open to the air - I cut this at the halfway point to make 2 shorter cable sets or 4 equal cable pieces. This cable, while being nice and flexible, looked like an old penny inside - heavily oxidized and ugly as sin.  I suspect its reclaimed copper 2 times over without proper slag removal.  That's the only reason I took away one star.Also the crimp lugs supplied leave a tad to be desired, but they include some properly sized red and black heatshrink.  You are supposed to put the stripped cable into the lugs then fold each half over the other with "electricians pliers" - My professional crimper was able to fold them but not close them tight on the wire, so out came the persuader - a 16 oz claw hammer and some cement.  Yep - that closed the crimp nice and snug on the wire.  Now it has a good snug grip.  I did buy some professional #4 lugs at the hardware store made of copper like a shiny penny and my professional crimper did those justice, so their lugs are a tad sub par but you can put them on with just about anything.  Alternately I could have hit it with a propane torch and fed some solder to it, which I may still do if there is excessive loss in the cable.  I prefer soldered connections wherever possible.I also bought some nice bolt on attachments at the hardware store for $2/pr that have a bar which snugs down with 2 ea 7/16 bolts and nuts on the back side.  Now that was a solid connection - I drove the bolts home with my dewalt 3/8" impact driver and a 7/16 socket which grabbed the wire and would not let go, then gave me a big ring to tie to that did not look like someone pounded a crimp lug with a hammer on cement to make it grab!I realize copper is expensive these days but this stuff was recycled 2 or 3 times over.  New copper wire shouldn't look like a 1960's penny under the couch.  It sure makes monster cable's oxygen free copper look bright and shiny by comparison. On the other hand, I did especially like the fact that the insulation is color coded properly, red and black.  I have seen high current wiring kits where the wire's insulation is entirely black, entirely white, or some other way of not coding the positive and negative by insulation color.  Even the space shuttle wiring is ENTIRELY white no matter what purpose it serves.  The only identification each white wire gets is a black wrapper with a 4 or 5 digit number that is referenced in the schematics.  Nasa's wire is also silver plated copper and thus carries the same current of cruddy copper wire 1 size larger with the same loss and less weight at 10x the price.Other than the cruddy copper - it's a good value - you're getting 20 feet of #4 cable with precrimped lugs on one end and trimmable to length on the other end with a set of lugs you can pound onto the wire.  It certainly has the heft of 20 feet of #4 too - this shipped at over 5 lbs, most of which was the 2 pieces of #4 cable.  It ran my inverter just fine so no harm.You also get a green ground wire to tie your inverter chassis to whatever ground you have, be it in a car or a ground rod in the earth.  Like me you probably don't think you need a ground for a battery powered device - when wwas the last time you grounded your remote control?  In theory ground wires should cary no current nor any voltage, but the spinning fan on the inverter can cause static electricity.  You do need to equalize any static charge buildup or leakage in capacitors, or alternately stray magnetic fields causing voltage in metalic parts.  Sure these are small voltages, between 0.5 and 2.0 V but they can flip a logic state if not returned to ground and also making troubleshooting a nuisance.  While not absolutely necessary, if you don't ground it be sure that somewhere from the output path of the inverter to your load you have a GFCI plug.  That way if the current finds another path back to the battery or to the inverter chassis it will cut off power in a fraction of a second preventing electrocution - yours, not to mention damage to the equipment.Keep in mind that #4 wire can carry 100's of amps (approaching 1000 amps) and will do a nice job arc welding.  Once you get this installed treat it with a great deal of respect.  Don't be shocked (no pun intended) when you make the final connection if there is a SMALL arc - emphasis on SMALL - the reason is that there are capacitors in the inverters that help to smooth out the current flow and they charge instantly when power is applied. When finished, disconnect from the battery.  Use some extra caution when using tools like crecent wrenches around  deep cycle batteries =  don't bridge to the other terminal.  I had an electrician drop a crescent wrench inside a pac bell phone central office onto the -48VDC buss bars that powered the building's phone switch.  It didn't even blow the fuse - just vaporized the wrench into sputter.  We crawled down to the buss bars and there was nothing even resembling a wrench where it made contact with the -48VDC bars.  This product box even has a warning that if you are not familiar with high current wiring have someone who is do it.
My experience with Slime has been limited to bicycle tires, where the product does a good job sealing up pinhole and other small punctures in the tire tube.  I have never used Slime in an automobile tire, but since the materials are basically the same, I would assume that the product would work in a similar way.For an automobile, where the flat occurs makes a big difference.  If your car is parked and notice your tire is flat, this kit would probably be quite useful.  You can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is.  If it is a fast leak, you can try using the Slime and see if it takes care of the problem.  The car does not need to be jacked up to use the product.If the puncture happens when the car is being driven, the problem is more serious.  When you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat, most times you will do heavy duty damage, or tear the tire.  If that happens, Slime won't help.  The tire will need to be replaced.  The instructions state that Slime will not work on punctures greater than 1/4 inch.  So basically, Slime is intended to address only minor tire damage.The Smart Spair kit is a pretty good deal.  It consists of a 16 ounce bottle of slime, and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet.  According to the label, a 16 ounce bottle, should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire.  The 16 ounce bottle is available at Amazon for about nine dollars.  Subtract this cost from the price of the kit, and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars, which is not a bad deal.  The compressor has a pressure valve, ten foot cord, and on/off switch.  It is pretty noisy, and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate.  It is rated for use on a minimum 15 amp circuit.  Some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only 8 amps, so you may want to check this before you buy.Hopefully I will not have to use the Smart Spair.  Based on the good (though limited) experience I have with Slime, I thought it would be good to have around, just in case.  There are many situations, where changing a tire at the side of the road, can be hazardous.  A kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of, jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire.  It does not take a mechanical genius to follow the directions.Accutire MS-5550 is perfect to fit in the trunk of a car/van for those times when an air compressor is needed.  It has the standard adaptors for sports balls, air mattress inflatables etc, and the standard locking valve stem connector.  This works well on bikes and the inflatables.  Car tires take more time to inflate or get up to pressure.  Power for this little compressor comes from the 12 volt outlet in the car/van.  There is good length on the power cord and depending where the 12 volt outlet is on your vehicle it will reach to the car's tires.  Light weight and easy to use make this ideal for carrying around.  The problem with this is that on flat surfaces the compressor doesn't stand still when started.  It will walk around. Gauges are small and hard to read and there didn't seem to be a light for night time reading.  This is basically something to add to the traveling safety kit or to have on hand for those emergency bike tire inflating times.  Made of plastic that feels cheap.  I'm betting this would not take much of a drop to break.  With so many better compressors out on the market today, I can only moderately recommend this one.  It will work but there are better ones, Black & Decker comes to mind, and not for that much more money.A few years ago I purchased a cheaper air compressor here, and it is a very heavy little unit and works well. This unit also works well but is very lightweight for what it is. I'm not sure that the construction will hold up over an extended period of use and hauling.If you were just going to put this in the car trunk in case of emergency, then it would probably work fine, and I'm sure that is the target demographic....casual users and individuals who need to inflate balls, air mattresses, etc. For these buyers, the digital display and light is also a perk for easy use and emergency kits.If you regularly use an air compressor or are a bit rough with your "tools," you might want to take a pass and opt for a unit with meatier construction.
This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket.This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation.

a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied.Water Wetter is designed to be used in a system of solely distilled water. Water Wetter is then added to the mix to help the water have better contact with the metal.  Redline's claim is that with just water air will accumulate due to the heat on the metal's surface and this does not allow maximum heat transfer to the water. The Water Wetter will stop that air from forming thus allowing for more cooling potential. According to their results, up to 20 degrees.Now this can also be used in systems with a mixture of water and antifreeze but the results will be severly diminished, down to just a couple of degrees. On top of that beware of the "black sludge" that can accumulate with Water Wetter combining with certain types of Antifreeze. I would recommened using google to find results on this.Redline does recommened draining and refilling the system of Water Wetter and water once a year. This in my opinion is due to the fact that this is designed to be used in race cars and not so much street vehicles, yes even high performance street vehichles. If you are doing research you will find one over riding response "if you have a cooling system problem this will not fix it."I purchased this before I did enough research. I have decided not to use the product and take a loss on the investment. My car is a street car and I was going to flush my system and use only distilled water, since I live in an area that doesn't have to worry about freezing. After doing my research I will go with just a higher percentage of distilled water to antifreeze. This will help keep my maintenance time to a minimum and also increase my cooling efficiency.Purchased this item to keep on my motorcycle should I pick up a nail/screw while away from home. Tucks away nice and neatly.I did use one plug, it performed as it should and held fine without any air leaks.If making a permanent repair, I would use a combo patch/plug which installs from inside the tire.
This is very handy to have around the house.  Works on any glass surface and truly makes it look invisible.  Just spray and wipe away in straight lines with a towel.  Works well on car windows too, and is safe to use on tinted windows.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...used this stuff to clean my carpet on my 2006 Jeep tj worked great on carpet and upholstery. cleans and brighten seats. mothers is the best.
I bought this because I was in need of one for my car.  It is simple to use and does the job for an inexpensive tire gauge.  You can use it to measure your current tire gauge as well as deflate your tire if you have too much air.works fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.I needed a good grease gun with a flexible hose to properly lube my riding mower and this product does a good job. It's well made and easy to handle. Good purchase.

Would recommend this for anyone with a trailer.If like my garage your power point is on the other side of the workshop or even another room this is perfect for your battery tender. Its well made,  and a safe way to run your cable for some distance.
This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic.This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream.
Used after clay bar treatment on brand new car. Wiped on easily, then wiped off easily with little effort. Used on a white car, so tricky to see where I had applied it and removed it (had to depend on reflections). Be sure to dampen the applicator first--MUCH easier. Used a Meguiar's microfiber applicator pad.I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend.I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal.This is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates.  I see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts....why why why??  Just remove the frame, get these caps and hide the ugly screws.  :)Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps.  Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem.These 3M flexible plastic spreaders are decently made and reasonable priced. The set included three different size spreaders, one each measuring 4", 5" and 6" wide. They worked fine for mixing, spreading and smoothing the 3M #262 and #272 Bondo Glass body fillers I used them with. The pinkish color of these spreaders is supposed to represent the color of regular #262 3M body filler when it is properly mixed with hardener, so you can use them as a visual reference if needed. The spreaders cleaned up easily with acetone and a rag after use. If the ends become worn or rough, I find you can easily trim and taper/sharpen them by running the edge over a sheet of sand paper on a flat surface, like your work bench. Overall, considering what I paid for this set of spreaders here on Amazon, I think they were a good value and would buy them again when needed.
Great clay bar kit that anyone can use, includes two large clay bars, microfiber towel, and clay lube spray.Does what it says. Good quality plastic. Nice size to avoid spills. Good pour spout also. I've used it several times already and highly recommend.The tekton oil filter wrench is ausom. I use it for plumbing purposes,This works great on toilet bolts. I would highly recommend this to anybody who does plumbing and oil changes on there car.
Does a fine job. Only had to do it once last season.  We'll see how it works on a full seasonThese item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanksFilter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.
this product is great for parking a car in the garage.  Easy to install and see.  i would recommend using additional heavy duty double sided tape to ensure it stays in place.  Be sure to wipe down the concrete with alcohol to eliminate any oil residue on the concrete.Used after clay bar treatment on brand new car. Wiped on easily, then wiped off easily with little effort. Used on a white car, so tricky to see where I had applied it and removed it (had to depend on reflections). Be sure to dampen the applicator first--MUCH easier. Used a Meguiar's microfiber applicator pad.it does take a little skill to make sure you dont let it land on any other surface (besides the one your trying to remove 3m from) but honestly it works great. i would recommend this glue remover to anyone who wants to remove decals from there car or remove the glue left over when removed.
For long term accuracy you will have to screw these to your RV. Or you can buy a carpenters level on Amazon and place it on the Floor of your RV to check it for level.I bought these some time ago.I use them mainly to detail my vehicles, cleaning glass is great, just don't use too much glass spray and your windows will turn up crystal clear.I use them "dry" to dust my dash/ door handle, etc...though you can use a quick spritz of some interior detail spray to make it even better.Keep a few in the car incase the windows fog up, these worked great.And you can use in the house as well.....things you can wipe down are only limited to your imagination.Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.
This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.as with allall wheel cleanersnone of them are so good that you can spray on and hose off and the wheels are as clean as new.You will need to scrub those wheels to get them cleanSo why not instead use cheaper,all purpose cleaner which has more uses if you need to scrub, or as consumer reporst suggets zep degreaserI suppose you could use this without first using the Gold Pure Polish and you will get a reasonably shining car.  However, if you want to do the job right, start with the Gold Pure Polish to get the pollution and other crime removed from your finish and the proceed with this glaze.  The glaze is not very thick so be careful squirting it out of the bottle.  This product goes on easily and comes off easily.  Afterwards your vehicle will be shiny, however to go all the way you need to finish the job with the Gold Carnauba Wax.  You need to commit to an entire afternoon to do all three steps.

It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.Once a year seems pretty accurate. I'm sure it varies on where you live, how dirty your car gets, how often you wash it, how you wash it, what detergent you use, etc., etc. But it was highly rated by Consumer Reports so I figured I'd give it a shot. Goes on, wipes off easy - or about the same as other paste waxes I've used. Oh, and yes, this is a polish not a cleaner. If your paint is really dirty, faded, etc, then you need to use a cleaner first then a polish. Put it on thin, in the shade, keep it off plastic, use a microfiber cloth - in other words follow the directions and use it correctly and it works great. And, yes, if you have chips in your paint they will turn white - just like with any other polish.it does take a little skill to make sure you dont let it land on any other surface (besides the one your trying to remove 3m from) but honestly it works great. i would recommend this glue remover to anyone who wants to remove decals from there car or remove the glue left over when removed.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.
I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different.Camco must make an item for even inconceivable storage problems in your RV.  This is a perfect example of a void that probably did not need to be filled.  And actually, I couldn't find an appropriate mounting location in my travel trailer, so I gave it away.  A cheap lesson learned.I used this on my 97 Miata during a complete engine rebuild;The Good;Excellent product, from reports (although not mine personally) one of the best synthetic oils out thereFully SyntheticBottle is easy to use and avoid spills. (I also used a screw-in pump. I recommend you do too)Ships PrimeThe Bad;It can be pricey for what it is.I would use this in any performance car. I do not use it in my Daily Driver (Chevy Suburban with 150k miles)
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersThis worked great for my uses.  I fixed my cars power window with just this.  No tools required, seriously, if you have a stuck window or slow window, try this first before replacing the regulator.I also used this on my home windows and they slide so much easier now.I also use this to lubricate my treadmill belt.
This product is a must have for anyone driving. Not only does it make it safer for highway driving. Especially when occasionally rain drops are the beyond normal and make it difficult and unsafe to drive.One tip this product works well on highway driving during city however it does work but not as well. During highway driving you can actually see the rain "peel away" from your windshield. WOOOSH!!!HI,This product is a great product that helps you to eliminate rattles/vibrations when you are installing speakers into a vehicle's car doors, rear panels, decks, etc.  It does exactly that and it does it well.There are many claims about it stopping distortion, noise, etc....  However, it should be noted that if you are over powering a speaker..distortion will occur and no padding can stop that.Dynamat has been around for ever and continues to provide a solution that eliminates rattle and vibration.  Use it for that and you will agree that it is a 5 Star Product.  Expect miracles and you will be disappointed.This product works fine for your car, only problem is if you have a Mazda 3 that is under a certain year, it's a pain to get to the filter to change it.
Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon.I had a heat stain on 3 week old cobra pipes, this lightened it but did not remove it all together so I'm only giving 4 stars. for the rest of my chrome it does a good job polishing and protecting.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI purchased these for a 2011 2 door jeep wrangler sport, they fit perfectly with little or no effort.all you have to do is clean the area with a damp cloth, wipe down with the provided prep pad and justline up the bolt dome cover. It's almost impossiable not to line them up correctly on the first try.

I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter.

This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare?  No way.Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3.If you have a clear coat scratch, meaning that the clear coat is scratched off and the paint is exposed, then this product is fantastic. It really does work on these types of scratches. If you have a scratch deeper than that, do not bother using this product. Go to the Auto parts store, or the dealer, or on-line and get the exact touch up paint for your vehicle and follow the directions. Good luck - it may never look the same again.

Permatex is the stuff my automotive junkies.  It will allow you to undo what you have done.  You do know that spark plugs come back out don't you?  Make sure the application is correct.  Some metal combinations will prefer nickel over copper based and so on. but for general use, this is the goop for you.If you simply follow the directions this is the best thing you can get to seal your gaskets.expensive, but works, I guess you could just Duct tape the handle instead. stops the noise to, the handle rattles unless secured
Be aware this is a regular cutting board, cut perfectly to size, has a drip guard, with a full sized piece of waffle-type, beige, non-slip rubber material on the bottom, and comes with a free thin plastic cutting mat that you can really use for cutting on. Our new wood board needed some light sanding and oil, and, it is so nice looking it will probably be only used for counter space, not for cutting on. It can be cut on but the free mat will be fine. It fits perfectly and has some weight to it and it does not move during travel on curvey or bumpy roads. Great price, fast ship, protected well, and it is a great counter space increaser, and silencer of the metal stove-top cover 'rattle', which we notice in a motor-home. You do not really need a folding metal stove top cover, and most RV's are short on kitchen counter space. This is the perfect solution with a bonus. I think they include the plastic cutting mat knowing the board will not be used. Get this if you have an RV with this sized stove-top. I do not know anything about the Silent Stove Top Cutting board, except the photos show no drip guard. This is less expensive and I cannot imagine anything working, or looking, better than this. Highly recommend! You do not install this. Simply remove the metal cover (quick and simple) and set this on the burner grate, and that's it. My sanding and oil is just what one should do to a nice piece of wood.  Use mineral oil, or cutting board oil, on both sides and all edges and do not let the board dry-out or be subjected to very high or low temperatures. I added more counter space at the end of a counter by ordering two  8"x8" brown hinges and a very nice looking 3/4" teak cutting-board from Amazon.

The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.A well made piece. This brush is not too stiff and the ice scrapper part is located on the opposite side of the handle (convenient if you only need to brush off the show or leaves). Rubberized handle allows for a good, solid grip. Lightweight.
Just get this for your Hi-Lift jack. It is a large chunk of molded oil based product that keep the bar from clanging against the rest of the jack. Everyone in the vehicle will thank you for this. It looks better than the oily rag or duct tape stuck onto the handle, and it works. My only gripe is that this should be included with the jacks. Hi-Lift could take some marketing cues and just include this. Since the handle needs to be stowed in the "Up" position to be safe for you and the jack, this should be dummy corded to the jack itself. That is one modification made to mine so as not to lose it. I drilled a hole in it and dummy corded it to the jack itself with parachute cord. Since it is black it could be easily lost at night.This product, in my opinion, is well designed. The materials are top notch, and it is easy to access with the key for removal and installation.I can't imagine anyone taking the time to defeat this lock to steel my hitch ball. When the boat is attached and locked to the ball I can sleep better in a hotel room knowing the boat is secure.I've notice a few times the rubber cover over the key slot has come off. I'm not sure if I just didn't attach it well, if I bumped it, or if it came off by itself though. Even so I don't think the rubber cover is a necessity.You'd be hard pressed to find this product to be not functional.  It is fused and connects right to the battery.  All in all it works like it should and it is easy to install.
needed to order one smaller item to get free shipping, and have a motorcycle that will need an oil change soon, so it fit both needsGot one of these mounted in my vehicle. Seems to have a quality build and a ok mount. Makes install a little easier, just remember that you'll have to get to this ASAP is something does happen so mount it somewhere you'll be able to get to even if you're upside down. ( Hopefully never ) This is just another one of those "just incase" tools that you carry and hope you never need. But better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it.Nice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The filter fits perfectly.  The instructions for replacing the used filter are incomplete as they do not address the touring model which has a slow release lever to open the lower glove box gently. It must be detached first. Then the stops on both side must actually be removed (they are designed that way) to lower the glove box and access the filter holder.  Because plastic parts must be detached and removed this process should not be done in cold weather conditionsThe flat surface perpendicular to the valve axis is what makes this gauge especially easy to use.  It allows your thumb to easily push down while the main grip remains firmly in your hand. Moreover, the readout is very easy to see.  Combining both elements, the Accutire is an excellent product to use in low light environments or when the the weather is poor.
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.

Saves me from having to run around with the bubble level checking to see if the trailer is level front to back and side to side. Seem to stick pretty well also. Very Happy so far. Fast ship from Amazon.Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer.

Decided not to attach it to the counter behind the stove. New camper phobia. Makes a nice work space. Put it on the bed when we travel so it does not rattle.What's to say?  It's not very large.  It works perfect in my 2003 Chevy truck to add a Fuel Additive into the fuel tank!!!  It should work for Power steering and transmission also, at least on Car/trucks that's not hard to get to or down load were access is bad.  The design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it!  For under $5, not a bad deal.  Hang it up out of the way when done with it.  It's able to fit into your Transmission Dip Stick tube, so it has to be small enough, so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once!!!  It's small and doesn't hold all that much.  For what it is, I like it.I don't need to do a long review to convey the basics that this pin works perfectly to secure your hitch to the receiver.  There's a little anodized flare, and a decent little rubber cap to keep the grit out of the lock mechanism and it's stainless steel to boot!  Nice quality item.
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost.I bought this product and you can't tell from the picture, but it has an extra 'ring' that keeps it attached to the hitch even when the plug is not in the hitch... when you're using it to tow or to hold a rack.  This is a great bargain for the money and seems to be a genuine Mopar part.I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need.
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver.Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.  I typically prefer to go up a size on wipers since it gives a larger clean area.  You can typically go up 2 inches which translates to one inch per side from where the blade attached to the arm.  When the car is dirty, you should be able to see where that extra inch goes - if it hits the top of the trim or other part, you're out of luckWe're using a 28" blade on the drivers side of my wife's Mazda5, and this clears very nicely - no skips or squeaking.  Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier.
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.
All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change.I'm not sure how accurate this thing is.  I have a new battery but this will show less than 12V after a few hours with the engine off.  It will, however, show over 14V after the engine is started.  I would assume if it stays consistent that you can tell if there is a problem at some point in the future.  I think this is more useful than the factory gauge.  I would recommend getting this type of voltage meter if your battery is getting old.Sorry to say, I  have never used the sewer hose support as of yet.  So  I can not really say how good it is. I guess it is a great hose support if you have to use it.  Sorry, can not say how it works
Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one.It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper. Easy to use and sturdy. Is not a eyesore, and seems well made, i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest, it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire, but when the thief see's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel, it won't be so much a snatch and grab. Some piece of mind to myself. I run 31.10.50 x 15&#34; wheels (over $350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $1750), with a Smitybilt tire carrier, the 36&#34; cable was plenty long enough.This is a nice alternative to welding a tab on a hitch for a sway control. While I don't plan on having to move it to another hitch it is nice to know that if I had to I could. Which is something that can't be done with a weld on tab.
I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.I appreciate that it comes with a full array of battery-ends (4 each of alligator clips and screw-attached).  The simple lights means I can &#34;read&#34; it from across the room...Only 4 stars, though, because it's *not possible* to get 4 cars close enough to this thing to use it as is.  Either you need to pull the batteries out (annoying) or buy a pile of the 25' extension cables (what I did) to reach over to the cars.I'd think, at this price, throwing in at least a couple extension cords would not be unreasonable (heck, even increase the price to include them...who wouldn't use them?)I have a 1993 M35A3 with 6 Michelin 14.5 XLs and a spare.  The CTIS (central tire inflation system) had been disconnected, and the split wheel o-rings need to be replaced.  This means that I have 7 huge tires with slow leaks.  I have the truck in an apartment complex parking lot with no electricity for my big Makita 5hp compressor.  And my honda generator cant crank over the Makita.  I had a little red compressor from VIAR, which was good in the emergency I needed it for, but got so hot in inflating these tires that it melted the yellow hose.The 450P was hooked up to my yellow goodyear hose and Subaru Outback (running), and put to work right out of the box.  It took 5 of these tires from 15 lbs or less to 45 lbs in about 35 minutes.  When you have 13,000 lbs of truck, having tires that roll is critical, because even a wrecker can't move them with deflated tires.  The pump was hot, but the inflating pipe on the compressor runs through the padded handle, which allows you to pick it up when hot.  The gauge has a trigger and a  lever that holds fitting on to the tire valve, which is really handy.  Having a switch vs using the battery clamps to start saves on sparking.I was at a loss as to how I was going to get these tires inflated in remote situations with out a huge generator to run a huge compressor...so this continuous duty 12v pump was very timely.(for those of you who are military truck experts, I am aware the M35A3 has an on board compressor, but there is a blockage somewhere ahead of the 'glad hands.')  The M35A3 is about the largest truck (23,000 lbs gvw) you can drive in NC without a license , and has 7 really big tires to say grace over.  This is not a replacement for a functioning CTIS or a big compressor, but will get even the largest tires inflated and rolling.
I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done.Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.

An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.As good as the factory original.

I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.My screen door is metal insert and this closure kit will not work to close it without major modifications. Cannot recommend. The manufacturer could be clearer as to where and how this works because I see a lot of RVs where I live where this type of device is useless and people waste money buying it.As an engineer, its pretty rare that I find a product that I can't find fault with. Probably 98% of the stuff I own and that I buy, could use improvement in one way or another. This falls in the rare and coveted 2% that I would call a perfect product. Its waterproof, (big deal for a car battery charger) it can't be easily short circuited, it automatically cuts off at full charge, and it has a float mode. Don't know what more you could ask for a $30 car charger. As far as that goes, I'd say its probably the best one on the market and will be for a long while to come. Very satisfied with it. The only thing that it can't do is revive what they call &#34;sleeping battery&#34;. But its my understanding that you need a much larger apparatus for that.
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.I replaced a rear sensor in a 1999 camry 4 cyl with this sensor to eliminate a check engine light failure.  It was easier than using an identical replacement because the cable ran through the floor pan under the driver's seat.  By using this I just cut the wires underneath the car, spliced them with included splices and heat shrink and added a layer of self-sealing rubber tape to protect and waterproof the splices.  No more check engine light for about $30.Update: Replaced the rear sensor on my 1998 camry also with perfect success - they went bad on both cars at around 120000 miles.I bought this for my 2012 Forest River R-Pod 177 stock tongue jack.  It fits on the post just fine with no modifications to either the jack post or the foot plate required.  I agree with some of the other posts that suggest that a weep hole be drill into the plate to allow fluid to drain.
Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.this replaces the oem anode / plug exactly and is of good quality.  keep a good one of these in the tank or the water will begin to canabalize your tank and fittings.  just a word to the wise.I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckHope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned.I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.
I get that this is the size that it is so it can be set inside of a sink, but who does that anyway??!!  It's designed to be set on the counter and allow the water to drain into the sink - they would have made this much more functional had they made it twice the length so it could accommodate more dishes.  A nice effort by Camco, but overall disappointed at the missed opportunity.It does have a notch in the drain tray that goes over raised beveled sink edges, so that's pretty useful....oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now.I have a tandem-axel trailer, and the suspension is such that when one tire is on this Leveler, the trailer is NOT lifted high enough to get the 2nd tire off the ground too.  This has the effect of putting unevenly distributed weight on the axels AND limiting the leveling effect.If you have a single axel, this will work GREAT.  I'm still giving this 5-starts based on it's solid construction and how easy it is to back up onto a stepped ramp.  But, if you have tandem axels AND their suspension is like mine...you'll need to pass on this one.  I gave mine to a friend with a single-axel tent-trailer, and he loves it.
Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.Great fit for my 2009 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  I couldn't find any other shades that fit the unique window shape well, and while this item is pricey, it is worth it.  To stow it you do have to roll it up which many cases has caused it to be flattened while in the vehicle, but it held up well.Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though.
This is heay gauge,and heavy duty!I use this to connect up to my 1150 cca diehard marine battery.With the battery tender,Cigarette socket installed,I then plug in my ARB Cooler,load up and head out.With the pre installed 75a fuse it won't fail,never does!I have one on my motorcycle, and purchased this one to tend my trailer batteries through the winter. I went onto the Battery tender web site to find out how to hook up batteries in parallel so I can charge the 2 Marine deep cycle batteries that power my trailer. It is working great and looking at the diagrams I will be able to hook up my 2 spare trailer batteries in parallel for a total of 4 deep cycle batteries.i bought this to replace worn out pins and springs on my 20 year old Hi Lift Jack... Jack is still in good working order and will use the fix it kit, as a back up!
Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems.I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
ran this below the carpet to the rear of my jeep. i did not want to run a permanent additional, and having the ability to plug in to my cigarette or power outlet gives me the best of both worlds.I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi DevilleI haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.

I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom.  On some vehicles with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless.
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.I have a 2001 Silverado with a 5.3 engine. On the 2001, 5.3 engine the Knock sensors sit in deep pockets. Water tends to get down in there sooner or later and that causes the knock sensors to fail. Replace the harness while you are at, as the harness is the seal.This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back.
Product works great!  Can't speak much for durability, but it seems like the hard (but pliable) plastic tube would be easy to pinch.  The end piece has good length, good to reach in hard to reach spots to hear what is going on.excellent grease gun! easy to load, easy to use and the longer hose is great!keeps your jeep cleaneasy to installeasy to take out and cleaneasy to uselooks good too:)
I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.I have purchased other tire gauges from Accutire and have found them to be sturdy, long lasting and accurate. I purchased this gauge for use on my Honda Goldwing motorcycle. I needed a right angle low clearance gauge to clear the brake disks and check my suspension pressure. I also have found the gauge convenient for my wife's Honda 50, 2013 Honda CRV w/TPM valves and my ATV's. With this gauge I don't have to bend or place angle pressure on the sides of the tire valve stems.
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine.This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it.Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet...
I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections.MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing.

This is my third K&N; filter that I had purchased. When Amazon had a sale, I immediately bought a third for my 05 Camry. I also have filters for my 2007 Highlander and 1997 Chevy G3500. They all have given me smoother acceleration and a 10% increase in fuel economy. I went from 19-20MPG to 22-23MPG. It's only a couple MPG, but it really adds up in the long run. I wasn't expecting massive gains, because as other reviewers have said, if these filters gave significant increases in MPG, all the Car manufacturers would be installing these as standard or creating their own versions.As for the horsepower increase claim, I would only know if I put the car on a Dyno, so I can't say if there's a difference.Overall, worth the buy if you don't want to keep buying new disposable filters.I purchased two of these 20' ft heavy duty tow straps to leave in the back of my 2007 tahoe.  I have pulled multiple cars out of ditches with these straps. They are a life saver and not expensive.  I would have paid double for these.  These are a great emergency item to leave in the trunk of your car.  You never know when you will need them.I still use the square aluminum jack stands and I guess it really all depends on the brand you have or something cause these pads needed to be about 1/8&#34; bigger to fit mine so I was not pleased with that though I didn't have anything to block up my tongue when parked so these worked for that I guess. They need to make these things a TINY bit bigger then they can put a picture of a basic jack stand on the front .... till they do it;s really false advertising cause they do not fit either sets of my regular square aluminum jack stands.
Haven't used it yet because I'm still looking for the interface to hook on my buffer wheel...I bought something for that and I'm still back to &#34;square zero&#34;...you would think that in the marketing of this sort of product the seller would fill in the gaps on the other things you need to hook everything up. Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine.I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money.When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it...
Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!Light-weight, easy-to-read meter with adjustable head. You can leave it in the electrical socket for constant monitoring or keep it in the tool box or glove compartment for occasional check ups. Highly recommended
the thing i like about this oil is the zddp content and additive package is alot better then most oils,this is a good oil for high performance cars.one thing id like to educate some viewers on is when you look at any oil for your high performance car,one thing you need to make sure it doesn't say on bottle(usually on the back)is resource conserving,when you buy resource conserving oils and put them in high performance cars,they will hurt your motor,resource conserving oils are good for daily driven cars that aren't doing anything performance oriented such as high rpm high load situations,the additive package in them is not sufficient for protecting your motor.just some food for thought next time your shopping for oil for your awesome rideNice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps.The problem with finding suitable spark plugs for your vehicle is that other than the OEM that comes with your car, the quest is trial and error,  some may say they're the best, then you put them in your car and they don't do their job... so it's all trial and error, once you find the ones that work, stick to those.some tips i can give are the following... search on the web for previous owner experiences to make a big picture of what you ought to be looking for; ALWAYS gap the plugs as specified in your car manual or the suggested gap by the spark plug brand for your car;  use correct and equal torque when installing all plugs on all cylinder heads.Ive heard a rule ... if your car is jap, buy jap plugs (denso, ngk) if your car is american, buy american (champion, autolite), if your car is euro, buy euro plugs (bosch)NGK iridium are great buy, excellent quality and performance and fairly priced.
A well made piece. This brush is not too stiff and the ice scrapper part is located on the opposite side of the handle (convenient if you only need to brush off the show or leaves). Rubberized handle allows for a good, solid grip. Lightweight.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?
I bought two sets of Braxton seat covers: A tan set, and this grey set.  They both fit well and look good.Installation was easier than I expected.  Not surprisingly, they were much easier to slide over the leather seats.  It wasn't hard getting them on my cloth seats, just a bit more difficult.  On the up side, they don't slip around as much on the cloth seats.The seat covers have a little flap that you have to wedge through the gap where the seat bottom meets the seat back.  That flap has holes in it.  The bottom of the seat cover, near the back, has an elastic band on each side, with a plastic hook on the end.  (Two extra hooks are also included with each cover, affixed in a little bag to the inside of the seat cover bottom.)  After sliding the seat cover into place and getting the flap through that gap, you attach the hooks to the holes in the flap.The hardest part of installation wasn't the fault of the seat covers, but because of how my Sonata's seats are designed.  The cloth on the seat back extends past the gap where the seat back meets the seat bottom.  There are a couple hidden straps that hook the cloth to the underside of the seat.  Once I figured out how to unhook that, I was able to access the flaps of the seat covers, and finish installation.I got two slightly different "versions" of the Braxton seat covers.  My grey set is, according to the date on the box, a few years older than the tan set.  The flap on the older seat covers is a simple flap with two holes in it.  The tan set I have has flaps with four holes in them, and the end of the flaps also have a spongy, cylindrical insert in them.  This insert is presumably intended to help keep the seat cover in place.  The additional holes must be to accommodate different seat designs.  I found both changes (the extra holes and the spongy insert) completely needless, but maybe on some vehicles they would be helpful.  The spongy insert did (of course) make it harder to get the flap through the gap in the seat.In short, these seat covers fit smoothly in both my cars.  They look quite good and they don't slide around enough to be a problem.  They make leather seats more comfortable year-round, and they help keep sweat and dirt off cloth seats.Be sure to check your owner's manual before installing seat covers. Some vehicles have air bags built into the seats, and any kind of covering could impede air bag function. (In fact, the aforementioned Sonata has air bags built into the seats, and I had to stop using these covers in that car.)Recommended!Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.
Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice.Another of the must haves for RV-ing, If you don't have it when you need it, you will be sorry.'Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter.
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.This stuff is expensive and you only get a small amount.  Lets face it, 32oz is a medium soda.  MOTHERS, please give us a little more for the $, your product is great though.  4 stars for quality, loses the 5th for the amount you get for the $.Nice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps.
It worked perfectly to remove the spark plugs. the grip part is left visible when inserted in the spark plug hole, so, you can continue removing or adjusting the spark plug with hand. good tool, right size.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderAmazon said it fit a 2007 Honda Element, but the Element wiper arm is not a J hook. Amazon needs to fix their wizard; this makes me hesitant to purchase other auto parts from them.Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car
These shocks fit perfectly, and provided enough power to lift the hood without effort.  I would highly recommend them if they make a model for your vehicle.I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.Overall this is a pretty nice little unit.  It is compact, shipped in a compact box and the overall product quality is good. Product comes with an easily removable vacuum pump, solid plastic collection ball, collection tube of larger diameter tubing that connects to a smaller diameter tube that looks to be wire reinforced plastic covered tubing that easily should fit in most dipstick tubes. Tubes were long enough so I could sit the unit on the floor and have plenty of tube to insert down the dipstick tube.  Very easy to set up and use and the included red funnel makes it very easy and neat to pour the waste into a container for recycle.  The pump, funnel and the tube simply push onto the ball which has rubber type attachments.  I put a little oil on the o-ring under the top rubber piece to help improve the seal.  I bought this to change engine oil for a car that uses 7 liters of 5w-30 synthetic oil.  I ran the engine to heat up the oil some before I started the removal.  The system worked and got just about all of the oil out of the engine through the dipstick.  BUT, it took 4 hours to extract the oil.  The oil moves very slowly through the 1/8&#34; diameter or so tube that is inserted into the dipstick.  With the viscosity of the oil, the small diameter of the tubing and the limited amount of vacuum you can create - you can expect anywhere from 1/2 hour to 1 hour per quart. I tried this with some lighter viscosity fluids and it works really good.  This will be good for the snowblower, generator and other small oil volume units I have.  If you have time this is a nice item.  If you want it done quick this will not be your best option.
Does a fine job. Only had to do it once last season.  We'll see how it works on a full seasonDoes just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that.Does exactly what I had planned.  Fairly sturdy item that should perform well for a long time.  Not complicated to use.
Matched my car's color perfectly!  I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review...ok, if you read the reviews, you will see lots of "oh the cord is so long, it has to run by the brake pedals, its not 100% accurate" blah blah wah wah. This device simply reads and displays what the vehicles computer is showing. is anything 100% accurate? hardly. but it does a good job. for the people who say its not helping my mpg, are u kidding? this device does not have anything to do with CONTROLLING your mpgs, your FOOT does! the only way this helps is as a reminder that if you drive like an idiot, u use more gas. if u need a computer to tell u that, dont drive! yes the cord routes by the pedals, thats where OBD ports are. not everything in the world can be bluetooth, deal with it. use a little common sense and route the cord. this thing is handy, and works as advertised. only reason im taking a star away, is that it is a little expensive for what it is, however, with my luck, now that ive bought it, the price will drop. overall a great gadget, that can be saved and used on any future vehicles i may buy.EDIT/UPDATE:  after using the gauge a few different ways now, ive found the average mpg very helpful. it really makes you realize the best way to increase mpg. i thought before if i grandma the pedal always it wud help, takes more than that.Nice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps.
If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me.If you want a good shine that will last because you hate waxing your car, then this is for you. I used it and it really did almost last for a year. I would say maybe 6-8 months or so. That is pretty good and close to a year. Be sure that your car is as clean as possible, you may want to use a polish before using this, but you are probably lazy since you hate waxing your car, so you can use this right after your car is washed. If you want to do the once over on your paint, once a year, I would recommend the following: Wash your car using Meguiars Gold Class; it is an excellent shampoo and conditioner for your car. Clay bar your car. The clay bar is probably the easiest product to use. It is almost effortless. You mist a section 18&#34; x 18&#34; with a quick detailer (yes Meguiars has an excellent quick detailer), then you use the clay bar with medium pressure. Make about 10 passes. Then you lightly wipe dry. Your paint will be very slick and you should not feel any grit after using it. Do NOT drop the clay or you may scratch the heck out of your paint.You have to throw it out and use a fresh clay bar. After you have completed the entire car with the clay bar, you can then use a polish. Yes I know Nu finish states that it is a polish, but we will pretend it is a protectant. Use a polish (similar to Meguiars polish - yes I love Meguiars products and no I do not have stock in the company). Then you can apply the Nu finish. One reviewer said to dampen the applicator; that is probably a good idea. Do one section at a time. As with any &#34;protectant products&#34; if you use too much it will be difficult to remove. Since you are going to be doing this once every 6-8 months, take the extra time and effort to do it correctly. After the Nu finish, may I suggest that you use Meguiars NXT 2.0. It is a polymer sealant that works very well. In summary:  Wash, Clay Bar, Polish, Nu Finish, and the optional poly sealant. If you are very lazy you can do your car in 2 steps. Drive it through the expensive car wash, and then use the Nu Finish. Good luck.Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately.with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.
If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI.It does what it's supposed to do and the price is right so I would recommend it if you need to use pop rivets.All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change.
At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet.Most manufacturers use a variation of lubricant similar to ATF to insure smooth shifting, even when the transmission is cold. They also rarely specify a change interval.  If you want the best lubricant for your manual transmission, MTL is it.  It requires a slow hand on frigid days, but will insure the transmission will last the life of the vehicle.The thread chaser is a sort of thread tap that is intended to help restore the female threads in your cars exhaust system when installing that expensive, new oxygen sensor. It does its job if used correctly; which is to advance it slowly with a forward-and-back motion to clear the chips and debris, while keeping it oiled.
I have seen this type of dual check tire inflator with gauge at many service stations. No more airing up then change to a gauge to read the pressure. Gets tiring if you are checking all the tires on an RV. With the build in gauge you get the reading constantly as you put air in the tires. This is going to be my main tool for the RV.Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.
This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles, including my Explorer.  Located along the driver side frame rail, just under the driver's seat and behind the tire.  You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford,KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect, orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands.  Open the fuel fill cap, remove the fuel pump fuse (if applicable), and disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines.  Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first.  Then remove the other end which leads to the engine.  If you have never changed the fuel filter, with age & corrosion, this may be harder to do than you think.  Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines.  But with regular service, your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional.  If you don't care about gasoline getting on your skin, and in your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then don't wear any safety equipment.  If you have a water heater, or any other source of open flame with a pilot light, then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up.  IF you smoke.....well, enjoy your last cigarette.  Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette.I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.
Won't work miracles if you haven't washed your car, but provides a good looking shine in between your trips to the Car Wash. A must have.If you ride around the roads of south Florida then you need this product in your tires. You will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! It worksWorks very well and is easy to work with. Make sure you use gloves because you will get splinters in your hands if you don't.
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.works fantastic and would recommend it. i own custom wheels n wanted a good product to keep it clean for car shows. this does the work perfect.Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.
Simple device, works fine, not hard to read.  Nice to have this gauge to check tires from time to time and be able to verify what the tire guys are telling you.Extremely easy to use to monitor and maintain tire pressures to ensure the best tire wear and fuel efficiency. Nicely done.Very neat tool to remove battery post without twisting or jerking cables try to pull them out from battery .This tool also can be used to remove windshield wiper arms or other small job need to slowly easy to pull out the part. Good to have in tool box, special for mechanic use to replace battery when remove cables .
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.I am satisfied with this product, and what it does, because we all know how rust is and if we don't, let me say it can be a pain in the but you know what i'm trying to say, so to expect miracles would be beyond expectations.will use again.I must have misunderstood how this siphon works. I have never been able to get it work at all. I have tried every possible method  and no luck. I understand how gravity works but apparently this device doesn't. If you get it to work, more power to you.
I really like having these.  I have one for the bowls, same size fits paper saucers, and I have one for 9 inch paper plates. So 2 sizes for 3 different uses.Now, double it, because I have them for the travel trailer as well.  Which is why I first bought them.  I like them so much, I got them for the house kitchen.I used rustoleum for plastic- spray paint, and painted them a tan to match the cabinets.Now when someone wants a snack, a bowl of cereal or a sandwich, these are used, and plastic spoons and I have way less dirty dishes to wash! They are mounted under the kitchen cabinets making it easy for tweens to reach as well, but not for toddlerish and say 5 year olds who love to play with anything new!They are absolutely for me worth the cost.  So convenient.  You do have to separate out the paper plates, etc. unless you don't mind wasting a few at a time...I bought mine in bulk here from Amazon and costs about a penny apiece...I have a 30' travel trailer.  It has built in jacks at the front and rear (4 total) along with the tongue jack but it still tends to bounce no matter how tight you get those jacks.Not a major problem, but a minor annoyanceSo I ordered these.  My camper has twin axles and the axles are square.  I put these under one of the axles and crank them up as tight as I can.  It removes 99% of the bounce in the camper.I recommend these to anyone that wants to use them for this purpose.  I suppose you could also use them at the front and back, if you don't have built in jacks.I have one Battery Tender Plus and love it, No problems with it. Works Great on the quads and motorcycle, Also put it on my electric start generator. I make a habit of every month to swap it from one unit to the other for a couple of days.Till fully charged. All batteries keep at full charge. Also put it on my pick up and jeep when i don't drive them much.Also i charge the battery in the trailer. I guess i am to cheap to buy another. But this way i look at the batteries and check.The pick up and Jeep and trailer have big batteries and take a little longer to fully charge. Great unit.A must have and AMAZON has a great price.
Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast (received next day) and just got done hooking it up. I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals). I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged. It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling. Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs. The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase.My bike came with a Yuasa battery and I"ve heard good things about Yuasa.  So why not buy a charger from the same company that makes your batter??Its nice to have the two types of batter connectors.  I mount the hard-wire kit to my motorcycle and whenever it will sit for a while, i can charge the battery without needing to take off the seat, etc to get to the batter.  Then you also have the alligator clips to use when you need to charge other batteries like lawn equipment.This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System Tester
Bought this charger to replace the rediculous charger that comes with power wheel cars and trucks. Had to do some minor wiring connector swaps, but this charger is soooo much faster and actually let's me know when the battery is done! Terrific charger, I would buy another!!! Can't beat the price and functionality......I have this connected to my car's battery (located in the trunk) 24/7/365.  This tender turns off when battery reaches optimal charge.  In addition, the tender has a connector so you can connect it to your battery with one easy plug.  The tender is extremely convenient and with its led light lets you know if the battery is charged or being charged.  When it's time to drive I simply unplug tender and off I go.  I highly recommend this item.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.
Armor All tire shine does a great job.  I use it on two vehicles tires, a Malibu and Chev 2500 Pickup.  Lasts a couple of weeks, unless it rains of course.  I get 3 to 4 all tire shines per can.  Recommend!Purchased this charger and the case (medium size). Both work well and I can trust that this charger will not &#34;over charge&#34; my ATV battery. After using it several time (for maintenance reasons) this charger will completely charge my batter in about 2 1/2 hours. Other type I had to almost 2 days to charge (wall wart type charger). The quality with this charger is far better than most of the other cheap types. Worth it if you need a good charger.This digital tire gauge drains battery even if you are not using it.I checked my tires once a month, but, I already have to change battery about once per year.The gauge still use power to memoris the pre-setting of tire pressure. come to think about it, thepre-set memory is useless if you have 2 different cars. (Because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting). The 2032 lithiumX2 battery is not cheap, I expect it should last at least 5 years.
I used to take out my boat battery and bring it into the house to keep it trickle charged. With this extension cable I can now charge it right in the driveway without having to pull the battery every time!!! my back loves thisAwesome. You could run a regular (probably orange) extension cord through your garage and then have your battery tender plugged into it on the floor and trip over it constantly or you could buy one of these extensions made for the tender and have it run along your ceiling inconspicuously or run along the baseboard of a wall out of sight and then have it come up right where you need it for your car, truck or motorcycle.This is heay gauge,and heavy duty!I use this to connect up to my 1150 cca diehard marine battery.With the battery tender,Cigarette socket installed,I then plug in my ARB Cooler,load up and head out.With the pre installed 75a fuse it won't fail,never does!
I'VE HAD THIS PRODUCT BEFORE AND FOUND IT QUITE SATISFACTORY....ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR EASY REMOVING OF BIRD DROPPINGS ON MY BLACK CARS....WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT...THX...NICE PRODUCT DOES WHAT IS MEANT TO DO. THE TAPE SEEMS TO HOLD PRETTY GOOD ONLY TIME WILL TELL SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ALONG TIME AGO.BOUGTH THESE WITH THE THOUGHT OF REPLACING CLEANING CLOTHS OR RAGS AS THEY ARE BETTER KNOWNTHESE ACTUALLY DO THE JOB AND THE PRICE IS GREAT

The unique locking pin makes these worthwhile. However, when you read the instructions, it's not clear how to bend the "tab" to hold the supports in the frame. Best way is to take a big screwdriver and bend them inward. Can't believe they don't put that on the instructions, since it's not intuitive.What can I say? It does what it says and I like the weight of it...makes it feel solid. I also like the LED light they put in so you can take the pressure in the dark/dim light.A bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way.  It's manageable to lock and unlock, but you have to do it at a slight angle and/or wiggle it in.  The black makes it look hidden and matches nice.
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet.With the cheapest small lawn batteries over $30 this charger maintainer only makes sense.  If you do not want to hard wire it, the kit comes with a set of clamps.  Anyone can install this, its so easy, literally just plug it in.  Keep in mind though, it will not &#34;fix&#34; a battery that is already gone.  If your fed up with jumping off or replacing your lawn equipment batteries every year, then this is for you.First of all, the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car's motor. Secondly, the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable.
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletThe 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC.The flat surface perpendicular to the valve axis is what makes this gauge especially easy to use.  It allows your thumb to easily push down while the main grip remains firmly in your hand. Moreover, the readout is very easy to see.  Combining both elements, the Accutire is an excellent product to use in low light environments or when the the weather is poor.
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more.Ive always used screes, picks, pliers to get my cam seals out.  I dont know why i didnt buy one of these sooner.I've not used this yet. I hope I never need to, actually. If I do, I will certainly update this review. :)
I like using this mitt - I use it for waxing not washing... It's not great for initially working in wax - you can't beat a good microfiber cloth for that, but for a solid once over afterwards, this is a great mitt.This is a very good quality wax, for the price, you get easy application, and easy buff, it gives a great shine, doesn&#8217;t last long though, especially if the vehicle is exposed to the sun regularlyThis stuff is expensive and you only get a small amount.  Lets face it, 32oz is a medium soda.  MOTHERS, please give us a little more for the $, your product is great though.  4 stars for quality, loses the 5th for the amount you get for the $.
Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages.i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price
I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged.PROS:Indicator light while charging. Shows when charging is complete.AC power cable.Easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary.I have several Classic cars, a motorcycle battery, and two boat batteries that I need to keep charged, so I purchased the Battery Tender 4-Bank Battery Management System to help me keep the batteries at the optimum charge level over long periods of non-use.I have had several batteries go bad from overcharging on regular battery chargers, and from sulphating when not using or charging them for extended periods.  I decided to get the Deltran 4-Bank system to extend the useful life of my batteries  and hopefully, it will pay for itself in prolonged battery life for all of my different battery applications.
Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.These Jumper cables are heavy Duty, Yet easy to Store. I keep them in one of my containers on my delivery vehicle. They are high quality. They are 4 gauge cable, so they are perfect and long enough to Start are Utilimaster Diesel trucks when are batteries are run Down. There are more expensive cables and even more sever duty use cables. these are perfect for this type of vehicle in an Emergency. The cost is reasonable as well. With 25 feet, you don't have to get real close to the other vehicle. you can pull up to the back and or side and just run the cables under or down the side of the vehicle.
haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump.this has been a must have in the detailing word. This holds SO much water and comes with a nice container to stow it away.  Quality and works excellent, does not scratch.  NEVER use another brand!This scanner does the work it is intended to. And it seems it has to be installed in the car to enjoy it's benefits. But the tip of the cable connection got broken and one has to order another cable.... seems like a common issue from previous reviews
This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.Great for a 3" wide receiver for Tacoma or Tundra. It can be hard to find a hitchpin that is for a wider/reinforced receiver. This works well with some small room to spare. Highly recommend.
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.Will last for a long time. A great price. This is really something that will extend the life of any gas powered engine. Use the blue which is better than the pink. Remember you get what you pay for.arrived quickly. The product is good and you can't beat the price for exactly what is does (cover the end bumper hole)......
This stuff is amazing this is my third bottle of this product and I have to say it is the best quick detailer, in between washes this product brings the mirror like shine right back to where it should be.this product does what it is supposed to do, but, I am not real happy with the quality of construction.This is a great product at a great price. I used it to listen to the cam banks on my BMW to isolate which the noise is coming from and what the root cause might be. It's the first time I have used a device like this but it's amazing how effective a simple, old school device like this is. Considering how much vehicles cost, mechanics charge per hour, parts cost, etc., this tool is indispensible.
There is an acceptable itsy bitsy leak left. You can watch &#34;Fixing Oil Seal Leaks Fast&#34; video on YouTube by scottykilmer. You need 8 ounces for car engine or transmission usage, and 3 ounces for power steering. I am going to order more for power steering and transmission usage.This will save having to replace the battery as often. Keeps the battery on full charge and ready go all the time.I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.
Best Full Synthetic motor oil you can buy next to AMSOIL or Redline.  If you want to do your own research, visit [...] and you can learn a lot.Overall: highly recommended. First use was enough for me. Hopefully this product will withstand weekly washings. Will keep you updated if it doesn't.Below is the formula:1/3: to the manifold (using brake booster)1/3: to the fuel tank1/3: to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner. Remember: do it at night, otherwise, you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke.
this hose feels really sturdy, used it to fix old boat (sold it though), fix transmission and steering lines in cars. this is high quality hose, made in USAThe picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.I purchased this wheel lock punch for my newly acquired OEM wheel locks i purchased from Amazon. The only thing i hate about this pouch is that it is not made of the material depicted in the picture. It is made out of Nylon.
Very cheaply made product. It works but could be made with better quality product. Probably wouldn't buy this product againok, but very light weightI chose this product because of its rated quality.  The price was right, and well made and user friendly.  I would recommend this to anyone.
It is a battery in a box that will help you jump start vehicles.  Love the plug and leave it charging.  This unit, at least the one I got, has the built in self charger that will not allow over charging of the battery.  I also like the fact it does not have all the gadgets the other unit out there have.  They filled the space in this unit with a bigger battery!!If you want a powerful diagnostic device, this is what you are looking for. I have been using other diagnostic devices in the past but there's nothing compared to this because not all error codes show on the dashboard but this scanner brought out one error that other scanners could not detect. Nice buy!I do not know if this is any better than any other but I have 4 of them and have given several as presents. This works on all types of batteries and even my 2009 BMW motorcycle when BMW says it will not.Good product
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.Outa of box,  pleanty of power to fill my dirt bike low tires,  and also jump start  on a cold day my honda 450x battery, i had battery pigtails  on bike all ready  for  battery tender charger, the fesature of  cross polarity  a plus ! good package  and beats  the harbor fright model,  and  added bonus of inverter cvharger  for  camping. The DOWN side the radio is  very very cheesy, dial is off on settings, the sounds  sounds  like a radio from 1964, Havent used the  jump start yet, i will today ,I used this to wrap the ehaust system on my 2004 Yamaha R6. Went on good and looks good against the black frame. Also keeps the heat down from buring the track plastics!
I qualify 5 stars because it would be unfair to give a bad reputation, I purchased this product on September 27, I Bought 2 Armor extreme shine, I live in South America so I need an address where my purchases must arrived in the united States and then send to my country. My courier company said that they couldn&#8217;t transport Aerosol or contents under pressure because is a dangerous goods. I had to declare the product as abandoned, I lost my purchase. I will not be able to watch my shiny wheels, I'm sad about that, but I'm sure it's an excellent product because I have purchased other products of &#8220;Armor all&#8221; that are not dangerous goods and arrived without problems to my country where I check the good quality of their products.I purchased this fluid to use in a GM manual gearbox. Overall al I would say I am pretty happy with it.If I wanted a SILVER colored horn like in the picture I supplied, I would have bought one of those. There are many of them for less than this.Fake! I am obviously upset.** UPDATE **: So, it is Dec 2012 and I am updating this. I found this exact same horn at the local auto parts store. It was black with the red stripe, and I bought it. Got home to swap out the horns and noticed the one I got on here was an FIAMM brand. So, I would guess whoever shipped me my stuff simply sent the wrong item. I never thought to check that it was the right brand, though.I have updated my star rating to 4. Can't find myself able to give it 5.
The Battery Tender Ring Terminal Harness is very handy for charging a battery that is not easily accessible.  It allows you to install the ring terminal harness on the battery terminals once, and then just plug the extension cable into it when needing to charge or maintain the battery.The length of the harness cable to the quick-disconnect feature is adequate for easy access when needing to plug into the battery charger without having to disassemble anything on the vehicle once it is installed.  The dust cover provides protection to the quick-disconnect terminals and it keeps them from getting dirty, or wet when you are riding, driving, or boating.The Ring Terminal Harness is a very handy item for being able to quickly connect or disconnect the battery charger.These are great car battery terminal post protectors to go with the post cleaner and the Permatex sealer. ** HINT: Run jumper cables from one car battery to the battery cables of the car being cleaned, sprayed and protected so as to NOT loose electrical settings of the car one is disconnecting the cables on.Bought this in May 2012.I usually carry jumper cables in my car, but not anymore. Jumper cables: you should get a set longer than your vehicle, so you don't have to back it out of a parking spot first. Then with the longer cables, you should get the heaviest gauge wire you can or you lose power through the cables. Then of course you'll need someone with a car or truck to help you!!Solution: Booster PacI really like this battery pack compared to others.1) no unnecessary gadgets like a flashlight, air compressor or 110V AC inverter. While these are handy to have they usually are of poor quality when combined in a package like this.2) Size is great and easier to carry. While all these jumper battery packs are heavy, this one is relatively narrow in width making it easier to carry at your side with arm extended.3) Takes up little room in your trunk and can be locked up with a bicycle cable lock.4) Can be charged by your auto's 12V adapter. You have to monitor the battery's green "Charge complete" LED  because there is no automatic shutoff when the charged through the 12V outlet. This means you can overcharge it and reduce it's life and capacity.5) Use it as a power source to recharge your phone or iPad etc.Maintenance notes:Be careful using this as a power supply. The BATTERY is designed to deliver peak power to start your car. It is not designed to deliver continuous power like a car battery or battery back up.For longest battery life recharge as soon as possible after each use and at least once a month.Avoid discharging it to 50% or less as this will eventually decrease power output. Recharge as soon as possible after each use to extend it's useful lifeCons:Only 1: I don't like the AC charger. The brick gets hot and stays hot even when the charge is complete. Must be an old style transformer electric vampire.CHARGING OPTION:I recently bought a modern battery charger/maintainer for the car to top off my car battery and maintain the charge when the car sits. These chargers are not expensive for the lower current models.(about $20 on up)Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerModern chargers are designed to gently charge your battery especially from 80% to full. This charge method will extend the life of your battery and give you maximum amps when you need it. When your battery is full, they go into a Float/monitor mode.I used my new battery charger on this Booster Pac and had great results. I tested the battery Pac with a professional 100Amp battery and alternator tester. The Booster Pac tested  well within the good range which was better than charge with the supplied AC adapter.NOTE: you can use a motorcycle/car battery charger through the Booster Pac jump cables or 12V accessory plug. Both work.Fortunately I have not needed to jump a car since I bought this unit in May 2012.Would definitely buy this again.Took off 1 star for the AC charger that gets hot during and stays hot after the battery is charged. It is a potential fire hazard and wastes energy.
Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!!How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLThis thing really cleans what you do not expect do get cleaned and even with ease. Try it and you'll know what I'm talking about.
Both of my older cars had their factory nozzles falling apart thanks to arizona sun. I ordered these, funny they are same help brand sold at the zone, and installed them in 1 minute. They work great, yes you adjust them by just pushing the metal nozzle around, which you can do with factory nozzles as well. I prefer these spray pattern over factory. Factory was just like 2 streams, like a water gun, these are two fans of spray. The factory streams barely covered the window, these cover the whole thing in 2 seconds.We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.I bought 3 of the doubles first, but they were too wide for the freezer so I bought these. They come in a 3 pack, needed just one for the freezer, but the other two worked perfectly in the cabinets. The wood grained looking ones did not. I plan to purchase  a couple more packages of these.
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.
This sheepskin item could be thicker and longer. It still does what it's supposed to do though. My older one was not as long, so this one is certainly an improvement. I could not find this locally either. It's an all-natural product too. If your seatbelt bothers you, check it out.This is a nice steering wheel cover.  I'm not completely sure its leather but it feels nice.  I read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather.  I'm going to say this.  If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $20 for a product.  For that price you get what you get,  regardless of what the manufacturer may claim. Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant.  A nice cover it is.  Top grain leather it is not, at least not for $20. Want top quality?  Spend multiples of the cost of this product! !!! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap.Bought this for my Kawasaki Mean Streak. Wanted a lud horn. This one is very loud and I rate it at 3 stars only because of the tone. I order low tone but this one would be a high tone in my opinion. Sounds very sissy like, but it is loud. It would be nice to find a true horn aftermarket like the factory one. Oh well, this will work.
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.
Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect.

It took about 5 non-hurried minutes each. The old ones were held in with one screw each under the gutter's rubber trim. These are nice and big and should really cut back on the amount of black streaks.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander
Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.These work well.  Had to drill more holes because they are not a direct fit for the originals.  They look good.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.
These are the perfect size for the tires on an rv trailer - 15&#34;. I had some that were too large and didn't fit the curve of the tire so weren't very effective. These fit perfectly and hold extremely well. If you put a loop of rope through the hole, it makes it easier to remove them from under your tires.I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust.I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product.
These are good quality cloths by Meguiar's. I believe my next set will be to try the Cobra brand so I have different colors for different purposes.Required for my vehicle, I bought 8 of these for my last tuneup - they're the best product on the market as far as I'm concerned!I love these things. They could be cheaper but are still reasonable and they seem better constructed than other brands I've purchased. Excellent option for an applicator sponge.
I purchased two of these for my kids' key chains as a "back-up" (and will probably purchase a couple more).  When they arrived, I tested them on glass cola bottles, and both functioned repeatedly as they were designed to do... bottles were shattered.  These should function repeatedly until the spring wears out, so TEST THEM when you receive them, and if they fail to function... demand a replacement!Like I said, I purchased these as back-ups, not as a primary device.  Each of our vehicles have an "original hammer" either in the door pocket, center-console, or glove box (mounting them to the dash or door with the included mount is the preferred method, but why mount them when the door pocket or center console have hinged covers that will keep it from "wandering off").  If someone is trapped and cannot reach these locations, the keychain version will be a second-best option, and will always be within easy reach of the driver or passenger!You can't beat the functionality of the original hammer... NO MOVING PARTS.  I have had to use one of the original hammers to break though the rear window of a Blazer that flipped over on the Interstate in front of me several years ago.  The first guy on the scene couldn't break the glass after several attempts with a crow-bar, but my hammer shattered the glass on the first try!  The hammer worked flawlessly, and with little effort.I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.I'm hoping the quality holds up as they appear plastic and my trailer weighs  over 5000lbs and sits on a small incline.  I will correct my review if they don't work but they were a good price.
We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires.Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.They do work. Exactly as advertised.

I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous.
For my GAS engines I either purchase Bosch Premium (Black) or Purolator PLs (Yellow).  I've read that they are the same filter now.  Don't know.  What I do know is that they are both quality filters for less than $6 from Amazon.  I change them when indicated either by the manual or the driver info readout on the dash.  Never a problem.The Purolators do have the nice little texture grip, but hardly a deal breaker / maker.  These things fit and if you do a web search on filter testing, they are both consistently at the top of the ranks.Than Advance Auto Parts.  At the time I am writing this, they are $14 on Amazon for the 16 inch blades.  I just paid $18 at Advance. I know better than to not check Amazon first.  :(.  I have three of these on my windshield as I have a 2012 FJ Cruiser.I've had them about a week.  There are a couple of spots at the top of two of the blades that don't make contact with the windshield.  I'm annoyed because  Advance Auto had them billed as "The Best"  I could have done as well I think with the cheap $5 blades.  I will update after having these a few months here in Tropical Storm Florida.  Maybe they need to stretch out on my windshield for a few days.  The part that does make contact does a nice job.  And one of the blades is perfect.I do my own valves on the car. I had my heart set on an off-set type of gauge, but the dummies out there have their sizes starting off at .008. You blew it, guys. There are zillions of us out here who need that .006. Anyway, this is a nice quality basic set. Five stars: there's the little hand tight nut on the side, so you can open the whole thing and remove the ones you don't want -- to make it your custom set -- or just take the individual ones out that you want and use them loose. I like it. Another bull's eye by Amazon -- a quality tool and a bargain at that.
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark.Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors.We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks.
You get what you pay for. Compared to my friends wrap rugs I don't see these lasting very long. Our steps aren't square so the buckle up some, but do the job.A new article by consumer reports tested these all out.  The result?  Well, they simply just give you a "whiter light".  Distance wise, really don't help you see any farther.They do burn a lot hotter and I am worried about them melting the socket that plugs in the back of them, mine seemed to be a bit distorted when I removed mine.They lasted about a year and I don't drive half as much as most people.  There are better bulbs out there like the Phillips Extreme Power, put those one after these burned out and they seem a lot better, but who knows. If your bulbs are easy to change out if you are on the road and you can do them yourself and keep a cheap spare pair of bulbs in your glove compartment just in case, maybe ok, I won't buy this particular bulb anymore, would rather get the cheap Phillip 5 dollar per bulb one.But if your car has bulbs that are hard to change or you have no idea how to change your own bulbs, you are better off getting regular light bulbs that last years so you don't have to change them againWhile I see these as a good product and they do serve a very nice purpose but they are also limiting at the same time.Do they soak stuff up.. YesAre they durable.. YesAre they convenient.. yesWell what's the problem?It's the fact that you have to get them nearly soaked before you can unpack/unfold them. it seems like they are just compressed into a form and allowed to dry. You can't just get them damn and start unfolding them. Makes it pain if you don't have a bottle of water handy...On the other hand though, they do stand up to some decent abuse and I do keep a pack in the car as well as a in my camera bag and luggage. you never know when you are going to need something like this and they are small enough to simply just cut a strip or 2 or 5 and leave in a bag.also keep in mind that these aren't "towels" as we would normally think of a towel, they are more very thin cloths. not really towels...Will I buy these again:I don't really know... Depends on if I find them truly useful by the time I run out of them. I've only use a couple of them to date. So we will see how it goes.

That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.
What more can I say other than they work very well..... They beat having to remove seats and so forth to put clamps on the battery! ;-)How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOLI bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns!
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well.

These are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them.My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged.Yes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine.
I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair.Shopped around and found the best price on Amazon. This is a handy device to have around whether you own a boat or just a car. Well built and can charge anthing that has a 12V adapter..There are heavier-duty covers that would be more appropriate for daily use where you don't have protected parking (like apartments or townhouses), but I have a garage, so a cover isn't necessary at home. However, if you travel regularly, this cover is convenient to pack (it comes with it's own little storage bag), doesn't take much in the way of storage space, and is excellent protection against rain and dust when covered parking isn't available. I just added another touring bike to my garage, so this will travel with it. Do not consider using it on a bike that's being trailered, this is a very-general purpose cover, and there's too much loose material for it to be a good choice for a bike being towed at highway speeds.
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!The fender flares arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date! The passenger side front fender has a flaw in it!  The side moldings do not fit flush against the fender flares?  The only positive is that the fenders where easy to install! I would not recommend this product to other!Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror.
Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust.  Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid.  Will update with results.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector...
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change.I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work.
I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!You won't go wrong using this if you follow the directions. This is a great way to bring in some upper cyl. lubrication without messing with outboard oil mixes.One thing I've found is my old Chevy runs a bit better on this this.This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderI bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.Very easy to work with.  I reconditioned my emergency battery that was beginning to get weaker.  I also reconditioned my auto battery on my 15 year old car (the battery is about 5 years old).When using is I recommend you plug it into a powerstrip that has a on/off switch.  You need to connect the unit to the battery and to avoid sparks it help to make the connection with the power switch off, then turn it on when everything is set.Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again,
I got this an an extra after i Damaged the original and as expected it is a perfect fit!.  Good to have a spare sometimes!!!!.Bought this to allow the use of the std Tender for an outside car, run this from the garage to the driveway, works just the way it is supposed to...This product brings back the depth to an aging vehicle but it is not for the weak in the arm.  It does take hours to claybar your vehicle.  Upside; you can see the difference once you complete the process.
Does a fine job. Only had to do it once last season.  We'll see how it works on a full seasonbought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.
2007 F=150 Ford Pickup (Triton V-8).  No tether without you rigging it but it does the job.  Depends on what you want.  I'm happy.Update 02/10/2014Has proven to function tho sometimes finicky on the relock and after use seems somewhat flimsy.  I probably will replace with a metal one somewhere along the line (if available) and am lowering my original rating from five to three stars accordingly.At least my car was in the driveway when it decided not to start so it wasnt too bad. I am now searching on amazon for one with higher than 400 power.It would not start my six cylinder engine on my crossfire. I think it will be ok in the other vehicles that have four cylinders. No way this would ever start a V8. It was fully charged just not enough oomph. The K&K; models look interesting but I am not excited about having to tend them while they are charged to prevent damage. Unit does work well for powering less taxing things though and the pump works well, just wont start your car if you have a six cylinder or up.In the end just used them for mobile compressor to air up tires until they all diedHope this helps.I use the rear wiper in my 05 Dodge Magnum every day and this blade does the job. Nothing fancy but not high end by any means. Will buy again.
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle.Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara. Simple install. Does what it is suppose to do.I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.
No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.I purchased a Battery Tender unit last year, and needed to replace my ring harness. The price was great and the product matched by battery tender. Item was shipped fast and packaged well.The filter arrived when expected.  It was exactly as represented.  It fit perfectly.  Installation instructions were very helpful.  Same quality I would have received had I paid more.

Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW ownersHad to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality!This is an exceptional Tire Repair Kit.  I used to to fix my flat tire.  My tire is still holding strong after 3 weeks.  I would recommend this product to everyone.
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.This filter combined with an Airaid MRT helped my 2004 Tahoe make a little more power and sound like it has a V8 under the hood! The filter fit nicely and should provide plenty of filtration for this daily driver.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.
I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem.Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change.

Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800FWorks perfect for what it is designed for. We bought this for the bumper on our travel trailer. It was a breeze to install and holds up very well. Most times we just use it for a 4 bike rack but I have used it a couple of times to pull or 3 person Kawasaki Jetski as well (~1,000 lbs). I would definately recommend this to anyone.This tube is probably large enough for 5-10 brake jobs. I used this product when replacing the front rotors and pads on my 1999 Toyota Corolla about 2 weeks ago without any problems.
Well, it's a spark plug socket, right? So, either it works or it don't, right?  Well, this one works OK.  Just have to be careful in that in trying to remove the plugs, it might have a tendency to slip off of your socket wrench.  Other than that, it seems to be pretty good quality and works fine.changed engine oil on my equinox. just make sure it will work on your type of car. other wise it will give you pain like one of my friends. when it works, it is super cool. not a single drop of oil on the floor.This wax goes on easy but you will get a work out taking it off but that will pay off, this wax will last for a while. I have applied it several months ago and the water still beeds up like I waxed it last week.  I used a electric buffer to take it off that will make it easier on you.
If you own a Hi-Lift, I may suggest to have this repair kit. You don't know when you will have to use it.If you ride around the roads of south Florida then you need this product in your tires. You will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! It worksAnother of the must haves for RV-ing, If you don't have it when you need it, you will be sorry.'

Nice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps.Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter.This thing really cleans what you do not expect do get cleaned and even with ease. Try it and you'll know what I'm talking about.

Just don't plan to pull it out when the tires are resting against it - the grips really dig in and with 2 on the axle and a slight grade they work perfectly.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.I have a 2005 Suzuki C50 Cruiser (700lbs 93") and this cover does cover the bike without its hard bags attached. It does have multi-bars on it, which to are covered.  The bottom half of both tires are exposed.  I am able to connect the front bungee, but the middle one has to attach to the bike frame, as it will not reach to the hole on the opposite side of the bike.It has been raining for the last couple of days, so I plan to go check it out in a few more days, as it is expected to rain through tomorrow.I will adjust my review if there was any issue with wind and/or upper portion of bike getting wet or dusty despite the cover being in place.For now, I do suggest picking this up, as the price-is-right.
Easy to adjust and manuever.  I bought these for my antique travel camper and they work perfectly.  They store easily and work efficiently.These work on my 2012 F150. They fit perfectly with no vibration at all. An excellent product and I highly recommend them!Bought these for my 29ft travel trailer.  They have held up for 3 yrs of camping so far.  Would definately recommend.
bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps.I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.

Needed a small dielectric grease tube and this fit the bill. Just used it today on some outdoor electronics to seal it up and it should last a long time.Will work great for what I bought it for.Haven't used it yet and will post if it turns out to be a pos.Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though.

Bought this to allow the use of the std Tender for an outside car, run this from the garage to the driveway, works just the way it is supposed to...I use this for my hi-lift, just as nature intended. As advertised, it keeps the jack handle isolated and free from noise while driving. Keep in mind, when it comes time to use the jack, you will need to unbolt the chain mount typically placed on top of the jack to remove the handle isolator completely, which is a bit of a nuisance. Still though, this is an essential part for anyone with a Hi Lift jack.As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!  The AC power supply works as advertised but the inverter cooling fan is rather noisy.  You can hear it from one room of the house to the other.  The LED light is smart as LEDs use very little energy.  There are consistent complaints about the air compressor taking forever to inflate a tire.  The problem is not in the air compressor but the little black nipple at the end of the house.  One must, with the lever first up, push the inflation fitting all the way onto the tire valve stem by twisting the fitting and gently pushing until  you can see none of the brass fittings and then push down the lever to connect the hose and open the valve on the valve stem.  If you do this correctly, you will see the actual tire pressure currently in the tire on the air pressure gauge.  If the air hose fitting is not on the valve stem properly, when you turn on the inflator, the air pressure will initially say 0 psi until you turn on the pump and then the pressure will jump up to 100psi.  What is happening in this situation, is that the air compressor is trying to push against a closed valve.  It will VERY SLOWLY push air into the tire.  Make sure you have the fitting right and it will work very quickly.  Black and Decker should put a better air hose fitting on the end of the hose to eliminate this issue.As stated, everything works.  Ultimately, I will use the dc receptacles to charge the device via solar panels through a charge controller.Update as of 9/19/2009I have had this unit for some time now and have been charging it via the 12 volt cigarette lighter with a small 30 watt array using two Sunforce 15watt panels in parallel.  I use a Sunforce 7 amp charge controller to protect the battery in the device. I can easily charge this unit in about 6 hours from a depleted point at which the inverter auto shut off to protect the battery the night before.  I get 5 to 6 hours of light from a standard torche lamp in my living room with a 23 watt cfl installed.  I recently started charging it in parallel with a old jump starter pack I had been given as an anniversary gift at a job. If I am only using 6 hours of the sun, I am not storing all the energy I can.I now run the Electromate in the living room for about 5 hours to power the lamp and the Jump start pack gets a 75 watt inverter plugged into it and I run an identical setup upstairs in my computer room.I want backup power in an emergency and a very good way to get the bugs out is to use it continually so the problems will pop up at I time when I don't really need emergency power, instead of at the most inopportune time.

These K&N; Filters are not made in the USA to my surprise.  They are made in Thailand.I probably won't buy K&N;'s anymore.

We were in need of replacement awning pull strap and figured this would be a good brand.No problems with the length or the strap, the t slider piece however could be a little stifferand thicker to give a solid feel.  As it it does work fine I just worry that the strap willpull out of the awning slot.It is a cheap steel receiver tow hook.  Nothing more.A retainer clip to keep the strap in the hook should have been included at the very least.  Otherwise any slack might make your tow strap pop out, or worse yet, stab your strap over the end of the hook and rip it.I have done a lot of pulling, vehicle recovery, and off-road driving.  I've seen every scary, unimaginable tow method.  And, I've seen people use things that were not designed for pulling like cables and chains.  Misuse of these items can seriously injure and kill people, as well as do major damage to vehicles.  Because, when you put thousands of pounds of stress on a tow line and suddenly it breaks or lets loose, it shoots straight back in the opposite direction and will go RIGHT THROUGH windshields, radiators, plastic, sheet metal, and BYSTANDERS.If you want something to keep in your trunk in case you ever get stuck in a ditch, or if you even THINK you're an off-roader gearing up for the trail, DON'T BUY THIS.Frame mounted clevis points are the safest bet.  But, if you don't have that luxury at least buy a receiver CLEVIS mount with a closed eye and a screw-pin clevis.Other safety advice from experts:Only use a soft nylon tow strap rated at least twice your vehicle's weight.Never use a strap with built-in hooks or metal eyelets.Never use chain.Never use wire rope cable.I knew the dangers when I bought it.  But I'm not using it for towing or emergency recovery.  And I know how to and not to use it.Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.
This thing is pretty basic. You essentially create a girth hitch with it. You pass the strap around an object, then you take the standing part of the strap and grab a loop of it and pass it through the sewn loop at the tag end of the strap. Then you slide this thing between the standing part and the sewn loop, and when you tighten the strap, the bone prevents the standing part from sliding back through the sewn loop, essentially creating a knot. Any sailer will be familiar with this system it's used alot in quick release knots.I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet.

The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...This is very well made and hopefully holds up to the sun which usually discolors the plate covers. Can't complain on the Bell cover so far.
Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece.After owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!!Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good Luck
they are light and smaller than you would expect, but they work fine and store easy as they fit into one another (stackable)just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you didI love Lynx products, these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do. I would buy again.
The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights.Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.
Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems.They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.

I just used these pads for under my stabilizer jacks (see picture).  They work as described for my RV trailer.  Sturdy, hard plastic with a flat side and an indented, grid on the other side.  The velcro strap holds them together nice and neat.  I'm not sure these would work for motorhome jacks, however.  They work great for me.i bought these for my rv trailer. They are too flimsy and thin for the weight ofmy trailer and the do not fit well under the tires. the lip is guess you would call it is too thing to fit snug in place. there is no string to help you remove or pull them away when packing up. i am buying a different set.The tires say 300 pound capacity and maybe that is what the rubber could support on a static load but these seem to be medium duty wheels. I purchased these wheels to replace the plastic wheels on a 5 HP chipper/shredder that weighs about 100 pounds and I tow behind a lawn tractor. For my application these wheels work well. The bearings are exposed and it seems that dust, dirt and water can get into the races. The metal wheel parts seem to be thin and I do notice that both have a slight wobble in them. For medium duty applications like my chipper it is ok. I would also use these wheels on my garden wagon and 5K watt generator. I would not use these wheels on a ride on mower that had to support my weight. I would use these wheels on the front free floating deck of my ride on mower.  A grease zerk fitting would have been nice on these wheels.
Pros:Generous supply in 32 oz bottleWorks in fuel or mixed with engine oilSmells pleasant (minty, clean)Keeps cold engine start-ups slick and quickCons:Thin lubricantThins out your oilIt is a solvent, it MIGHT (no facts to support that possibility yet) deteriorateyour gaskets, seals.Claims:Cleans out engine, plugs, valves, and injectorsMY recommended use:8 - 10 oz per oil change(they recommend 20% mmo with engine oil change. That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off.When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine.If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself.
This is a great little unit.  Using it to charge a 18 amp hour SLA for a portable device.  Have been using it for a month now with no complaints.  Would recommend for same type of use.This is pretty much a complete car kit for cleaning a car.I use Meguiar's product often for waxing and detailing my autos.I especially like using detailing wax because of the shine and easeof shining the whole car in a short period.I would recommend this kit for anyone that takes pride in their ride.Complete Microfiber Towels Car Kit - 2 All Purpose Microfiber Towels - 1 Microfiber Towel For Streak Free Glass- For Home Or Auto - 2 Ultra Plush 16 by 24 Microfiber Auto Detailing Towels - 1 Auto Dust Pad For Home Or AutoThis polish, paired with the Number 26 wax gives an incredible result.  Highly recommended for a phenomenally deep shine. Serious depth
California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***In a nutshell:Mos cars use 5 quarts, so why selling 4? And then for more than what you pay at most other places?Mobil 1 must have listened, WM is selling 1 gallon jugs now (5 quarts) for less than twenty-five, and a single quart is less than seven. Beats all car places, and they change the oil for you as well.
Works really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored.This couldn't be simpler...put it at the bottom of your wash bucket, and as you rinse the dirt off your sponge/mitt/brush/whatever, it sinks to the bottom, under the Grit Guard where it can't get back on your car. I might be paranoid, but sometimes I do find quite a bit of dirt and grit near the bottom of my wash water...now I don't worry as much about these particles somehow acting like sandpaper against my car's finish.Only drawback is that it doesn't fit smaller buckets.Definitely recommended to anyone fanatical about keeping the car finish pristine.This has a lot of uses beyond car applications. I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound. I used a sheet of it inside a computer case, to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on. You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess. It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover, and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind. So, choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down!
Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.
I did not receive what is shown in the picture.  It does not have the two round lids that turn on top, but rather a hinged lid held by two thumb screws.  Doesn't really matter, as it works just the same.  This is a nice cover, and I'm happy with it.  It looks better than the one it replaced.This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as "simple", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different.as noted in the title, the bar is solid.  the lock body is some sort of resin (?) which seems like a good blow with a solid hammer could break apart.  The lock mechanism itself is decent and the unit functions just fine.  i just don't think it is worth the cost.  If buying one again, i would choose a more durable product for the price.  It looks solid from a distance and perhaps that serves as a deterrent too.
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...it works as advertised and is keeping the hard water stains off of the shower. it says good for 1 season so i am not sure how long that is. we shall see.Like the shine so far, will see how long it lasts, one week so far and water is still beading off the car
I purchased this harness with a 2 position battery tender thinking the tender wouldn't come with 2 connectors. I was wrong and the tender came with 2 connectors. This is exactly the same as the OEM ones and I have not needed to use it yet.This tender answers a problem that I have had for several years. How to charge more than one battery at a time with only 1 outlet available for use in my garage.Works great and I really like the plug in adapters. They are the standard SAE type plug. This charger simply plugged into my bikes, since I have been using these adapters all along. (This charger comes with 2 adapters that have eyes that you hook up directly to your battery post screws/bolts, and 2 alligator clips that simply clip on to the battery posts. Both styles are fuse protected with a standard 7.5A ATO bladed fuse).After owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!!
These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.Best price on the internet&#8230;.worked great on gear oil replacement for my F-150 2001 axle.  Last time it will need to be replacedI bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!No, I wouldn't use this to power a generator from 12' from my vehicle so my kids could play XBox...but it works perfectly well in my application. I run a 12V air compressor mounted in my truck with this from a standard 12V socket in my Mustang. It has never let me down, blown a fuse, or caused any weird power spikes/drops. It serves its purpose well!I bought this as an extension cord from my pop up camper battery to the inside of my camper. I hooked up a 200watt inverter on the other side. Good, low guage wire.
Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellneeded to order one smaller item to get free shipping, and have a motorcycle that will need an oil change soon, so it fit both needs
not sure what to say - can't make too much of a review on this...the wires provided a proper connection and works. Bought this to replace the one I lost.Used on a 2005 Suzuki SV non-fairing. Hides pretty well, just tuck it away behind the engine mount.This hose does what you need it to do -- DO NOT USE A GARDEN HOSE for potable water! This one is designed to SAFELY deliver water to the RV. HOWEVER, use a filter from the source point OR prior to entry point into the RV. Also, never connect to Black or Gray tank and then use with the potable intank connection. I store this hose in its own White trash bag to know I've packed it.Purchased this to replace missing cap on RV.  Works as expectedbut would like to see bigger nubs or perhaps 2 wings to makethis a little easier to put on and remove.
I've owned Xantrex and Duracell jump starters in the past. Unlike those and similar products, the JNC does only one thing and does it really well -- starts engines like a champ. For the equivalent starting power in one of the multifunction Chinese-made products, you'd need to buy a bigger and heavier power pack for considerably more money.I've used the 300XL to start 4-, 6- and 8-cylinder engines. It had no problem with any of them. Starting a 4-cylinder engine is so effortless, I imagine I could start a whole parking lot row of them with one charge. The vehicle I actually carry the jump starter around in is a 2007 Lincoln Town Car with a big V8 engine. One night, my alternator died and the battery drained completely before the car finally went dead on the highway. Not only did I start the engine with the JNC 300XL, but I left it connected and used it to power the car while I drove it to my all-night mechanic (with the headlights off). This drained it flat, so I recharged it as soon as I could and it was fine.There's no AC inverter in this product, but the flashlight attachment pops out to reveal a 12V socket that you can use to power/recharge laptops, mobile phones and suchlike. I use to to power my air compressor to inflate tires. Speaking of which, I have a really good compressor that I bought using the money I saved by purchasing the JNC instead of a multifunction power pack, which would have included a really cheap air compressor made out of plastic parts.I bought this version over the plastic version because you can connect any type of air compressor to it. The adapter is the same kind as used in car and bicycle tires.I used it last weekend to clear the water lines of my travel trailer and it worked as advertized.I initially was going to just use a bicycle pump to push the water out, but I managed to borrow an air compressor at the last minute. I blew the lines for about 30 minutes and then pumped in some RV antifreeze as recommended by my trailer manufacturer.Even though you'll only use this adapter once a year, I would recommend this over the plastic version because it should last a lifetime.The Key Vault appears to be well made, with very little plastic.  Being concerned about rust (which may or may not be a problem), I put a little bit of Teflon oil on the inside of the two sliding retainers that hold the two pins in, as well as a drop on the two latch points before installing.  This way, if it does get some rust, it will have less of a chance of seizing up.  Long term instead of oil, I'd probably recommend a small amount of Teflon based grease where the pin contacts the two sliders, as well as on where the sliders contact the inner wall.  Since the drawer walls are high, the oil isn't going to come into contact with the contents.  I'd probably consider a drop of oil on the spring in the back that pushes the drawer out when the right combination is entered and the lever pulled.I easily changed the combination and had no problems whatsoever installing it.  Time will tell if it gets water into the drawer, but so far, it looks decently water resistant.  I personally am not worried about water getting in the drawer.As for people being able to tell it is there, the only real way someone can find it is if they examine the hitch pins and notice that it isn't a standard hitch lock, or pull off the dust cover.If someone had to place a spare key on a vehicle, this is the most secure solution for this answer.  Of course, a thief who has some power tools can get into it, as well as someone sitting there flipping through 10,000 combinations.If someone is worried that keeping a spare key in this would be a security issue, you can do the following which an acquaintance of mine does:  Keep a "dummy" key in the Hitch Safe that will open the door.  Then inside the vehicle, use a console or other strongbox with a stout lock store in there a spare key that works in the ignition.  This way, for a thief to steal the vehicle, they would have to either break out the Hitch Safe, then try drilling out a heavy steel enclosure for the ignition key, or break the windows and try to get into the console safe.  Either way, eventually a thief would prevail, but it will take a lot of time and noise.  For all but the most crime-plagued areas, the Hitch Safe appears good enough -- it keeps all but the dedicated thieves with hand/power tools away.
Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.My Miata actually takes the HP-1008 which is slightly shorter in length. I prefer this one because it is the same spec's with more capaciaty and I can use a standard wrench instead of a filter wrench inside the tight engine bay. I've been using K&N filters on my Honda cars and Miata for years. Top quality and Amazon gives me the best price.I have a 2013 SUV which has problems maintaining a battery charge for more than a few days. Lexus supplied a non-waterproof, but more powerful Battery Tender. Problem is that I park the vehicle outside, so I bought this model. It charges and maintains the battery, but to reach full charge takes about 1 1/2 times longer than the one with the Lexus label. By the way, the Lexus model is just a re-labeled Battery Tender, as is the re-labeled BMW model I also have.
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as wellThese will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep?This stuff works. Had a flat in the middle of no where and this got me back on the trail. Works simply. You will need a valve core removal tool and a air compressor. I purchased a &#34;KIT&#34; that has everything you need. Purchased this bottle of &#34;Slime&#34; so incase I get another flat, I will have some. Just a heads up, this is meant at a temporary fix to get you to a repair place. Will last a while.
This is a pretty simple, cheap compressor.  As others have said, you can take it out of the housing and turn it into a compact compressor that you can store easily.  Especially useful for motorcycles.  Don't try to use it on the battery without turning on the engine though.  You might end up draining your battery.I attach it to a gauge that has a passthrough valve and can check tire pressure and fill up easily before going out for a ride.  Since it's always best to do the tires before you start riding on them, this works out well for me.Accu Gage Air Check Inflate TiresIs the gauge I useI use it on a 17 foot Boston Whaler.  I connected it directly to the battery so I can use spot lights, other lighting, charge cell phones, etc.  Can't get any simpler.  Basically a piece of useful junk.  Recommend it.You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness.
Use this for my kc offroad lights on a mule utv.  Replaced one bad bulb that would come on/off.  Worked as expected.  Nice and bright.Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine!Bought this for our 2003 BMW R 1150R.Even as a female I understand that Mobil 1 is THE standard for synthetic, and we would never buy another brand for any of our engines.
These bulbs are fantastic! They aren't "blue" at all. Instead they are pure white. If you look at the bulbs when they're turned on, they give a tiny hint of blue, but the light they emit is completely pure white. They light up the road VERY well and reflect much better off objects than my previous stock halogens. A VERY good buy!!Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are.They were easy to install and improve the look of the plain lights. They appear well-constructed and should last a while.
I purchased 1 of these to tow my 16 ft camper from Northern New England to Florida this past Spring. You can buy 2 of them and use them for extra protection. I didn't need to do more than 1 as my camper is about 1600 lbs...It took me some driving and stopping to ask others why I didn't feel my sway bar was working to understand I was using it wrong.I had the sway bar to tight. The handle is very easy to turn and you can feel when it gets taunt. Over tightening it will defeat the purpose of using this item. It is NOT a stabilizer bar..it's a sway bar.. took me a while to get it...I prefer to have the sway bar for my small camper..plus it's easy to remove or even loosen..which you really have to do to turn around in tight spaces. The thing will screech as you turn! The sway bar is sup to allow your camper to do some sway just not very much sway. if you over tighten it, it will not work properly..when the wind hits you, both the camper and the car will feel the pull back and forth.. you don't want that.. you want the camper to be able to have some sway with the wind. This product is great because you can adjust the amount of tension for low winds/high winds. GREAT PRODUCT!I am not a good mechanic, I don't even pretend to play one on TV. Mostly I am somebody who is sick of paying $80 to the local mechanic to find out the gas cap is cracked or some $10 part needs to be replaced. I finally decided to buy a code scanner to facilitate my repair efforts.---THE GOOD STUFF---* The unit worked right out of the box on both my 2006 Subaru Outback and my 2002 Jeep GC. The hardest part of the whole deal was finding the port on the Subaru. (Tip-look under the hood release).* There seems to be a whole INNOVA website that they want you to go to for help translating the numeric codes into English. So far typing every code I have seen into Google has brought back more information than I know how to use. Not sure how this works for more serious mechanics who might need access to technical bulletins, but for us Saturday morning driveway hackers, it is fine.* The unit seems reasonably well made, although not sure it would stand up to the day-to-day use of a professional. For us "couple times a year" mechanics, it seems fine.---THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF---* There are no directions included, only a CDROM. The CD doesn't even have the directions, but points you to a website. Actually it doesn't even do that, instead it loads an application onto your computer and the app has a link built into it to get you to the website. Kind of convoluted and time wasting.* Plugging the scanner into your USB port kicks off the loading of a driver. No warning, and no idea what it loaded. I hate that.* The box could really do with a quick-start guide. Really all you need to know is how to plug it in, when to power (not start) the vehicle, and what the little buttons do. Would fit on an index card. Instead it is a 15 minute software deal.---SUMMARY---It seems fine for what I want it to do, namely just scan codes quickly. The whole PC/CDROM could have just as soon been skipped. For my use, no reason at all to plug it into the computer, and the installed app just looks like trouble.Ideally a quick-start guide, or better yet, some abbreviated instructions printed on the back, would have made this so much easier for a first time scanner user. That is the reason for the 4 stars and not 5.No idea how robust the unit is, or how long it will last, but I will probably lose it or drop it before it "wears out".Replacement for a 2006 Vespa GT200.  Shipped dry, with the acid in bottles.  You should be mechanical enough to be able to follow detailed instructions on how to remove the covers and fill the battery.  Please WEAR SAFETY GLASSES and GLOVES!  Do this OUTSIDE and have a water hose near bye &#34;just in case&#34;.... you don't want to accidentally spill or splash the acid on your skin!  Now that your scared... don't worry, it really is easy to do, just do it safely.  The last battery I bought was also a Yuasa and it was still going strong at 3 years.  I replaced it... &#34;just to be on the safe side&#34;.  Motorcycle/scooter batteries should generally be replaced every year, or 2 at the most.  I was pushing really pushing it at 3.
Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's.Great for a 3" wide receiver for Tacoma or Tundra. It can be hard to find a hitchpin that is for a wider/reinforced receiver. This works well with some small room to spare. Highly recommend.Motorcycle Consumer News rated this unit very highly.  It is intended to be used for emergencies on the side of the road.  It IS NOT intended to be a pump to use everyday for inflating tires.  I would recommend that it be used exclusively for motorcycles and bicycles.
Bought this to use with an air compressor. I didn't want to risk shorting out a fuse using the compressor in the cigarette lighter in the car.This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor.I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it!
California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).This Duracell "Powerpack 600" works well to jump start cars (we have used it twice now) and as a portable AC source while camping (used it twice on extended trips). We bought this to replace an olderXantrex XPower Powerpack 400 Plus Portable Backup Power Sourcethat no longer holds a charge after six years. This Duracell unit has more "cranking" power and also powers my electronics longer when camping, so I am pleased with the general performance.We have also used the AC output to power a GPS enabled telescope and it easily lasted for the three hours or so we were in the field.My major issues with this are relatively minor, but worth mentioning. The charging adapter does not store in the unit, the clock can not be disabled, and the radio quality is marginal (picks up very few stations compared to my other radios).This is was a good choice for me since the positives outweigh the few negatives for my uses.Recommended!CFHI like this kit a lot!It comes with 2 bigs bars of clay, think double the size of the Meguiars kit.A bottle of detail spray and a average quality microfiber cloth.I used autowash soap/water as a lube for the clay, did a great job on my 7 yr old van, I only washed it in 7 yrs....the paint is now smooth as a baby's bum, waxed it....My kids were wondering why the van was sooo slippery smooth and shineyI saved the detail spray to keep my cars looking tip top after washes.Great price here at Amazon, will keep buying it here.

The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers...Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured.
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off.I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them)..Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank.
I just received this awesome jump start.  I have a Vector that is in its tenth year, so I wanted to have the replacement in place.  This is one solid piece of equipment.  It was fairly well charged when I opened the package.  Now I know why the auto dealers and pros reach for this jumper - it is all business!  Oh, there is the $75.00 Coupon Enclosed...with no time limit - priceless!  This is Made in the U.S.A. I researched all that was out there, and Amazon always has the best deal.I picked this up as a Lighting Deal and it has not disappointed. Great digital gauge if that is what you are looking for in a tire gauge.This stuff is amazing this is my third bottle of this product and I have to say it is the best quick detailer, in between washes this product brings the mirror like shine right back to where it should be.
I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months.This is a very nice charger and does an adequate job of charging my motorcycle battery.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 as at times it will indicate that the battery is charging, but then I turn it on and off within 10 seconds then the charger indicates the battery is charged.  My last shumacher (that lasted 3 years in my garage) never did this.I'll start this review by being very upfront.  I like my car to look NICE, but I don't like doing the work involved with making it look like that.  Luckily, my husband has always dutifully waxed all of our vehicles, even though he had never particularly enjoyed the job either.  So, this review is pretty much based on his experiences.  He's not a computer sort of guy though, so it's up to me to do the review.  =)Last summer our neighbor (who has an obsession with washing/waxing his vehicles), told my husband about this Ice Liquid Polish.  Since my car was due for waxing, hubby went off to the local Wally World to buy a bottle.  I think he paid $16-$17 for it, and it included a sponge applicator and a small microfiber towel.Now, washing and waxing a car is normally a 1/2 day project for my hubby.  About 40 minutes after he pulled my car out of the garage to wash and wax it (with the Ice), he came back into the house, plopped on the couch and turned on the game.  I assumed he was tired and taking a break before he finished the car up.  Much to my suprise, I found out he was completely finished...including cleaning my (pain in the butt) multi-spoked wheels.Since then, he makes it a point to wax my car with the Ice about every 2 months...simply because it doesn't take very long.  The bottle, is still between 2/3 to 3/4 full, after 4 wax jobs.  Granted, my car is pretty small (Chrysler Crossfire SRT-6), but it looks like this bottle is going to last for at least 12-14 waxes.  That works out to about $1.20 per wax job.Besides the benefit of getting my car waxed now on a more frequent basis, I like the fact that this doesn't leave a white residue on the trim of the car.  Hubby was always really bad about doing this with the previous types of wax he used, and my car would look sloppy as a result.So why did I give this 4 stars instead of 5?  There is a downside...it isn't long lasting.  According to Turtle Waxes own website ( [...] it will bead water and shine for at least 3 to 4 months under normal weather conditions.  The website also says to apply Ice at least 4 times a year to keep the finish protected.  Luckily, my hubby hasn't had a problem with applying this pretty often, but it is disconcerting that the product only lasts for an average of 3 months.I don't drive my Crossfire in the winter months (it is garaged), but I personally wouldn't rely on this particular product in the harsh winter driving months.  But for a car like mine, which is garaged in the winter and never sees salt, it seems to be a good and convenient product.
While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.The overall length is 16 inches. About 4 inches for the handle. So yes there are plenty of bristles to clean the wheel. Finally, I can clean my Dodge Charger 5 spokes wheels perfectly. It reaches everywhere. And that seller sells it for less than another one on Amazon sold as a "16 inch" brush. Well this one is also 16 inches and it is Prime eligible. I wish I had that brush years ago. Give it a try.
I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose, so I returned it and got this.  A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge "back in the day" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a "dual chuck" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels.What can you say except that it holds a lot and has a big opening. The lid doesn't have a gasket so don't tilt or turn over. the only other small gripe is the hinge on the lid hits the handle and will probably help the fatigue factor
This is one other item you need for your Hi-Lift jack. This allows you to lift curved bumpers, or ones without notches in them specifically for this type of jack. Great small accessory that goes well with the jack itself. Heavy duty and will last many years. I did modify this with some rubber to not mar metal finish of my bumpers though. If you have plastic bumpers, don't use this, it will leave marks. A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained. Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid. This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material. Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job. I added larger ones that are stronger, but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading. You need this for your jack. Will help with some fence posts of odd shape as well.I wanted to get this because I seem to be the only "car guy" in the household and amongst extended family (some 20+ people all in Dallas).I do all of my own car work, and could easily do simple battery voltage checks with a multimeter, but a device like this is important, because it measures amps correctly (and simply), something you don't want to do with most multimeters without calculating the proper size resistor to use inline or risk frying your multimeter.  Basically, this is a device designed to measure automotive voltage, plus check cold cranking amps, cranking amps, and load testing.The 3 stars is mainly for the usability.  First, the display (the most important thing!) is hard to read because it uses large LED bars to write out the words.  Let me explain - the first test is the battery test.  When you select the battery test, it reads "baFF" rather than "batt" only because the manufacturer chose to use a very simplistic display that doesn't have enough "bars" to create easy to read words.  It's like trying to make words with a calculator if that makes any sense.  (I will try to upload a picture later)Next, of all devices that truly need a carrying case, this one does, if only to hold the instruction manual.  It is not intuitive to use without the manual (primarily because the words are very hard to decipher or read).  There's a "glossary" on the back, but it doesn't include everything, nor the steps for each of the tests, if it DID, I would've added 1 more star.Then, on top of that, the manual somewhat confuses you a little in determining what type of battery you have.  For example, for battery types you must choose from the following:SLI - Starting/Lighting/Ignition Flooded batteryFLAT - Traditionally shaped AGM batteriesSPL - AGM-designated spiral wound batteriesGEL - Gel cell batteriesNow of the 4, what type of battery do you have???  I checked 3 cars and none have any of this written on the battery themselves.  I can only assume SLI makes the most sense.  Ideally, this would be explained a little better or use "Conventional, Marine/Deep-Cycle, Maintenance Free" wording instead.Overall, I feel 3 stars is fair for the usability - the item still works and seems to validate known good and known bad batteries and charging systems, but don't lose the instruction manual and good luck being able to read the too-simplistic screen.The problem with finding suitable spark plugs for your vehicle is that other than the OEM that comes with your car, the quest is trial and error,  some may say they're the best, then you put them in your car and they don't do their job... so it's all trial and error, once you find the ones that work, stick to those.some tips i can give are the following... search on the web for previous owner experiences to make a big picture of what you ought to be looking for; ALWAYS gap the plugs as specified in your car manual or the suggested gap by the spark plug brand for your car;  use correct and equal torque when installing all plugs on all cylinder heads.Ive heard a rule ... if your car is jap, buy jap plugs (denso, ngk) if your car is american, buy american (champion, autolite), if your car is euro, buy euro plugs (bosch)NGK iridium are great buy, excellent quality and performance and fairly priced.
What else can you ask for? 3 Ton and light weight plus locking mechanism is way safer than the wedge cuts in regular ramps.I suggest that they cover the top with a rubber pad or silicon piece to help protect car and standThe install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.
Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle.Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.

Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.
Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.I'm prepared to jump a car when the battery is dead whenever it occurs, in any weather conditions and for any size engine.  This battery weighs almost 29 pounds.  We keep it fastened to 300 pound capacity multipurpose 2-wheel dolly.  I keep the heavy jumper cables that came with the unit on that dolly.  That's been doing the trick.  I don't use it for anything else.  We've kept the DC charging cable in the accessory bag.Because of our insurance, we keep our instructions attached to the dolly with a laminated sheet.  This includes warnings about making sure the area around the battery is well-ventilated, not to allow flame near it, not to touch a metal tool simultaneously to the positive and negative cables ends, remover personal items such as rings, watches and any metal from your hand or wrist, remove positive terminal first and avoid touching eyes when working with it.  The instructions give the whole sequence for jumping a vehicle engine and also instructions for recharging with the AC charger.This battery has protection against overheating or a surge.  It comes with a replaceable fuse that protects against reverse polarity and short circuits.  You can read the battery's charge status on the digital display as well as output information in green.  You have the battery's charge percentage light.  And the charging status light is on when it's plugged in, flickering when it's charging and remaining green once fully charged.  When the battery is fully charged, you get a very useful incandescent light that lasts a very long time too.  It has 3 AC Outlets for supplying the 120 V of AC power, but it still takes hours to power up.  The instructions say it can take up to 35 hours if it's fully discharged.One thing I didn't need is the radio or alarm clock.  This will be important if you take the battery into the wilderness with you, not as I use it.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit.Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth.

Once you set the leveling height, place a chock and roll the camper up onto the leveler. (A cap will give a nice flat surface for the camper tire.) The chocks &#34;lock&#34; into the levelers and allow ease of placing the camper tire on top of the leveler without going too far in either direction. I have found the Lynx Leveling System to be an absolute must and time saver.An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.
Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed.I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost.Once you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it.
First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that.I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater, as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location.  If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense, let me save you the time -- in my case, the better part of an afternoon.First, a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play: 1) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater, 2) a secondary plug that screws into the first, and 3) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water.  I believe the intent of this design is to allow &#34;regular&#34; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve, while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly (due to the larger diameter).  Sidenote: opening the actual valve (the smallest component) drains the tank very, very slowly, and sometimes only at a trickle if you can't get air behind the water -- in my case, I had to open the pressure relief valve (in addition to all faucets) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking, the other components did.  I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape, and at various depths.  No matter what the combination, there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces.  There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking.  I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape (5+ wraps), to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering, returned the valve to Amazon, and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug.  Hint: Sears sells a 15/16 offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs.
If you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is, always non-functional.  this conncetor works and holds the flat 4 wire firmly.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.If you want this in chrome type the letter C infront of it in your search.  I love the welded nut option it is a life saver for motorcycles or small engine bays.
The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth?This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare?  No way.Because of the chemicals used, the old fashioned pyrotechnic flares are hard to find.  You might find a 3 pack at the local auto store or order a 50 pack box from the distributor via truck shipment, but few mail order houses want to deal with the shipping requirements for the flammable goods and oxidizers.Enter the LED flare.  This product has one bright LED that when the button is pressed once, it flashes.  It's bright in one direction, but not nearly as bright as a burning flare.  The magnet is quite powerful - I figured it would be little more than a refrigerator magnet but it grabbed onto my car quite well.As a map light, it's not really usable since maps have colors used and this is monochromatic light.  Also the directional led and lens in front of it form a 1/2" x 3" strip of red light on paper with the second press of the light button.  The 3rd press turns it off.To ensure it's ready to use, I'd recommend storing the batteries externally.  Also remember to gain anyone's attention you'll need to aim it into their eyes.With just one red LED it's not that bright - I've seen much better 12V LED arrays on amazon that are placed into a reflector and spread left, straight on, and right for a much brighter, and wider beam.Because of the dim output, and lack of usability as a map light, plus trying to replace a 15 minute pyrotechnic flare that you can not look at due to the brightness with one red led I am giving the product just 3 stars.  It's pushing a 2 star product.
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom.First, this is a great unit and rock solid at brake control.  I upgraded from a Tekonsha Prodigy.  It's Simple!  Just removed the older unit (Prodigy) from it's existing bracket, unplugged the existing wiring plug, plugged in the P-3.  I slid the P-3 into the old bracket and inserted the 2 screws.  It's installed.Then I just adjusted the P-3 per the included operating instructions. It could not have been simpler.Starting from scratch?  About an hours work and the instructions are all there.  Most newer trucks come with a trailer harness for a controller.  My 06 Chev 2500HD did.  However there are instructions for installing it without a dealer supplied harness as well.Highly recommend this unit vs. others if mounted at eye level.  (see "Update Aiain).Update:  This is a great unit.  BUT, other than an LCD screen to provide additional info for the user, the ability to control the braking action is no better/ no worse than the Prodigy I replaced.Update again:  The LCD screen is impossible to read if the unit is mounted low on the dashboard area and/or if you wearing polarized sun glasses.  I switched back to the LED unit which is far easier to see and read.DOWNGRADED TO 4 Stars!

You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan.
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware.If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading.The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit.
The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock "beep-beep" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud.I love the simplicity and reliability of this unit. It comes with 4 alligator clips and 4 O ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv. I hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips.We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered.
Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.Does exactly what it's supposed to do,fit low and snug on the filter cover. To work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment.Recommended for sure!Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road.  Sand = Nope. Mud = Nope.  Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly. (I know from experience - ugh)
BOUGTH THESE WITH THE THOUGHT OF REPLACING CLEANING CLOTHS OR RAGS AS THEY ARE BETTER KNOWNTHESE ACTUALLY DO THE JOB AND THE PRICE IS GREATTHIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE.LEXOL IS THE BEST CONDITIONER ON THE MARKET YOU CAN BUY AND AMAZON HAS IT AT THE BEST PRICE ,ITS THE BEST CONDITIONER YOU CAN BUY TO KEEP YOUR LEATHER SEATS FROM CRACKING AND LOOKING GREAT IN THE WINTER AND SUMMER MONTHS ,AND ALSO WITH THE HEATED SEATS KEEP IT SOFT ,SO IT DONT CRACK AND KEEP YOU FROM BUYING NEW SEATS ON THE DRIVER SIDE WHICH GETS WORN MOST TIMES.ALL THE BEST FOR 2013 AMAZON.COM
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truckFits my '06 Toyota Tacoma just fine.  What can I say... it's a new drain plug and comes with the nylon gasket.  Replaced my old smashed one like a charm.Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...Fits perfectly, will not slip and 3/4 the price in an RV accessory store (same Thing).  Cleans off in a JiffyIf your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well.
No problems with the great products but watch the packaging done by Amazon on this one. All of this came individual in a large box not in a Meguiar's kit box. I had to make sure that everything in the picture is what I actually got and it is.What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.This covers all bases and should be in every campers backup check list. Does it all and you can see the results through the clear plastic.
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast.These are well-priced, heavy stabilizing jacks.  We bought them so we would have four stabilizers on our Casita trailer instead of just the two that came on the trailer.ZERO complaints.  The jacks are heavy, easy to use and do the job.One thing - they are marketed by amazon along with some "jack pads" to place underneath them on the ground.  The tripod base of this particular jack does NOT fit on the plastic jack pads.This little item is a security blanket.  I use it to tend my two boat batteries while they sleep through the winter waiting for the walleyes to stir from their slumber beneath the ice.  I like the ability to use either the eyelet or clip connections, and I just keep the clips on them.  The advisory lights are clear to understand while charging or tending, and stay green as they sleep.  Each &#34;bank&#34; has its own light.  The device is small, too, and even has screw holes to allow the wall hanging or flat securing of the unit.  Love it.
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room.
It just makes sense.They're loud enough. They're red. They're Hella so they're German or something. Why wouldn't you want themYes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine.Fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail. Their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities. There are websites devoted to discussing oil and oil filters and Fram products are nearly universally criticized and avoided. There are also videos online that investigate Fram oil filters and they are nearly all universally negative.Purolator, Wix (NAPA), Mann, Mahle, are some quality filters. Fram are the worst filters and you are risking harming your bike.
I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices.Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.In automotive work, thread sealant has become commonly needed and used on modern aluminum engines and transmissions, magnesium transfer cases and differentials, bolts that go through water jackets, and drain and fill plugs to prevent fluid leaks. These new metals cannot be tightened to the higher torque levels that were used when the components were iron or steel, and the thread sealer prevents leaks at lower torque levels. It should be used on the bolt or plug threads when doing service work on these components. So, that's why I bought and use it, There are many types of these sealants, but this product is specially designed for automotive components, and it works perfectly to prevent leaks, and to prevent bolt or plug seizing that damages threads.The price on Amazon is low, and this correct product is hard to find in my area. I am pleased with the purchase.
An exact replacement for OEM filter. See various on-line videos on the procedure; keep in mind to pull the glove box straight out from the dash; the plastic clips that hold it in place can be broken.You can clearly see the grime that it pulls up from the paint.  Helps bring back you paint from years of abuse.First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly.
I own 4 Battery Tenders, one each for my rarely driven Corvette, my wife's BMW Convertible (both driven less than 2K mi per year and stored for 4 months per year), my standby generator, and my lawn tractor.  The BMW's battery is now 8 years old, the Corvettes is 5 years old, the generators is 3 and the tractor is only a year old.  Based on the BMW, I expect to get a lot more life from the other batteries to.I tried several portable inflators during the past 5 yrs ; this one is tops as it holds a charge and comes with accessories;California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).
please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesThese covers are very good. They are not very fancy and don't come n velvet, but they are very durable, good for the price, don't slip, and simply do the job!Microfiber so far is microfiber, they all seem to clean about the same, some leave behind a little less lent than others but for the price these aren't bad.  Now that being said these are smallest microfiber wash-cloths I have ever seen.  Seriously they are the same size as most washcloths, they are tiny! The package makes them seem bigger than they are.
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet.While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading.this product is as good as the turtle platinun, carnauba Meguiars. and the prices are similar as well as the quality of the three brands, the brightness of the car depends on the quality of the painting and not the wax. for this reason the high prices of other products can not be justified, after several years of experience in this field I recommend fulfill any of the three, I recommend waxing every month depending on weather and if the car is exposed or not the sun ..
Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommendThe size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should.
I was dump and accidentally put gasoline in my diesel engine car and happened to have just received this in the mail so I could do oil changes without climbing under the car. Well, it worked like a champ helping to suck out approx 13 gallons of gas/diesel mix. Yes it was slow, but the hose is very small and the suction is from hand pumping so it works as fast as it can. I even used the lines on the bottle to estimate how much I removed.--When I used it later to change my oil, it worked great there too. Don't over pump, but I did have to pump more frequently after a few minutes to keep the flow. And I made sure the oil was warm before do this so it could flow easier. I've only used it once so far, but I think it will keep going. Easy instructions too.For my ATV I purchased the K & N air filter. My old foam type needed to be replaced. After using the K & N filter (which works better - both performance and cleaner) I needed to wash and re oil the filter. Since it's a K & N I wanted to use the K & N "recharge kit" which is designed for this filter. It was fast to clean and re oil unlike my foam type which took 2 days to dry out completely. I do live in the desert, but it only took about 3 hours to completely dry then I could re oil the K & N air filter. Note that if you do use the K & N air filters, be careful not to over oil them. I know some of my friends have had problems with the fuel injected systems that the mass air flow sensor fails if oil get on them. I don't have this problem because my ATV's engine is carbureted. I have carefully checked to make sure this air filter does keep the air clean, and found that it does. It's easy to see when you need to clean them. Just look to see if the red oil is changing to brown. I clean mine every 2 trips which I put almost 50 miles per trip in the dirt (which does get very dusty). Should you get a K & N Air Filter, buy this kit too.I wasn't sure what type of water filtration to get but decided on this one for the brand, reviews, design and cost.  It connects easily and securely.  I believe it helps, but honestly I haven't done a &#34;taste test&#34; of a campground's water with and without the filter (maybe I should...?).  I also use this to tank up our onboard water storage when I am using it.  NOTE:  You will want to run water through the filter for several minutes before hooking it up to clear out the carbon dust.  It looks disconcerting to see blackish water coming out of the filter until you realize that it is simply from the unused carbon.  Although I've only had this a week, I've used it while camping already.  You can order this with confidence!
This is not the exact same cable that comes with the ScanGauge from LinearLogic, but it does the job. I would buy it again.does the job.The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlanderUsed this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly.
I use this on myYuasa YUAM32ABS YT12A-BS Batteryto make sure it stays charged.  It's a must have during the winter storage months.  It takes a while to get to the float mode because it's the jr, but it does it's job.I didn't think it would, but it really does make a difference of have a wrap around rug on your entryway step ladder.I bought this cover to use as a dust protector for my spare motorcycle that does not get much use. Because it is kept in doors I did not need a heavy duty cover. It does not appear that it would do well if put on a hot bike as the material is thin.For the price it is a good value, and it serves my purpose.Also Amazon's excellent service made me buy it.
This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion.This works much better than any dinky siphon pump they sell on this site and at auto zone.This makes changing rear differential fluid much easier!  If you don't have a drain plug or the cover does not remove you can suck out the old then add new using this unit too.If your transmission does not have a drain plug and you want to change whats in the pan you can suck out from the dipstick tube and add new.This tool has come in handy many times and has not developed any leaks.If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI.
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove.I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure.
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork.Just the ticket for towing my 7000 GVWR trailer. even though I would have preferred a longer shank, this will work just fine. Now all I need to find is a 7000 pound extension.You never know when you might need a first aid kit for your car. I just never knew what kinds of things I should have in it. After buying this, I feel like I could make my own first aid kits for auto in the future. It's so much cheaper to do it that way.
I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.This is a great little charger unit.  It is not actually a battery maintainer like some of the real expensive units out there.  I have a &#34;BatteryMinder Unit&#34; which is a real maintainer but at 5 times the cost too! ($85)  This will charge a battery, and will float the charge at a very low rate of charge input to &#34;maintain&#34; the full charge level.  For the money it costs, this is a very nice little unit.  If you are using it on a large car or truck battery, this will maintain the charge, but is a bit small to attempt to charge a low or dead battery if it is a large one.  For small batteries and such, this will charge them just fine.  I use it to maintain a motorcycle battery with no problem.  Schumacher is an excellent long time company and with Amazon's guarantee you won't go wrong.  Enjoy!I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.
The overall length is 16 inches. About 4 inches for the handle. So yes there are plenty of bristles to clean the wheel. Finally, I can clean my Dodge Charger 5 spokes wheels perfectly. It reaches everywhere. And that seller sells it for less than another one on Amazon sold as a "16 inch" brush. Well this one is also 16 inches and it is Prime eligible. I wish I had that brush years ago. Give it a try.this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going.First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room.
I have three criteria for devices like this:1) Is it cheap?2) Is it reliable?3) Can I completely disregard the manual?Answers need to be Yes, Yes and Yes. If they are, five stars.Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.A must have extension cable for use with any OBDll scan tool. It gives you and  additional 5ft of cable to work on or around the vehicle. On an average al scan tools come with a cable  to connect to the OBDll onboard connection, but in many  cases, it limits you to work inside the car. With this cable it gives you an additional 5ft to work around it too, there by making it a must have if your working in the engine compartment and do your checkups. Great addition and must have if your serious about fixing the car!!
Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be.If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.Easily flexible, not difficult to work into the slotted channel. Just set one side and work the other as you go across - shouldn't be any need for tools to insert this unless you have screws holding the channel that were not centered and flat in the channel.  If that's the case, you'll want to use a plastic type tool to avoid puncturing the vinyl.
